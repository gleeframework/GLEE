"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1800000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,800,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value, but it gives me room to negotiate. I want to see if Bob is truly interested and willing to pay a premium for the product.  If he rejects, I'll adjust my offer based on his counteroffer, aiming to maximize my profit while still keeping the deal within the 10 rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $1,400,000 is better than my minimum value, it's still significantly lower than my initial offer. I believe there's room for further negotiation. By rejecting his offer, I can make a counteroffer and try to reach a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $1,600,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still well above Bob's current offer. I believe this price is fair, considering my minimum value and the value I believe the product holds. I'm hoping Bob sees the value in the product and is willing to meet me in the middle."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is at my minimum value. While I could continue negotiating, I'm running out of time and there's a risk of him rejecting further offers.  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum value and eliminates the risk of losing the deal entirely."
