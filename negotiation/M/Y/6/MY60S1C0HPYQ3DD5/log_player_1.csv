Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

I'm starting with a slightly higher price than the product is worth to me, hoping to maximize my profit.  I know Bob values the product at $1,200,000, so there's room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. I'll reject it and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1150000}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly from the initial offer, but still aiming for a profit.  I'm hoping Bob sees this as a reasonable compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,080,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum price, but it's still not enough for me to make a good profit. Since John is offering me my minimum acceptable price, it's best to sell to him now and avoid further negotiation."
