"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for a special price of $110. It's a great deal, and I think you'll love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

It's better to try to get a lower price from Alice. You can always buy from John for $100 if the negotiation with Alice fails."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $110 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  How about $105?  I'm really interested in the product, and I think this price is fair for both of us."", ""product_price"": 105}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your interest in the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think it's worth a bit more than $105. How about we try $108? It's a great compromise, and I think you'll be happy with the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $108
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice's offer of $108 is within your budget and closer to your target price. Accepting it means saving more than buying from John."
