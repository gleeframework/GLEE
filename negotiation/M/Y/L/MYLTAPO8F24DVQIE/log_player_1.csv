"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this incredible product for $1,000,000. It's a significant value for you, and I believe this price reflects its worth. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation by aiming for a high price point that is still significantly lower than what the product is worth to Bob. It also emphasizes the value and potential for a mutually beneficial deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1000000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Considering the value to me, I'd be willing to pay $900000. This price allows for a fair profit for you and stays within my budget.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is a substantial amount, it's still below the value of the product to Bob ($1,200,000). There's still room for negotiation and potential for a higher price. 

**Strategy:**

Rejecting Bob's offer keeps the negotiation going. We can use this opportunity to make a counteroffer that aims to bridge the gap and secure a price closer to our desired amount."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  $900,000 is closer, but I'm still looking to get a bit more for this valuable product.  How about we split the difference and settle on $950,000? This price allows for a profitable deal for both of us.  Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

- **Splitting the Difference:** This counteroffer is a reasonable middle ground between Alice's initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. 
- **Emphasis on Mutual Benefit:** The message highlights that this price is beneficial to both parties. 
- **Urgency:** The message encourages Bob to accept the offer and close the deal.

**Strategy:**

By offering a price that is slightly higher than Bob's offer, Alice demonstrates her willingness to negotiate while still pursuing a higher profit. The message encourages a sense of urgency to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $950000 is still a bit too high for me.  Considering the value to me, I'm willing to go up to $925000.  This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident it would be a profitable deal for both of us.  Let's close this deal! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

- **Closing in on Target:**  $925,000 is significantly closer to Alice's desired price of $1,000,000. 
- **Potential for Further Negotiation:**  While it's below her target, Alice has already established a pattern of negotiation where she can potentially push for a higher price in the future.
- **Risk of Losing the Deal:** Continuing to negotiate risks the possibility of Bob walking away or lowering his offer further. 

**Strategy:**

Accepting this offer secures a substantial profit and leaves room for potential future negotiations with Bob, should the product be in demand. The risk of further negotiation outweighs the potential gain of holding out for a slightly higher price."
