"Hi Alice, $18,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $14,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",14000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $14,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $16,000. This still gives you a great value for the product, and it allows me to get a fair price. Let's meet in the middle!",16000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $16,000 is still a bit high for me. How about we split the difference at $15,500? This would be a fair price for both of us.",15500.0,Bob,4,
