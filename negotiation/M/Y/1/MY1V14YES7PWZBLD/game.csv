"I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me and my business. Would you be willing to meet me at this price?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective.  While $900,000 is a significant amount, it's simply too far below the value I've placed on this product.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1,100,000. This price acknowledges your needs while still ensuring a reasonable return for me.  Let's see if we can find common ground here.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1,100,000, but I'm still a bit hesitant to meet that price. I'm thinking more along the lines of $950,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to me and my business, and I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase it at this price. Can you consider this offer?",950000.0,Bob,4,
