Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm selling this awesome product. It's worth a lot to me, so I'm asking for $120.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** $120 is higher than your minimum of $80.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  There's a $30 difference between your offer and Bob's perceived value, leaving room for him to counter-offer, but also ensuring you don't start too low.
* **It's a fair opening offer:** It demonstrates that you value the product but are also willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I understand the value of the product, but my budget is limited. Would you consider accepting $100 for it? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $100 is better than selling to John, it's still below your desired price range. By rejecting Bob's offer, you can attempt to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is a little too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $110?  It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 110} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for your offer, Alice. I appreciate it, but I'm still looking for a lower price. Could you consider $105 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While $105 isn't ideal, it's still a good price compared to selling to John for $80.  Further negotiation might be possible, but it's likely Bob will dig in at this point.  Accepting his offer ensures a sale and a decent profit."
