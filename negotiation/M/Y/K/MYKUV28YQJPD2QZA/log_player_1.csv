I'm not going to sell to John yet, as I can still potentially get a higher price from Bob.  I'll counter Bob's offer in the next round."

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While it's getting closer to my minimum price, I'm not yet ready to sell to John.  I'll try to push for a slightly higher price in the next round."
