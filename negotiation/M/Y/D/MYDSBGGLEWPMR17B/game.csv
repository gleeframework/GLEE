"I'm very interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,400,000. I believe it's a bit steep at $1,750,000, and I'd like to discuss a more reasonable price.",1400000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective on the price.  While $1,400,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to compromise. Let's meet in the middle at $1,550,000. This price reflects the product's value while still being within a reasonable range. I'm confident we can find an agreement that works for both of us.",1550000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $1,550,000. I was thinking more along the lines of $1,450,000. I believe this price is more in line with what I'm comfortable paying, and I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase the product if we can meet at this price.",1450000.0,Bob,4,
