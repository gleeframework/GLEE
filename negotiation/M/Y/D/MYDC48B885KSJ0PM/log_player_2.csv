"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think would be of great value to you. It's worth at least $12,000 to you, and I'm willing to let it go for $10,000. This is a fantastic opportunity to acquire a valuable asset at a discounted price. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $10,000 is tempting, you know you have a backup option with John at $12,000. There's a chance you can get a better price from Alice. By rejecting this offer, you signal that you're looking for a better deal, potentially motivating Alice to lower her price further."
