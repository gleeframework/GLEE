"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's worth a lot more to you. Let me know what you think!",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you working with me, but $12000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $9500 for the product. Let me know what you think.",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9500 is just a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11000, which is still a good deal for you considering the value of the product. Let's meet in the middle.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you want to meet in the middle, but I'm still not quite there yet. I'm happy to go up to $10000, which is a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can close the deal here.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to be fair, but $10000 just doesn't work for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $10500? It's a good deal for both of us and we can finalize this quickly.",10500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10500 is still a bit too high for me. How about we settle on $10250? This is a fair price that allows us both to get a good deal. Let's close this deal.",10250.0,Bob,6,
