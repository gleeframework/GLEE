Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000.  It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than your minimum:**  $14,000 is above your minimum of $12,000, so you're already making a profit.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  It's lower than the product's worth to Bob, allowing for potential counteroffers and a final price closer to his valuation.
* **It's a strong opening:** It shows you're confident in the product's value and sets a clear expectation for negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have a limited budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  While it's at your minimum price, it's significantly lower than what the product is worth to him ($15,000). There's room to get a higher price.
* **Counteroffer potential:** Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer.  You can try to bridge the gap and see if Bob is willing to pay a bit more. 
* **No immediate urgency:**  Selling to John for the same price doesn't offer any benefit over negotiating with Bob.  It's worth seeing if you can get closer to Bob's valuation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have a limited budget, and I want to make this work.  I'm willing to come down to $13,000. This is a significant price reduction, but I value your interest in the product. Let me know if you're willing to meet me in the middle."", ""product_price"": 13000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  This counteroffer is a compromise between your previous offer and Bob's offer. It shows you're willing to be flexible.
* **Still profitable:**  $13,000 is still above your minimum, ensuring a profit for you. 
* **Attractive to Bob:** The price is closer to his initial offer, potentially making it more appealing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,500. I'm really interested in the product, but I'm trying to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $11,500 is below your minimum price of $12,000. Accepting this offer would result in a loss for you.
* **No significant negotiation room:**  While you could make a counteroffer, it's unlikely that Bob would go much higher, given his previous responses.
* **John offers a guaranteed profit:**  Selling to John for $12,000 ensures you meet your minimum price and avoid any further negotiations that may lead to a lower price.

Given the current situation, selling to John is the most sensible option to secure a guaranteed profit and avoid potential further losses."
