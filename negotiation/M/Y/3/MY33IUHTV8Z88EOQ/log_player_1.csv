{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to buy this product for $140. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** My goal is to get as close to Bob's $150 valuation as possible. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $140 leaves a little wiggle room if Bob wants to negotiate, but still ensures a significant profit above my minimum ($100).
* **Alternative Buyer:**  Knowing I have John as a backup buyer at $100 gives me leverage. I'm not desperate to sell below my minimum."
