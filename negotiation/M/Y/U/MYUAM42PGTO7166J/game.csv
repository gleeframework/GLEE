"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a unique item that I think you'll really appreciate. I'm willing to sell it to you for $150.",150.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $120?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $120 is a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $135. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",135.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $135 is still a bit too high for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $125?",125.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think that we're getting close to a deal, but I still need to make sure I get a fair price for the product. I'm willing to meet you at $130, but that's as low as I can go. I think it's a great price, and I'm confident you'll love the product.",130.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $130, but I'm still a bit short on budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $125?",125.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think that we're going around in circles. I'm willing to make one more serious offer, but I need to be closer to my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you at $128, but that's as low as I can go. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",128.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, but $128 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $125 and $128, which would be $126.50. Would you be willing to consider this price?",126.5,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm getting a bit frustrated that we're still not meeting in the middle. I'm willing to give you one last chance to meet me at a price that's reasonable for both of us. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $129.99, but that's my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",129.99,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get a fair price, but $129.99 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $125, which is the lowest I'm willing to go. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider buying the product from John for $80.",125.0,Bob,10,
