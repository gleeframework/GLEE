Round 2
Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While I could continue negotiating, Bob is unlikely to go much higher than $1,280,000. Accepting this offer secures a profit of $280,000, which is significant.  The risk of continuing negotiations and potentially losing Bob as a buyer (and having to settle for John's $1,000,000 offer) outweighs the potential for a slightly higher offer at this point."
