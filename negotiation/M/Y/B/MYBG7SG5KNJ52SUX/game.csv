"I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $12,000. I'm willing to pay that much, but I don't think it's worth more than that.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $12,000 is below its true value.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,500?",13500.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you think the product is worth more, but I'm still not convinced it's worth $13,500. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $12,800. I'm willing to compromise, but I don't want to go above that.",12800.0,Bob,4,
