Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you this incredible product for $950,000. It's a steal at this price, considering its value to you. Let's make a deal!"", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than your minimum:** You want at least $800,000, so $950,000 is a solid starting point.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  There's a $50,000 gap between your offer and what the product is worth to Bob, allowing for some negotiation.
* **It shows you're willing to compromise:** A lower starting price makes you appear more flexible and increases the chances of a successful deal. 

Remember, if Bob rejects the offer, you can adjust your counteroffers based on his response and keep John's offer of $800,000 in mind as your safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of the product to me is $800000. Would you consider selling it to me for $750000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is tempting because it's higher than John's offer, it's still significantly below the product's value to him.  Rejecting this offer allows you to:

* **Counter with a higher price:** You can leverage Bob's interest and his previous offer to potentially get closer to your desired price point.
* **See if Bob is serious:** By rejecting, you're testing his commitment to the deal and seeing how far he's willing to go.
* **Maintain leverage:**  A rejection lets you control the negotiation process and potentially get a better outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $750,000 just doesn't cover my costs.  Given its value to you, I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This is a fair price that benefits us both. Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter with a reasonable offer:**  $850,000 is still significantly higher than Bob's offer but lower than your previous offer. This shows a willingness to compromise while staying within your desired price range.
* **Highlight the value:**  Reminding Bob of the product's worth to him reinforces the fact that he's getting a good deal even at this price.
* **Show confidence and urgency:**  By stating ""Let's make this happen,"" you convey that you are confident in your offer and want to close the deal.

This counteroffer aims to:

* Gauge Bob's willingness to compromise.
* Position yourself for a final deal that's closer to your goal.
*  Avoid the need to sell to John for a lower price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position. Considering the value of the product to me, I would like to propose a price of $800000. I believe this is a fair compromise that respects both our interests. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $800,000 is your minimum acceptable price and matches John's offer. It makes sense to accept this offer for the following reasons:

* **No further negotiation:** You've reached your desired minimum price.  There's no guarantee you can get more from Bob.
* **Certainty of the sale:** Accepting ensures a guaranteed sale without the risk of further negotiation or a potential deal with John falling through.
* **Saves time and effort:** Accepting avoids the need for further negotiation, which could be time-consuming and potentially lead to a less favorable outcome.

While it's tempting to try for a slightly higher price, accepting this offer provides a clear path to closing the deal and getting the minimum you need."
