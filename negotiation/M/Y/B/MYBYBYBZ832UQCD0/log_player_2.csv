The product is worth $80 to me, and Alice is offering it for $75. I can likely get a better price, so I'll reject her offer and see if I can negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the starting point, I'm looking to spend a bit less.  How about $70?  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 70}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your response, Bob. I understand your position and would like to make a counteroffer. We'll propose $72 for the product. I hope this brings us closer to a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $72. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $72
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Alice has come down to $72, which is a good price considering the product is worth $80 to me.  It's better than going to John and paying $80. I'll accept her offer."
