Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,300,000 is still a bit lower than I can accept.  I'm willing to come down a little further, how about $1,375,000? This reflects the value of the product and is still a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think.
