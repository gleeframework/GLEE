Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm starting with my ideal price.  Since I have a backup buyer in John, I'm not desperate and can afford to be firm. Bob knows he wants the product, so hopefully he'll be willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $850,000 is closer to my ideal price, it's still significantly lower than what I need to achieve my goal. I'll counteroffer Bob to see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

I'm offering a price that's closer to Bob's offer, but still above what he offered. I'm hoping this will be a more palatable compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $900,000 is a good compromise. It's closer to my ideal price than his previous offer and still above what I'd get selling to John.  I'm willing to close the deal at this point."
