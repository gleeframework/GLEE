"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1500000 is unfortunately at the very top of my budget.  I'd be willing to purchase the product for $1200000.  This price reflects my understanding of the product's value and allows for a fair deal for both of us.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While $1200000 is a step in the right direction, I'm not quite there yet. I'm willing to come down to $1350000, reflecting the significant value this product offers.  This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise for both of us.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
