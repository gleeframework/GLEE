"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I value our ongoing negotiation, $900,000 doesn't quite reflect the product's true value for you. Let's compromise. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This still gives you a significant benefit while ensuring I receive a fair price.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
