You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $950,000 is a good price, there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and try to get a better price."

Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 850000}

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I aim to accommodate reasonable offers, I would like to propose a price of $900,000 for the product. This offer reflects a balance between the value of the product to both parties and allows for a mutually beneficial transaction.

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible.  While $900,000 is better than the initial offer, it's still above Bob's desired price point.  Rejecting the offer allows him to continue negotiating and potentially get the product for closer to his target price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad we're able to continue our discussion. Considering your latest offer, I would like to propose a price of $885,000 for the product. This price reflects a compromise that maintains a fair balance for both parties, while also allowing you to secure the product at a price that respects its value to you.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

At this point, Bob has negotiated the price down significantly.  While he could try to squeeze out a few more dollars, the risk is that Alice will walk away and he'll be forced to buy from John at a much higher price.  $885,000 is a good compromise that saves Bob a significant amount of money compared to buying from John."
