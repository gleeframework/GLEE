Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase a product that I know you'll find incredibly valuable.  Given its potential, I'm offering it at $1,400,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the significant benefit it offers you."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** I want to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($1,500,000) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting a bit lower gives Bob the feeling he's getting a better deal if he negotiates you down slightly.
* **Time Value:** While John offers a guaranteed $1,000,000, a quick sale to Bob at a higher price is more profitable. 

This offer balances getting the best price from Bob while still making the offer attractive enough to accept."
