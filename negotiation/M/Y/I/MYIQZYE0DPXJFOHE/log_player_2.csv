Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your prompt response, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your valuation of the product. In light of that, I am willing to consider your offer but need to ensure the transaction aligns with our business objectives. Therefore, I propose a counteroffer of $850,000 for the product. This price reflects a compromise that maintains a reasonable profit margin for us while respecting your budget constraints. I look forward to your consideration of this proposal.

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down from her initial price, which is good.  However, you are still within striking distance of your ideal price, so you can push a bit more. Rejecting this offer allows you to counteroffer again, potentially getting even closer to $800,000."
