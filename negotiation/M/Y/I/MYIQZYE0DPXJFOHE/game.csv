"Thank you for your prompt response, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your valuation of the product. In light of that, I am willing to consider your offer but need to ensure the transaction aligns with our business objectives. Therefore, I propose a counteroffer of $850,000 for the product. This price reflects a compromise that maintains a reasonable profit margin for us while respecting your budget constraints. I look forward to your consideration of this proposal.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I understand your need for a profit, $850,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm prepared to pay $825,000, which is a fair price for both of us.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal at that point.",825000.0,Bob,4,
