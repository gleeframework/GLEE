"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this great product. I think it would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $150. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 150
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make an offer of $110. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
``` 

While Bob's offer of $110 is closer to my minimum price, I know John is ready to buy at $120. It makes more financial sense to sell to John immediately and avoid further negotiation."
