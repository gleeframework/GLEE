Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $12000 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $9500. Can you consider that?

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $9,500 is simply not enough for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $11,000?  That's still a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 11000}

I'm selling the product to John.  I've been through several rounds of negotiation with Bob, and it seems like we're not going to be able to agree on a price.  It's better to take the sure $15,000 from John than to continue haggling with Bob."
