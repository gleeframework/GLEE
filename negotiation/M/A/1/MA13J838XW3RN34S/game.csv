"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,200,000 might be a bit high, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,000,000. This is my best offer, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair price for this exceptional product.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1,000,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $850,000. This is my final offer. ",850000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $850,000 is still below my minimum price. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer, and I'll meet you at $900,000. This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower.",900000.0,Alice,5,
