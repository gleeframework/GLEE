"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting high, at $15,000. This is a good starting point, leaving room for negotiation while still reflecting the product's value to me. It's important to gauge Bob's reaction and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. While it's tempting to take $10,000, I have 10 rounds and I believe I can do better. I will reject his offer and counter with a more reasonable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000} 
```

I'm dropping the price to $12,000. This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate, while still maintaining a decent profit margin.  I believe this price point is fair and might be more appealing to Bob."
