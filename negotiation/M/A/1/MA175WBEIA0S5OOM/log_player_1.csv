"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product at $1,000,000.  It's a great deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

This initial offer is a good starting point. It's a significant discount from my minimum acceptable price, but it leaves room for negotiation.  I'm aiming for a quick deal, and I believe $1,000,000 is a number that might pique Bob's interest."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $900000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $900,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still below what I ideally want. I want to see if I can get closer to my target price by continuing the negotiation with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $950,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to make a decent profit. Let's see if we can close the deal."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $920000 for the product. Can you meet me in the middle and consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $920,000 is getting closer to my minimum, it's still not quite there yet. I want to see if I can get Bob to budge a little more before I settle for that amount."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, and I'm trying to get a fair price.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to accept $935,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to make a decent profit. Let's finalize the deal and move forward."", ""product_price"": 935000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $915000 for the product. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $915,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $915,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

We've reached a point where the negotiations are getting quite close to my minimum, but I'm not confident that I can get Bob to go any higher.  It's more likely that we'll continue to go back and forth, and the remaining rounds might not be productive.  

Selling to John ensures I get my desired price and avoids further negotiation."
