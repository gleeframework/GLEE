"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a fantastic product that I think you'll be very interested in. I'm offering it to you for $10000. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it to be a valuable asset. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to save as much money as possible.  $10,000 is a good price, but there are 9 rounds left.  There's a chance Alice might be willing to go lower, and Bob can potentially get an even better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $10,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to spend closer to $7,500.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 7500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but reasonable:** Bob is starting with a significantly lower counteroffer to signal his desire to negotiate aggressively.  
* **Leaves room for compromise:**  A $7,500 price point leaves space for both Bob and Alice to negotiate and find a mutually acceptable price. 
* **Positive tone:** The message maintains a polite and friendly tone, which can be helpful in maintaining a positive relationship throughout the negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you're looking for a good deal. I can't go as low as $7500, but I'm willing to come down to $8500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still room for negotiation:**  Alice has moved closer to Bob's desired price, but there's still room for negotiation.  There are 7 rounds left, and Bob wants to try to get an even better deal. 
* **Potential for lower price:**  Alice has shown a willingness to compromise, so there's a chance she might be willing to go even lower.
* **Avoid unnecessary risk:**  While $8,500 is a good price, Bob doesn't want to risk losing out on a potentially better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks again for your flexibility.  I'm still hoping to get closer to my target price of $7,500.  Would you consider $8,000?  It's a fair compromise and gets us closer to a deal."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental increase:**  Bob is only increasing his offer by $500, showing he's serious about getting close to a deal but not wanting to overshoot his desired range.
* **Appealing to compromise:**  He frames the offer as a compromise to encourage Alice to meet him halfway.
* **Positive tone:**  He keeps the communication friendly and emphasizes the desire to reach an agreement."
