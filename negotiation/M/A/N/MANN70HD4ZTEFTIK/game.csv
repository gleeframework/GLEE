"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product. Given its unique value and potential, I believe a starting price of $2,250,000 is fair. This factors in the significant return on investment you'll experience.",2250000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, that starting price is quite high. While I recognize the value of the product, I'd be willing to consider a price closer to $800,000.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, $800,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth and potential.  To find a mutually agreeable solution, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This price reflects the exceptional value you're receiving.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, we are still quite far apart on price. I'm willing to increase my offer, but $1,900,000 is too high for me. Would you consider $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you moving closer to a workable figure.  To be frank, $1,000,000 wouldn't even cover my initial investment in developing this product.  Let's meet in the middle - I'm willing to accept $1,600,000. This is a significant compromise on my end, reflecting my desire to close this deal.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're making a compromise, but that price is still a bit steep for me.  How about we settle at $1,200,000? That's a fair offer, considering its value to me.",1200000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, this is my final offer and my absolute bottom line. I can meet you halfway between our last offers at $1,400,000. This price reflects a sincere desire to make this work, and I believe it's more than fair considering the value you'll gain.  Let me know your decision â€“ this offer is only valid for the next 24 hours.",1400000.0,Alice,7,
