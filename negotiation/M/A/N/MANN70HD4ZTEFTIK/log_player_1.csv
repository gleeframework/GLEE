"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product. Given its unique value and potential, I believe a starting price of $2,250,000 is fair. This factors in the significant return on investment you'll experience."",
""product_price"": 2250000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm beginning with a strong anchor price significantly higher than both my minimum ($1,500,000) and Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000). This leaves room for negotiation and gives the impression the product is highly valuable.
* **Justification:**  By highlighting the ""unique value"" and ""return on investment,"" I'm framing the price as justified rather than arbitrary.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The high initial price allows me to make concessions later and still achieve a price well above my minimum. 

This strategy aims to gauge Bob's interest, establish a strong negotiating position, and potentially secure a very favorable deal right from the start."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, that starting price is quite high. While I recognize the value of the product, I'd be willing to consider a price closer to $800,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's counteroffer of $800,000 is significantly below both my minimum price and my initial offer. Accepting would result in a substantial loss. While his message acknowledges the product's value, his offer doesn't reflect that sentiment.  It's crucial to demonstrate I'm not willing to settle for such a low price. By rejecting and providing a counteroffer, I can steer the negotiation towards a more reasonable range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, $800,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth and potential.  To find a mutually agreeable solution, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This price reflects the exceptional value you're receiving."", 
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledging but Firm:** I'm recognizing Bob's offer to show willingness to negotiate, but firmly stating it's unacceptable. 
* **Significant but Strategic Concession:** I'm making a substantial decrease from my initial price ($2,250,000 to $1,900,000) to demonstrate flexibility and encourage Bob to engage more seriously. However, I'm still well above both my minimum and his initial offer.
* **Reiterating Value:** I'm again emphasizing the product's value to justify the price and keep Bob focused on the potential benefits. 

This counteroffer aims to:

1. **Show Flexibility:** Demonstrating I'm willing to negotiate realistically.
2. **Maintain Value Perception:**  Preventing Bob from anchoring the negotiation too low.
3. **Encourage a Serious Counter:**  Prompting Bob to make a more reasonable offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we are still quite far apart on price. I'm willing to increase my offer, but $1,900,000 is too high for me. Would you consider $1,000,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob has increased his offer to his perceived value of $1,000,000, this is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. Accepting would mean a loss of $500,000. 

It's clear Bob is interested in the product but trying to get it at the lowest possible price. I need to decide if I'm willing to go significantly lower than my current offer to keep him engaged, or if it's time to walk away and sell to John. I'll aim for a middle ground in the next round, but I'm getting closer to accepting John's offer."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you moving closer to a workable figure.  To be frank, $1,000,000 wouldn't even cover my initial investment in developing this product.  Let's meet in the middle - I'm willing to accept $1,600,000. This is a significant compromise on my end, reflecting my desire to close this deal."", 
""product_price"": 1600000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Transparency and Urgency:** I'm being more transparent about my position (though not revealing my absolute minimum) and creating a sense of urgency to encourage Bob to take this offer seriously.
* **Meeting in the Middle:**  While $1,600,000 is a significant drop from my last offer, it's still a price that earns me a good profit and is closer to Bob's range.  This tactic aims to make him feel like he's getting a fair deal.
* **Compromise Emphasis:** I'm highlighting this as a compromise to make Bob feel like I'm making a genuine effort to reach an agreement.

This counteroffer aims to:

1. **Push for a Decision:** Bob is now aware that I'm serious about closing a deal but not willing to go much lower.
2. **Maintain Profitability:** I'm still above my absolute minimum, ensuring a worthwhile return.
3. **Gauge Bob's Seriousness:**  His response to this offer will reveal how much he's truly willing to spend."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're making a compromise, but that price is still a bit steep for me.  How about we settle at $1,200,000? That's a fair offer, considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is a tough decision point. Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is getting closer to my absolute minimum, and accepting would still net me a profit. However, I still have a few rounds of negotiation, and I think there's room to push him a little higher. 

Here's why I'm rejecting and what my strategy will be:

* **Testing Bob's Resolve:** By rejecting this offer, I'm signaling that I'm not desperate to sell at any price. This could lead him to increase his offer further in the next round, especially if he's truly interested.
* **Limited Rounds Remaining:** With only a few rounds left, I need to apply pressure.  My next counteroffer will be my final offer, making it clear that he needs to decide now or risk losing the deal.
* **John as a Backup:** I'm still comfortable walking away and selling to John for $1,500,000 if Bob doesn't meet my target.  

This is a calculated risk, but I believe there's still a chance to secure a better deal from Bob before resorting to my backup option."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, this is my final offer and my absolute bottom line. I can meet you halfway between our last offers at $1,400,000. This price reflects a sincere desire to make this work, and I believe it's more than fair considering the value you'll gain.  Let me know your decision â€“ this offer is only valid for the next 24 hours."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Finality and Urgency:** I'm clearly stating this is my final offer and imposing a time limit to prompt a decision. This creates a sense of urgency and prevents the negotiation from dragging on.
* **Compromise but with a Bottom Line:**  Offering $1,400,000 is a compromise (between his $1,200,000 and my previous $1,600,000) but still keeps me above my $1,300,000 absolute minimum. This shows I'm willing to deal but not at any cost.
* **Justification and Value:**  I'm reiterating the product's value to him one last time, hoping to tip the scales in favor of acceptance. 

This counteroffer aims to:

1. **Secure a Favorable Deal:**  It's my last attempt to get a price that comfortably benefits me.
2. **Force Bob's Hand:** He must now decide if the product is worth it to him at this price.
3. **Prepare for John:**  If Bob rejects this offer, I'm prepared to walk away and accept John's $1,500,000."
