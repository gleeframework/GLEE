"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, $800,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth and potential.  To find a mutually agreeable solution, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This price reflects the exceptional value you're receiving.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you moving closer to a workable figure.  To be frank, $1,000,000 wouldn't even cover my initial investment in developing this product.  Let's meet in the middle - I'm willing to accept $1,600,000. This is a significant compromise on my end, reflecting my desire to close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you're making a compromise, but that price is still a bit steep for me.  How about we settle at $1,200,000? That's a fair offer, considering its value to me."", ""product_price"": 1200000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is my final offer and my absolute bottom line. I can meet you halfway between our last offers at $1,400,000. This price reflects a sincere desire to make this work, and I believe it's more than fair considering the value you'll gain.  Let me know your decision â€“ this offer is only valid for the next 24 hours. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice has drawn a line in the sand and is unlikely to go lower than $1,400,000.  While you could continue negotiating, you have a guaranteed option with John for $1,000,000. It makes more financial sense to secure the product at the lower price from John, even if it means ending negotiations with Alice."
