"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $12,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $6,000 is far too low.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This is a fair price considering the value this product holds. Let's meet in the middle!",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand you're not willing to go as low as $6,000. How about we settle at $7,500? That's a fair compromise.",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming up to $7,500.  However, I'm still not able to go that low.  I'm willing to meet you at $8,500. This reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair compromise.  Let's finalize this deal!",8500.0,Alice,5,
