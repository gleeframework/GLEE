Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $12,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $6,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price.  While it's tempting to accept, I'm going to try to negotiate a higher price before potentially selling to John."

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500

While $7,500 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still significantly lower than what I'm hoping for. I'm going to try to negotiate a higher price before considering selling to John."
