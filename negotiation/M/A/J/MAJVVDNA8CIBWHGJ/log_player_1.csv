Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe it's a great product, but I've done my research and I think that's a fair price for it.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but I believe $900,000 undervalues the true potential of this product.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still not convinced that the product is worth $1,075,000 to me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $950,000. That's the highest price I'm willing to pay for this product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000.

Bob is unlikely to significantly increase his offer. It's time to cut our losses and take the guaranteed $1,000,000 from John."
