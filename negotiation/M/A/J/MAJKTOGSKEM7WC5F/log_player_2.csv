"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you this exceptional product for $2000000. It's a rare opportunity to acquire something truly valuable. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is way over my budget. It's much more than I'm willing to pay, even for a potentially valuable product. It's best to try to negotiate a lower price before considering buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $2,000,000 is far beyond my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for this product. I believe this is a fair price considering the potential value and my limited budget. Let's see if we can work something out."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1000000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to compromise and offer it to you for $1750000. This price still allows you a considerable margin for profit, and it's a fair reflection of the product's worth. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial proposal, it's still above my limit. I'm willing to spend up to $1,000,000, and there's still room for negotiation. I'll try to counteroffer again and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price.  I'm also keeping the option of buying from John in mind as a fallback option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,750,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm sticking to my offer of $1,000,000. I believe this is a fair price, considering the potential value and my budget constraints. If you're not willing to accept this, I'll have to explore other options."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1000000 is simply not enough for me. I'm willing to come down to $1600000. This price still allows for a significant gain on your end, and it's a fair reflection of the product's unique qualities. Let's find a solution that benefits both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still higher than my maximum budget of $1,000,000.  Even though I'm nearing the middle ground, I'm not willing to budge yet. I'll try one more counteroffer to see if I can get closer to my target price. However, if this round doesn't work out, I'll seriously consider buying from John as he offers a guaranteed price that's within my budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your continued negotiation, but $1,600,000 is still beyond my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,200,000 for this product. It's a significant increase from my previous offer and shows my willingness to compromise.  Let's see if we can finally find a middle ground that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1200000 is still quite a bit lower than what this product is worth. I'm willing to come down to $1400000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's unique value and still allows for a reasonable profit for you. I'm hoping we can reach an agreement in the next few rounds. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting closer to my target, but it's still higher than what I'm comfortable paying.  I'm going to try one more counteroffer to see if I can reach a price closer to $1,200,000. However, with only three rounds left, I'm starting to feel the pressure.  If this round doesn't work out, I'll likely buy from John to avoid risking missing out on the product altogether."

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, we're getting closer, but $1,400,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,300,000. This is a significant step up from my last offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the potential value of the product.  Let's try to reach a final agreement this round.  If not, I'll need to explore other options."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
