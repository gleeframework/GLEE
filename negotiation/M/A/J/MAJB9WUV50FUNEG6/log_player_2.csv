"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase my product for $850,000. I believe it's a great deal for you, as you've expressed a willingness to pay $800,000 for it. This price allows us both to benefit from the transaction.  Let me know if you're interested. If not, I'll be selling it to John for $800,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is trying to bluff you. You know John will sell the product for $800,000, so there's no reason to accept Alice's higher offer. By rejecting her offer, you can call her bluff and likely get a better price or buy it from John at your desired price."
