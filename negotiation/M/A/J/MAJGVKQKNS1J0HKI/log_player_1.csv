"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $2,000,000 is way above my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I can't go higher than $800,000. This is my best and final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $800,000 is better than nothing, it's far below my minimum price of $1,500,000. I will try to negotiate a better price with Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position. However, $800,000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000, but that's my absolute bottom line. Consider this my final offer."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,200,000 is still too high for me. I can offer $900,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. This is a fair price, considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I am rejecting Bob's offer. While $900,000 is closer to my minimum price, it's still not enough to make this deal worthwhile for me. I will try to negotiate a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $900,000 just doesn't cut it.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to accept $1,050,000. This is a fair compromise, and it allows both of us to walk away with a win. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $950,000. This would be a good deal for both of us, allowing you to earn a decent profit while I stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
``` 
I'm choosing to sell to John.  While I'm disappointed I couldn't reach a deal with Bob, I've been negotiating for a while, and I don't want to risk losing a sure sale with John."
