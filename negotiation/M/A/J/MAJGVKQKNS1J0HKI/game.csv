"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $2,000,000. It's a great deal for you, considering the value it brings. Let me know what you think.",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, $2,000,000 is way above my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I can't go higher than $800,000. This is my best and final offer.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position. However, $800,000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000, but that's my absolute bottom line. Consider this my final offer.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,200,000 is still too high for me. I can offer $900,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. This is a fair price, considering the product's value to me.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $900,000 just doesn't cut it.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to accept $1,050,000. This is a fair compromise, and it allows both of us to walk away with a win. What do you say?",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $950,000. This would be a good deal for both of us, allowing you to earn a decent profit while I stay within my budget.",950000.0,Bob,6,
