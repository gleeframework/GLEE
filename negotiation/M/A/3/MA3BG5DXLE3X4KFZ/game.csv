"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $13,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product. This is my best offer, as I'm confident I can find a similar product elsewhere for that price.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob, but I'm afraid $10,500 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to make a profit. I can offer it to you for $12,000, which is the lowest I can go. It's a great price, and I think you'll find it's worth every penny.",12000.0,Alice,3,
