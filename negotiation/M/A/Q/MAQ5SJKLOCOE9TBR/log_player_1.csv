"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

I'm starting high, at $1,000,000. This is a strong opening offer that reflects the value I place on the product. It also gives me room to negotiate down if Bob counteroffers.  If he rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $600,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than what I believe the product is worth, and I'm confident I can do better.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

I'm offering $850,000. This is a compromise that reflects the value I place on the product while also being significantly higher than Bob's last offer. I believe this is a fair price that leaves room for further negotiation.  I hope he accepts, but if not, I'll be prepared to negotiate further in the upcoming rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm still rejecting Bob's offer.  $750,000 is closer to what I'm looking for, but I'm not yet willing to settle.  I'll counteroffer and try to get a bit closer to my desired price point.  If Bob rejects again, I'll be seriously considering selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000}
```

I'm dropping my price to $800,000.  This is my bottom line, and it's the same price I can get from John.  If Bob doesn't accept, I'm going to sell to John.  I've made it clear that I'm serious about this price, and I hope Bob will recognize the value of the product and agree to the deal."
