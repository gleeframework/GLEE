"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product. It's a starting point, and I'm open to further discussion.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, while I appreciate your offer, $1,000,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000.  This price is still fair considering the product's value to you. I'm open to further discussion if you're willing to move closer to this offer.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving on the price. However, $1,250,000 is still a bit more than I'd like to spend.  Would you consider $1,125,000? That's a significant jump from my previous offer and puts us closer to a middle ground.",1125000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,125,000 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,175,000 as a compromise. This is a fair price considering the value the product offers, and it's a significant step towards closing this deal.  What are your thoughts?",1175000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, thanks for working with me.  I see we are getting closer.  How about we split the difference and settle at $1,150,000?",1150000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,150,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,162,500.
