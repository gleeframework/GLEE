"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe it's a bit overpriced at $1,400,000.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $1,200,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000.  This reflects a significant discount from my initial offer, but it still allows me to achieve my desired price point. Let's see if we can find common ground here.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,300,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a more substantial offer. I'm willing to pay $1,150,000 for the product. This is my final offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement.",1150000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,150,000 is unfortunately still too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000. This is my final counteroffer. I'm confident this is a fair price for the value this product will bring you. Let's close this deal.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
