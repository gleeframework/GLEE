Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your initial offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. Considering the product's value, I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,600,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's worth while also being reasonable for me. What are your thoughts? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your revised offer, Alice. I understand your perspective on the product's potential, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. Considering the current market conditions and my budget constraints, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,800,000. This price takes into account the product's value while also being more realistic for me. What are your thoughts?

We are getting closer, but I still believe we can get a better deal than $1,800,000.  We will counter in the next round."

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. Considering our previous discussions, I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,750,000. This price takes into account the product's value while also being more realistic for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to stay within my budget. What are your thoughts? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","This is a tough decision point. Bob is clearly very interested but also trying to get a good deal. Let's analyze:

* **Current offer:** $1,750,000
* **John's offer:** $1,500,000 
* **Rounds left:** 4 

Bob is unlikely to go above $1,800,000 based on his negotiation pattern. We risk him walking away if we push too hard.

""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

While we could try to squeeze a bit more, accepting $1,750,000 is a strong deal given the circumstances and avoids the risk of losing Bob entirely."
