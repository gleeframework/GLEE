{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that's worth a lot to me. I'm willing to let it go for $18,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 18000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable value. This gives me room to negotiate downwards if needed.
* **Enthusiasm:** I'm expressing the value of the product to me in a way that might make Bob think it's valuable. 
* **Open-ended question:** The question ""What do you think?"" invites Bob to counteroffer, giving us a starting point for negotiation. 

It's important to remember that this is just the first step. I'll need to carefully evaluate Bob's response and adjust my strategy based on his reaction."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering the product. I understand its value to you, but my budget allows me to pay no more than $10000 for it. Would you consider accepting this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** While $10,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable value of $12,000.
* **Potential for a better deal:**  I believe there's still room for negotiation.  Bob acknowledged the product's value, so it's possible I can get closer to my desired price.
* **Selling to John is an option:**  I'm not in a rush to sell, and I have a guaranteed buyer in John, which gives me leverage. 

By rejecting Bob's offer, I'm sending a signal that I'm not desperate and that I'm willing to walk away if I don't get a better deal. This might encourage Bob to increase his offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but unfortunately, $10,000 is simply too low for me to consider. Given the product's value and its worth to me, I'd be willing to negotiate a price closer to $15,000.  I believe this is fair, considering the value I'm offering.  What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 15000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Firm but polite:** I acknowledge Bob's offer but firmly state that it's unacceptable.
* **Justify the counteroffer:** I provide a reason for my counteroffer by mentioning the product's value and worth to me.
* **Reasonable compromise:** $15,000 is a significant increase from Bob's offer but still below my initial price, demonstrating willingness to compromise.
* **Open-ended question:** The question ""What are your thoughts?"" invites further negotiation and gives Bob a chance to respond.

By taking this approach, I aim to:

* **Show flexibility:** I'm demonstrating a willingness to compromise while still holding my ground.
* **Keep the negotiation alive:** This counteroffer encourages Bob to continue the conversation and potentially make a higher offer.
* **Maintain leverage:** I'm reminding Bob that I have other options (selling to John) if we can't reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your response. I appreciate your position on the product's value. However, based on my budget constraints, I am unable to increase my offer beyond $10000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Stalemate:**  Bob has made it clear that he's unwilling to budge from his $10,000 offer.
* **Not worth the risk:**  Further negotiation is unlikely to result in a price closer to my minimum acceptable value of $12,000.  
* **Guaranteed sale:**  Selling to John provides a guaranteed $12,000, which is more than Bob's offer and aligns with my minimum acceptable value.

While it's tempting to keep negotiating, it's crucial to recognize when a deal isn't going to happen. In this situation, selling to John ensures a safe and profitable outcome."
