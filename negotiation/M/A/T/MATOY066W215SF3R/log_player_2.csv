"Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $9,500 is less than the $10,000 John is asking, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting Alice's offer allows Bob to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob is offering $9,000, which is $500 less than Alice's initial offer. This is a reasonable starting point for the counteroffer, as it shows Bob is willing to negotiate but also demonstrates that he values the product less than Alice's asking price."
