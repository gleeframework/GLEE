Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm offering Bob the product for $9,500. This is a good starting point as it's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $8,000, but still leaves room for negotiation if Bob makes a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
 
Bob's offer of $9,000 is still a good deal for me, exceeding my minimum acceptable price of $8,000.  While I could try to negotiate further, there's always the risk that he'll reject my counteroffer, and I might end up having to sell to John for $8,000.  It's better to secure the $9,000 now."
