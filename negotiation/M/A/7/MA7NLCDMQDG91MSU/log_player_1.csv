"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me.  I'm interested, but I'd be more comfortable with a price closer to $850,000.  What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

I'm not satisfied with Bob's offer and believe I can get closer to my desired price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $850,000 is a bit lower than I'd hoped, I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This price still offers a good value for you, and I'm confident it's a fair deal. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  How about we split the difference and settle at $925,000?  That feels like a fair compromise to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a higher price,  $925,000 is a good compromise. It's significantly higher than John's offer and allows me to close the deal before running out of rounds."
