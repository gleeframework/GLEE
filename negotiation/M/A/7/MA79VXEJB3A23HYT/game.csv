"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to invest in this valuable asset. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900,000.",900000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $700,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering its value to me and your own desire to sell. Let's work together to find a mutually beneficial solution.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $850,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price. However, $850,000 is still a bit higher than what I can realistically pay. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $800,000? This would be a fair price that allows us to both walk away satisfied. ",800000.0,Bob,4,
