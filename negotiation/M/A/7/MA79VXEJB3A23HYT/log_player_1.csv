Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $700,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering its value to me and your own desire to sell. Let's work together to find a mutually beneficial solution.
