,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, how about $105?  Let's find a price that works for both of us.",105.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I'm glad we're getting closer.  How about we meet in the middle at $97?",97.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  $97 is getting closer, but I'm still hoping we can find a price that's a bit more fair for me.  Would you consider $100?  That's still a great deal for a product you value at that price, and it's getting me closer to my target.  Let's make this work!",100.0,Alice,5,
