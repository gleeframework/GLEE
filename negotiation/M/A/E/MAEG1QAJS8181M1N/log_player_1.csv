Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its immense value, I'm proposing a price of $2,000,000.  I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and potential. What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:**  Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, I want to start high to explore if Bob is willing to pay a premium. 
* **Justification:** The message subtly emphasizes the ""immense value"" to justify the high price without revealing my bottom line.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone remains conversational (""What are your thoughts?"") indicating I'm open to discussing the price further if Bob pushes back.

This strategy aims to maximize potential profit while acknowledging the risk that Bob might reject the offer."
