"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am delighted to present you with our premium product, which is valued at $12,000 by you. I am offering this exceptional item to you at a special price of $10,000. This is an opportunity not to be missed, as it represents a significant saving compared to its market value. I am confident that you will find the product to be of great value and meet all your expectations. Should you have any questions or wish to proceed with the purchase, please let me know. Looking forward to your positive response. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is trying to inflate the perceived value of the product by claiming you value it at $12,000. You know you can get it for $12,000 from John, but you believe it's worth less.  By rejecting her offer, you open the door for a potential counter-offer closer to her actual valuation of $8,000."
