"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her actual valuation, it's still higher than your maximum budget.  It's worth attempting to negotiate further to see if you can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial price.  It's a bold move, but it's necessary to signal that I'm serious about getting the product within my budget. I'm aiming for a price closer to my maximum, but I'm leaving room for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $1,250,000, which is only $50,000 over my maximum budget. At this point, it's a good deal, especially considering I might not be able to get a better price in future rounds.  It's also worth considering that rejecting this offer and continuing to negotiate could potentially risk Alice changing her mind and deciding to sell to someone else."
