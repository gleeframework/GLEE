"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $150. I believe it's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. What do you think?",150.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $100 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price. How about $130?  This is a fair compromise that gives us both a good deal.",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but $130 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer of $100. How about $115? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",115.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $115 is still a little below what I'm comfortable with. To be fair to both of us, how about $125? It's a good compromise that gives us both a decent price. What do you think?",125.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but $125 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up a bit from my previous offer of $115, but I'm thinking more along the lines of $120. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",120.0,Bob,6,
