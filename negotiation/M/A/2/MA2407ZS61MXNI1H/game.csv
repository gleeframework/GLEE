"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but that's a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm working with a tighter budget. How about we meet in the middle at $12,000?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $12,000 is a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. However, considering the product's value to you, I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $14,000. I'm confident it's a fair price that balances both our interests. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  How about we settle at $13,000? That's a fair compromise.",13000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm glad we're close to a deal, Bob! However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go as low as $13,000. I'm willing to make one more compromise, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair price. How about we meet at $14,500? It's a slight increase from your last offer, but I believe it's a reasonable price considering the product's value to you.",14500.0,Alice,5,
