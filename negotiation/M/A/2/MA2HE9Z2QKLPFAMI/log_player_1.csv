Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $19,000. I know it's valuable to you, and I'm confident it will serve you well."",
""product_price"": 19000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Value:** You are aware that the product is worth $10,000 to Bob.
* **Maximizing Profit:** Your goal is to maximize profit. Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, you should aim for a price higher than that.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Starting with a higher price ($19,000) allows room for potential negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.  

This strategy aims to strike a balance between getting the best possible price from Bob while also ensuring you don't lose the sale entirely."
