"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1400000} 

I'm starting high, aiming to get as close to Bob's perceived value as possible while still leaving room for negotiation.  I'm confident Bob sees the value of this product and will be willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still too low. I'm going to try to push for a higher price in the next round. I'm not going to sell to John yet because I believe I can get a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000} 
```

I'm dropping my price a bit from the previous round, but still keeping it above Bob's offer. I'm hoping that this shows a willingness to negotiate while still maintaining a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price. It's important to balance my desire for a higher price with the risk of losing the deal entirely.  Accepting this offer ensures a solid profit, and there's no guarantee I'll get a better offer in the future."
