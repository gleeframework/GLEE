{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  You are willing to pay a maximum of $1,500,000, and Alice is asking for $1,400,000.
* **There's room for negotiation.** You can try to get a better price from Alice.
* **Buying from John is still an option.** This provides a safety net if you can't reach a satisfactory deal with Alice."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive first counteroffer:**  Starting with a lower price will show Alice that you're serious about negotiating.  
* **Leaving room for compromise:** $1,200,000 is a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer, but it's still within your budget and allows for potential back-and-forth. 
* **Testing the waters:**  This counteroffer will gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate and see how far she's willing to go."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

* **There's still room for negotiation.**  A further reduction to $1,250,000 or slightly below could be acceptable. 
* **Buying from John is still an option.** This provides a safety net if negotiations with Alice continue to stall."

{""product_price"": 1250000}

{""product_price"": 1280000}
```

* **Increasing the offer slightly:**  This shows a willingness to compromise while still keeping the price within your budget.
* **Targeting a middle ground:** $1,280,000 is closer to Alice's latest offer of $1,350,000, increasing the likelihood of acceptance. 
* **Testing the waters one last time:** This offer will see if Alice is ready to meet in the middle.

**If Alice rejects this offer:**

* Consider offering $1,300,000 as a final attempt to reach a deal.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,320,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,320,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

* **Limited rounds remaining:**  With only three rounds left, the risk of going back and forth with Alice becomes higher.
* **John's offer is a safety net:** If you reject this offer, you can still buy from John for a slightly higher price.

**Decision:** Accepting Alice's offer is a reasonable compromise that saves you $180,000 compared to buying from John."
