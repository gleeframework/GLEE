Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. This price still reflects the value of the product for both of us. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you coming up on your offer. However, $1,075,000 is still below my minimum.  I'm willing to go down to $1,100,000, which is a fair compromise given the value of this product. I'm sure we can find a solution that benefits both of us.

Alice is holding firm at $1,100,000 and has rejected our attempts to go lower.  It's unlikely she'll go much lower, and we're running out of rounds.  Accepting this offer gets us the product for less than John's price."
