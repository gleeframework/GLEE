"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. As we discuss the price, I want to start with a competitive offer of $1,000,000. I'm confident that this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is above my budget. I'm very interested in the product and believe it has great potential for my business, but I'm only willing to pay $850,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value to me while still leaving you some room for profit.  Let's see if we can find a way to make this work.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm proposing a new offer of $950,000. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's worth to me, while also acknowledging your budget constraints. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $950,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm confident that this product is valuable, but I'm sticking to my initial offer of $850,000. This is a fair price that allows for both of us to benefit from the deal. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that you're sticking to your initial offer, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to sell the product at $850,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to be closer to my target price. I'm proposing a new offer of $900,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value to me, while also acknowledging your budget constraints. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",900000.0,Alice,5,
