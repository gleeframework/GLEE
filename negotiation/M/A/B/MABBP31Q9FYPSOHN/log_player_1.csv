Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I think you'd really love! I'm offering it to you for $100. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's a bit higher than my minimum, hoping to get a good deal.  I'm also being friendly and engaging to build rapport with Bob.  Let's see what he says!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the product, but I was hoping for a lower price. Would you consider selling it for $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is close to my minimum, and I'm eager to sell the product. It's better to take the $90 now than risk further negotiation and potentially end up selling to John for $80."
