"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $950,000 is a bit too high for me. How about we start at $700,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While Bob's offer is tempting, it's too low for me. I'm aiming for a price closer to my initial offer, and I believe there's still room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest but $700,000 is simply too low. Let's split the difference - I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This price still allows me a fair profit while giving you a great deal. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me a bit closer.  While $850,000 is closer, it's still a touch higher than I'd like.  Would you consider $760,000?  That would make this purchase more palatable for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $760,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $760,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

While $760,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a better price. I believe there's still room for negotiation with Bob."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, let's try to meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $800,000. This is a fair price for both of us and allows us to close this deal quickly. I'm confident you'll be happy with this purchase."", ""product_price"": 800000}
