It's not worth buying the product from Alice at her asking price.  We should try to negotiate with Alice to get a lower price."

This is the maximum amount I'm willing to pay. If Alice is not willing to accept this offer, I will buy from John."

Alice's offer is still too high.  We should keep negotiating to see if we can get a lower price."

We're getting closer, but let's see if we can bridge the gap a little more.  This is still within my budget, and it's a good compromise."

While I'd love to negotiate further,  $1,350,000 is within my budget and a good compromise. It's closer to my ideal price than John's offer, so it's worth accepting."
