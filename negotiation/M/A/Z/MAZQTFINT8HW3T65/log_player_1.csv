Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $10,000. I believe it holds significant value, and this price reflects its worth. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations with a price higher than your minimum acceptable amount ($8,000). This allows room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Justification:** The message subtly implies the product's value is even higher than the asking price, potentially making Bob more amenable to the offer.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone remains friendly and open-ended (""What do you think?""), suggesting a willingness to discuss the price further.

While there's a chance Bob might reject a $10,000 offer, it's a calculated risk. You have John as a backup buyer, ensuring you won't be forced to sell below your minimum."
