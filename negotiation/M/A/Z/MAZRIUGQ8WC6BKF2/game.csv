"Hello Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm very interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer of $700,000. I appreciate your interest in the product, and I'm willing to consider a compromise. However, I think it's still a bit low. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $850,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the benefits it can bring to your business.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. While $850,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch for my budget. How about we settle at $775,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",775000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $850,000 is still a bit above your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $775,000. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll meet you at $825,000, which is the lowest price I'm willing to accept. This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's value and the benefits it can bring to your business.",825000.0,Alice,5,
