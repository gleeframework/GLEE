Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $65 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $90. This still leaves some room for negotiation, and it's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.

You have three options:

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $75 is still a bit low for me. Let's split the difference â€“ how about $85? It's a fair price for both of us, and we can finally close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:** 

While Alice's offer of $85 is getting closer to our acceptable range, we still have room to negotiate and try to get closer to John's price of $80. We'll try one more time to see if Alice is willing to go lower."
