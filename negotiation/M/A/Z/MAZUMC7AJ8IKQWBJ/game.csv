"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $110 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $65?",65.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $65 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $90. This still leaves some room for negotiation, and it's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",90.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. How about we meet in the middle at $75?",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $75 is still a bit low for me. Let's split the difference â€“ how about $85? It's a fair price for both of us, and we can finally close this deal.",85.0,Alice,5,
