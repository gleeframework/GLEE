"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $110. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum value, aiming to leave room for negotiation. I'm confident in the value of the product, so I'm not afraid to start high. I'm also being friendly and positive to build rapport with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $110 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $65? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $65. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $65
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's far below my minimum value. I'm confident in the product's worth and believe I can negotiate a better price. I'll reject his offer and try to get closer to my desired price range in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $65 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $90. This still leaves some room for negotiation, and it's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. How about we meet in the middle at $75? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $75 is closer to my minimum value, it's still below what I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob, hoping to secure a higher price. I believe there's still room for a mutually beneficial agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $75 is still a bit low for me. Let's split the difference â€“ how about $85? It's a fair price for both of us, and we can finally close this deal."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm really trying to make this work, but I have a hard limit on my budget. Would you be willing to do $80? That's the best I can offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While $80 is my absolute minimum,  I need to be realistic.  Bob has clearly stated his limit, and it's unlikely he'll budge further.  Accepting his offer allows me to finalize the deal and avoid the risk of losing the sale altogether.  This also prevents me from losing time and potentially getting a lower offer from John."
