"Alice, your product looks great, but $950,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it, which is still a good deal for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement here.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer and see your enthusiasm for the product. While $850,000 is a good starting point, I need to recoup more of my initial investment. I'm willing to come down to $900,000, which is still a fair price considering the value it brings.  Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $900,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm firm on my offer of $850,000.  This price is fair for both of us, and allows me to make the purchase within my budget. Let's close this deal.",850000.0,Bob,4,
