Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

I'm offering the product to Bob for $100. This is a good starting point, as it leaves room for negotiation while still being above my minimum acceptable price of $80.  I'm confident that Bob will be willing to pay at least this amount since the product is worth $120 to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer of $90 is still higher than my minimum acceptable price of $80 and  is a good deal considering he initially rejected my offer of $100. Accepting his offer ensures a quick and profitable sale."
