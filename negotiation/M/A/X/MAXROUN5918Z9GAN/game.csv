"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $700,000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to be flexible. I can consider a price of $850,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's still a great deal for you considering the product's value to you.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, Bob. However, I'm still a bit away from being comfortable with the price. I can offer you a compromise at $825,000. This is the best I can do, and I think it's still a great deal for you considering the product's value to you.",825000.0,Alice,5,
