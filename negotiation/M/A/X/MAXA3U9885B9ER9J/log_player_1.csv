Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you first at a special price of $135. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides.  What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 135
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations a bit higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.
* **Justification:** Offering a reason for the price, even if vague, can make it seem more palatable.  
* **Gauging Interest:** This offer allows me to see how interested Bob is. If he immediately rejects it, I know I might need to come down significantly. If he counters, there's room to negotiate. 
 
**Important Note:** Since Bob values the product at $120, and I have a guaranteed sale at $120 from John, I don't want to offer it to Bob for less than that."
