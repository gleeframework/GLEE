Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $120. This leaves room for negotiation, but it's also a good starting point considering the product is worth $100 to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $95 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $100. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I won't settle for less than my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

I'm going to counter with $105. This is a compromise that's halfway between my initial offer and Bob's offer, and still slightly above my minimum acceptable price.  I'm hoping that this will be a reasonable enough offer for Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob has offered my minimum acceptable price of $100.  While I would have liked to get more, it's not worth risking further negotiation and potentially losing the sale to John. I'll accept his offer."
