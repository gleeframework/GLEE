"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000.  It's a great deal for you, as you know it's worth $15,000 to you. Let me know what you think!",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to see if we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I understand you're looking for a good deal, $9,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $10,500? That's still a great price for you considering the product's value to you.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so how about we try $10,250? I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial price.",10250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence.  $10,250 is getting closer, but I'm still not there. Let's try $10,000. It's a fair price for both of us, and allows us to close this deal. What do you say?",10000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $10,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $9,800, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me there?",9800.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal possible, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm going to go down to $9,900, which is a very fair price given the value of the product for you. I believe this is a win-win situation.  Let me know what you think.",9900.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $9,750, but that's the absolute maximum I can pay. Can you meet me there?",9750.0,Bob,8,
