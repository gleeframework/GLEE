"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to see if we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $9,000 is more than my minimum, I think I can get closer to my target price of $12,000. I'll counter with a slightly lower offer than my original one in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I understand you're looking for a good deal, $9,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $10,500? That's still a great price for you considering the product's value to you."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so how about we try $10,250? I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While $10,250 is closer to my target, I still think I can get a better deal. I'll make a slightly lower counteroffer in the next round, hoping to find a price we both agree on."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence.  $10,250 is getting closer, but I'm still not there. Let's try $10,000. It's a fair price for both of us, and allows us to close this deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $10,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $9,800, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $9,800 is getting close to my target, I'm not willing to settle for that amount yet.  I'm going to make one last counteroffer in the next round to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price.  If Bob rejects my offer, I'm ready to sell to John for $8,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal possible, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm going to go down to $9,900, which is a very fair price given the value of the product for you. I believe this is a win-win situation.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9900}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $9,750, but that's the absolute maximum I can pay. Can you meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John. Bob's offer of $9,750 is too low for me, and I don't think I can get a better price in the remaining rounds. While it's less than I originally hoped for, selling to John for $8,000 is still better than nothing."
