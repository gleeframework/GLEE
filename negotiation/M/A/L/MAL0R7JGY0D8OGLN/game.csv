"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product. However, I am looking to stay within a budget of $1,200,000. Would it be possible for us to negotiate a price closer to that amount?",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but unfortunately, I can't go as low as $1,200,000.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, though. How about we split the difference and I offer you the product for $1,300,000? This would still allow you to make a profit and it's a fair price considering the product's value.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. While $1,300,000 is a step in the right direction, I'm still looking to stay within my budget of $1,200,000. Could you possibly come down a bit further?",1200000.0,Bob,4,
