"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a valuable piece, and I believe this price reflects its worth. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($1,000,000) and higher than Bob's perceived value ($800,000). This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Message:** I'm keeping the message friendly and direct, emphasizing the value of the product.  

**Strategy:**

* I want to start high and see if Bob is willing to negotiate. 
* If Bob rejects, I'll be prepared to counteroffer based on his response, but I'll also be watching the clock and considering selling to John if the negotiations stall."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I think it's a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. I believe this price is fair considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Rejecting Bob's offer:** $900,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. 
* **Reasoning:**  I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm not going to sell below my minimum.  There's still room to find a price that works for both of us.

**Next Steps:**

I will counteroffer Bob in the next round, aiming for a price closer to my desired range. I will also be mindful of the time remaining and the possibility of selling to John if negotiations with Bob become too difficult."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but I need to make a bit more to make this deal worthwhile. I'm willing to drop my price to $1,100,000.

```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm dropping the price by $100,000, but it's still above my minimum and above Bob's offer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate, but not at a price that undervalues my product.
* **Message:**  I'm reaffirming the value of the product and acknowledging Bob's perspective while emphasizing that $1,100,000 is a reasonable compromise.

**Strategy:**

* I'm trying to find a middle ground that benefits both of us.  
* I'm also keeping the time constraint in mind and will be prepared to walk away if Bob doesn't show more flexibility."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting closer.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1,025,000. This is a significant drop from my initial price, and it's just above my minimum. Let's see if we can finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 1025000}
```

**Explanation:**

**Strategy:**

* I'm trying to make a final push to secure a deal with Bob.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $975,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the value it brings to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Selling to John:**  While Bob has increased his offer to $975,000, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. With only four rounds remaining, the time constraint is a major factor. I'm not confident that we'll be able to reach an agreement with Bob in the remaining time.

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Pressure:** I'm running out of time. It's more likely that I won't be able to reach a higher price with Bob in the remaining rounds.
* **Guaranteed Price:**  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000, which is a secure outcome.
* **Negotiating Fatigue:**  The negotiations with Bob have been lengthy and are becoming less productive.

**Conclusion:**

Considering the time constraint and the risk of not reaching a higher price with Bob, selling to John is the most sensible decision at this point."
