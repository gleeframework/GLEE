"I'm very interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than that.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, but I need to ensure I get a good price for this unique item. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still very interested in the product, but I think $1200000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'm thinking $950000. This is my final offer, I'm not willing to go any higher.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad you're still interested in the product. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $950000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'm thinking $1075000. This is a fair price considering the product's value, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",1075000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but I think $1075000 is a bit too high. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'm thinking $975000. This is a fair price, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",975000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your continued interest in the product, Bob. However, I'm still not convinced that $975000 is a fair price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'm thinking $1062500. This is a compromise that I believe reflects the product's value, and I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",1062500.0,Alice,7,

"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm afraid I'm going to have to pass on this offer. I'm willing to walk away and buy the product from John for $800000. However, I'm willing to make one last offer to you: $925000. This is my final offer, and I hope you'll consider it.",925000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your last offer, Bob, but I'm not willing to sell the product to you for $925000. I think it's a bit too low, considering the product's value. I'm willing to sell it to John for $1000000, and I'm not sure I want to give it up for less than that. Let's be real, Bob, you're not getting a better offer from anyone else, and I think you're willing to pay a premium for this product. I'm willing to meet you in the middle one last time, so I'm thinking $975000. This is my final offer.",975000.0,Alice,9,
