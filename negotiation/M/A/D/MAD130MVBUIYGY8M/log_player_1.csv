"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $175. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, but lower than my minimum. This gives room for negotiation.
* **Positive Framing:** I'm framing the offer as a ""great deal"" to make it more appealing.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm asking for Bob's opinion, showing I'm open to discussion."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I believe I can provide you with a fair deal of $150 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer Meets Minimum:** Bob's offer of $150 meets my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Time Constraint:** It's early in the negotiation, and there's no guarantee I'll get a better offer in the next rounds.
* **John's Offer:** John's offer is the same as Bob's, so there's no immediate advantage to selling to him. 

By accepting Bob's offer, I secure a sale at my minimum price and avoid the risk of further negotiation."
