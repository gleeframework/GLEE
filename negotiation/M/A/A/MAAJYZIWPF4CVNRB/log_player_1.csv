Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value, I'm proposing a starting price of $14,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,000. I'm willing to pay that price, but I think it's a bit steep for me. Can we meet in the middle at $9,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","Bob's offer is significantly below my minimum. While I want to find a price that works for both of us, going as low as $8,000 isn't feasible for me.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer. I appreciate you coming back with a number.  While I understand your perspective, $8,000 undervalues the product significantly. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I can't go as low as $9,000. How about we meet in the middle at $12,000?"", ""product_price"": 12000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down from $14,000 to $12,000, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $9,500. This is the highest I'm willing to go, and I hope we can meet at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","This is getting close to a point where I need to cut my losses. Bob is firm at $9,500, and while another round *might* get me a bit more, it's risky.
