"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value, I'm proposing a starting price of $14,000. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,000. I'm willing to pay that price, but I think it's a bit steep for me. Can we meet in the middle at $9,000?",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your offer. I appreciate you coming back with a number.  While I understand your perspective, $8,000 undervalues the product significantly. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I can't go as low as $9,000. How about we meet in the middle at $12,000?",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down from $14,000 to $12,000, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $9,500. This is the highest I'm willing to go, and I hope we can meet at this price.",9500.0,Bob,4,
