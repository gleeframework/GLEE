"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to sell the product. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the price of $1,100,000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $950,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your budgetary considerations, but $950,000 is a bit too low for me to consider at this point.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,050,000. I believe this price reflects the true value of the product and offers a fair deal for both of us. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your response, Alice. I've carefully considered your latest offer and while I appreciate your flexibility, I'm still not able to meet the price of $1,050,000. I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $1,000,000. I hope this revised proposal allows us to reach an agreement.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
