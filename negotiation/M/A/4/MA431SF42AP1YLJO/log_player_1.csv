"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer starts high, but it's still within the realm of possibility for Bob to make a profit. This strategy aims to:

* **Set a high starting point:** This gives me room to negotiate downwards.
* **Leave room for counteroffers:**  I want Bob to feel like he can get a better deal, incentivizing him to engage in the negotiation process.
* **Show confidence in the product's value:** Starting high demonstrates my belief in the product's worth.

It's crucial to remember that I can always choose to sell to John for $1,000,000 if Bob's counteroffers aren't satisfactory."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,200,000 is too high for me.  I'd be willing to pay $600,000 for the product.  I believe that's a fair price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. Accepting his offer would result in a huge financial loss for me. While selling to John for $1,000,000 is tempting, I still have 8 rounds to negotiate with Bob. It's possible to reach a mutually acceptable price, and I can potentially make even more than $1,000,000 if I play my cards right."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $600,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to compromise, but I can't go below $900,000.  This still leaves you room for profit, and it's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

This counteroffer:

* **Shows willingness to compromise:**  I'm lowering my price from the previous round, demonstrating flexibility. 
* **Maintains a firm stance:**  $900,000 is still within my acceptable range and represents a significant profit for me. 
* **Appeals to fairness:** I'm suggesting that $900,000 is a fair price, given the product's value and Bob's potential profit margin.

I'm hopeful that Bob will see the value in continuing negotiations and be willing to meet me somewhere in the middle. However, if he doesn't, I'm prepared to consider selling to John in the next round if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're looking for a fair price. How about we settle at $700,000? That's a significant increase from my previous offer and puts us closer to a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $700,000 is a significant increase from Bob's previous offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  I'm still hopeful that we can reach a more favorable deal. I have 6 rounds remaining and will continue to negotiate with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $700,000 is still a bit too low for me. How about we meet halfway at $850,000?  This would allow both of us to walk away happy and with a good deal. Let's make it happen!"", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

This counteroffer:

* **Further shows willingness to compromise:** I'm continuing to lower my price, demonstrating flexibility.
* **Creates urgency:**  I'm suggesting a ""meet halfway"" solution, adding a sense of finality to the negotiation.
* **Highlights potential win-win:** I'm emphasizing that $850,000 would be a good deal for both of us.

I'm hoping this counteroffer will finally push Bob towards a deal closer to my desired range. If he rejects again, I'll have to seriously consider selling to John in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer.  I appreciate you working with me. To be honest with you, my budget is $800,000. How about we settle for that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $800,000 is my minimum acceptable price.  However, with only 4 rounds remaining, I need to make a decision.  While I could continue negotiating, there's a chance Bob will refuse to budge further.  Selling to John for $1,000,000 guarantees a profit and avoids the risk of losing out on a deal altogether.  It's time to lock in a sure win."
