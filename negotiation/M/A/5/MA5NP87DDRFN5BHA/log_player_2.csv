"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this exceptional product for a very attractive price of $1700000.  I understand this is a significant investment, but I believe the value it holds for you will far outweigh the cost.  Consider it a strategic move for your business.  However, if this price doesn't align with your budget, I have another buyer ready to acquire it at a higher price.  Let me know your decision at your earliest convenience. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000.
