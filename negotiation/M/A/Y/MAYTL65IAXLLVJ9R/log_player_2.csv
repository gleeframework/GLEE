"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I'm starting the negotiations at $950,000.  I think it's a fair starting point considering what you stand to gain. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is too high.  Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $950,000 is a bit too steep for me. Given my understanding of the product's value, I'm willing to offer $850,000. I believe this price is fair, considering your potential profit and the value I see in the product."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you taking the time to consider my offer and providing yours.  While $850,000 is certainly a respectable figure, I believe the true value of this product sits significantly higher.  To move things along, I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, it's still too high for Bob.  There's room for further negotiation, and Bob can still potentially get a better deal by making another counteroffer. It's risky, but Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $900,000 is still higher than I'm comfortable with.  Given the value we've both discussed, I'm offering $875,000. I believe this price reflects a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement at this level."", ""product_price"": 875000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for the best possible deal, and I respect that. I've tried to be flexible, but I need to be mindful of the product's true worth.  Let's split the difference - $887,500.  This reflects my absolute bottom line, and I believe it's a fair offer that benefits both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $887,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $887,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

At this point, Bob has two options:

1. **Accept Alice's offer:** This nets him a decent deal at $887,500, which is still below his maximum budget of $1,000,000.
2. **Reject and counteroffer:** While Bob might be able to get a slightly lower price, there's a risk that Alice will walk away from the deal, leaving him with the option of buying from John at a higher price.

Considering the risk of losing the deal and the limited time left, accepting Alice's offer is the more prudent option. It secures a good deal within Bob's budget and avoids the possibility of ending up with a worse outcome."
