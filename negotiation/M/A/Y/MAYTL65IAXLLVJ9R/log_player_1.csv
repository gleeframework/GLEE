Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $950,000 is a bit too steep for me. Given my understanding of the product's value, I'm willing to offer $850,000. I believe this price is fair, considering your potential profit and the value I see in the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

While $850,000 is certainly a respectable figure, I believe the true value of this product sits significantly higher.  To move things along, I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This is my final offer."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $900,000 is still higher than I'm comfortable with.  Given the value we've both discussed, I'm offering $875,000. I believe this price reflects a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement at this level. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000

**Reasoning:** We're getting close, but Bob is moving slowly.  I'm willing to risk one more counteroffer to try and hold a price above $875,000."
