"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000} 
```

I'm going to start by offering the product at my minimum acceptable price, $1,200,000. This is the price I would get from John, so it's a good starting point. It's unlikely Bob will accept this immediately, but it sets the stage for negotiation and lets him know I'm serious about maximizing my profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. It's tempting to take it, as $950,000 is still a large sum, but I'm committed to earning as much as I can for this product. I'll reject his offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $1,100,000. This is a significant drop from my initial offer, but it's still above Bob's offer and closer to my minimum acceptable price. It shows flexibility while leaving room for further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low. I'm not willing to compromise that much, even though we're already halfway through the rounds. I'll reject his offer and see if I can get a higher counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $1,050,000. This is a further compromise, but it's still above Bob's last offer and closer to the value he places on the product. I'm hoping this will be enough to convince him to come closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $980,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While his offer is getting closer to my desired price, it's still too low. I believe I can still get a better deal by continuing the negotiation. We have four rounds left, so there's still time to try and reach a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1025000} 
```

I'm going to counteroffer with $1,025,000.  It's a slight increase from my previous offer, but still within a range I'm comfortable with. I'm hoping this will be enough to finally push Bob towards a deal, especially since we're getting close to the end of the negotiation rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $985,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $985,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I've been negotiating with Bob for a while now, and it's clear that he's not willing to pay a price close to what the product is worth to me. With only two rounds left, the risk of not reaching an agreement with Bob is too high. I'd rather secure a sale with John for $1,200,000, which is my minimum acceptable price.  While I would have liked to get more, guaranteeing the deal is more important at this point."
