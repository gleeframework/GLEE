Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested buyers."", 
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we know John will buy the product for $1,000,000, Bob values it much higher at $1,500,000. Our goal is to get as close to that $1,500,000 as possible.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $1,350,000 leaves a significant profit margin for Bob ($150,000) while still securing a substantial profit for us ($350,000 over our minimum).
* **Urgency and Scarth:** By mentioning other interested buyers and presenting a limited-time offer, we create a sense of urgency, potentially encouraging Bob to accept the offer quickly."
