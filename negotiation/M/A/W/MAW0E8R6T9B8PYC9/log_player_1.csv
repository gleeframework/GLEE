Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price of $100, which is higher than Bob's valuation but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive framing:** I'm framing the offer as a ""great deal"" for Bob, making it more appealing.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  I'm not setting a hardline price, leaving the door open for Bob to counteroffer.
* **Keeping John in mind:** While $100 is less than my minimum acceptable price of $120, it's a good starting point.  If Bob doesn't accept, I can always fall back on John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. It's a bit higher than what I'm comfortable paying. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:**  $90 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $120.
* **Opportunity for a better deal:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I can potentially get closer to my target price by making a counteroffer.
* **John's offer is a safety net:** If negotiations with Bob fall through, I can always sell to John for $120."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $90 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $95? That way we can both be happy with the outcome."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving closer to Bob's offer:**  I'm increasing my offer to $95, which is closer to Bob's counteroffer of $90. 
* **Framing it positively:**  I'm emphasizing that we can both be ""happy"" with the outcome, suggesting a win-win situation.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  While $95 is closer to my minimum, I'm still leaving some room for Bob to counteroffer if he wants. 
* **Keeping John in mind:**  While $95 is still less than my minimum, it's a better price than Bob's counteroffer and puts me closer to John's offer of $120."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $85, but I'm not sure I can stretch any further. Would you be willing to meet me at $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $85 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $120.
* **Limited potential for improvement:**  There is a small chance Bob will offer a higher price in the next round, but it's unlikely he'll get much closer to my desired price.
* **John's offer is a guaranteed profit:** Selling to John for $120 guarantees me a profit, and avoids any further negotiation with Bob. 

It's better to take the guaranteed profit from John than risk further negotiation with Bob that is likely to result in a lower price."
