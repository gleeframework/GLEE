"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I can get out of the product. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $900000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1100000. This is a compromise that still benefits both of us, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $950000. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer: I'll sell the product to you for $1050000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
