Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on this product. I think it would be perfect for you.  I'm willing to part with it for $18,000. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 18000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $12,000, you should aim higher with Bob. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $18,000 leaves space for potential negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, and you can gradually decrease the price if needed.  
* **Gauge Bob's Interest:**  A higher initial offer helps you understand how interested Bob is. If he flat-out rejects it, you haven't lost anything, as you can always go to John."
