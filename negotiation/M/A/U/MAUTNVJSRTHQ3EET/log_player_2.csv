Bob should reject Alice's offer. It's significantly higher than his maximum budget, and he can likely get a better deal by negotiating with Alice or buying from John."

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's closer to his budget, it's still above his ideal price point. He should continue negotiating and see if he can get Alice to drop the price further."

Bob should buy the product from John.  While Alice is getting closer to Bob's desired price, she's still above his limit. John offers the product at Bob's ideal price, making him the better option."
