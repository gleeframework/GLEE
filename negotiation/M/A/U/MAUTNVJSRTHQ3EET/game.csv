"Alice,  $18000 is a bit above my budget. I'm really interested in this product, but I'm only able to offer $13000 right now.  What do you think?",13000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that 13000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet in the middle at 16000?",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to compromise.  $16000 is still a bit high for me. How about we split the difference and go with $15500? This would be a fair price for both of us.",15500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go all the way down to 15500. How about we meet at 16250? It's still a great deal for you, and I'm willing to make a slight concession to get the deal done.",16250.0,Alice,5,
