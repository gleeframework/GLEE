"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject the offer.  He can get the product for $1,000,000 from John, so there's no reason to accept Alice's offer at $1,200,000. 

This is the first round, and Bob has time to negotiate with Alice and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob knows he can get the product for $1,000,000 from John, so that's the counteroffer he makes to Alice.  It's the lowest he's willing to go, and there's a good chance Alice will accept it rather than risk losing the sale entirely to John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is still too high. Bob can get the product from John for $1,000,000, so there's no reason to accept $1,250,000. 

Bob should continue negotiating with Alice and try to lower the price further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob has already offered the lowest price he's willing to pay ($1,000,000). To show flexibility and encourage Alice to negotiate, he's increasing his offer slightly to $1,050,000.  This is a small increase, but it shows that he's willing to compromise.  It's still below Alice's desired price of $1,250,000, so there's still room for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $1,300,000 is still too high for Bob.  He can get the product from John for $1,000,000. Bob should continue to negotiate with Alice and try to lower the price further.  He still has five rounds left and might be able to get a better deal with a little more bargaining."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is increasing his offer again, this time to $1,100,000. This shows that he is still willing to negotiate, but it's also a significant increase from his last offer.  He's getting closer to Alice's desired price, and with only four rounds left, he needs to show that he's serious about reaching an agreement. He's hoping that this counteroffer will convince Alice to accept, but if not, he can still fall back on buying from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is still too high for Bob. While he's getting closer to an agreement, he can still buy the product from John for a lower price. With only three rounds left, he should continue to negotiate with Alice to see if he can get a better deal. There's still time to potentially reach a price closer to his target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is continuing to increase his offer, but he is still below Alice's desired price of $1,350,000. With only two rounds left, he needs to show that he's serious about reaching an agreement, but he also doesn't want to give up too much. This counteroffer demonstrates a willingness to compromise, while still keeping his maximum price below what he's willing to pay to John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

This is the final round. Alice's offer of $1,400,000 is still too high for Bob. He can get the product from John for $1,000,000, which is significantly less. There's no point in continuing to negotiate with Alice.  

It's better to secure the product from John at a lower price than risk getting stuck with a higher price in the final round with Alice."
