"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to own this incredible product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,600,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and the benefits it will bring you.",1600000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate the offer, it's higher than I can currently afford.  I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product, which I believe is a fair price considering its value to me. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. However, the value of this product extends far beyond the $1,000,000 mark. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000. This offer reflects my desire to make a deal while ensuring a fair price for both of us.",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,400,000 is still outside my price range.  I'm prepared to offer $1,100,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. This price reflects the value I see in the product, while also staying within my budget.  Let's find a compromise.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you moving closer to a feasible agreement. To bridge the remaining gap, I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000. This reflects a considerable compromise on my end and demonstrates my commitment to getting this deal done.",1300000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer, but $1,300,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,150,000, which demonstrates my commitment to this deal.  Let's find common ground and make this happen.",1150000.0,Bob,6,
