"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than I'm aiming for. Would you be willing to come down to $1,050,000? I believe this would be a fair price for both of us.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that the product's value is higher. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,075,000. This is a one-time offer, so I hope you'll consider it seriously.",1075000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1,075,000 is still a bit higher than I can go right now. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $1,025,000?  This would be a great deal for me and I'm sure you'd still be happy with the sale.",1025000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your desire to find a price that works for both of us. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $1,025,000. I'm willing to make another concession and offer it to you for $1,062,500. This is my final offer, so I hope you'll consider it seriously.",1062500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,062,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. How about we split the difference and settle on $1,043,750?  This would be a great deal for me, and I believe it would still be a profitable sale for you. ",1043750.0,Bob,6,
