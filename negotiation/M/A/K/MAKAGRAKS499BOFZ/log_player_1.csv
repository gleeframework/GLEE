Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1500000} 

This is a high starting price, reflecting the product's value to me.  It gives me room to negotiate downwards if Bob counters, while also maximizing my potential profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $900,000 is a significant amount, it's still far below what the product is worth to me.  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to counter with a price closer to my initial offer and hopefully find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000} 
```

This counteroffer is a compromise, coming down from my initial offer but still maintaining a price that reflects the value of the product to me.  It's a move towards Bob's offer but not a complete surrender. Hopefully, it'll be a price he finds acceptable, or we can continue to negotiate from here."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $1,050,000 is a good deal for me. While it's less than my initial asking price, it's still above the $1,000,000 I could get from John. Accepting this offer secures a decent profit and avoids the risk of further negotiations with Bob potentially lowering the price even further."
