"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, but still lower than my minimum. This gives room for negotiation.
* **Friendly Tone:**  A positive message builds rapport and encourages Bob to consider the offer.
* **Room for Negotiation:**  Leaving space for Bob to counter ensures the negotiation continues.
* **Strategic Price:**  $10,000 allows for a potential middle ground if Bob counteroffers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $9,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm not desperate to sell. I still have room to negotiate and potentially get closer to my target. 

* **Reasoning:** Bob has demonstrated a willingness to negotiate, and it's likely we can find a middle ground.
* **Strategy:** I'll counter with a slightly lower price, hoping to close the gap and encourage Bob to accept."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position. I'm willing to come down to $9,500. That's a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting Halfway (Almost):** I'm offering a price closer to Bob's counteroffer, demonstrating flexibility and a willingness to compromise.
* **Highlighting Value:**  I remind Bob of the product's value to justify my price.
* **Positive Tone:**  A friendly tone keeps the negotiation amicable. 
* **Closing the Gap:**  $9,500 is a strong position, aiming to incentivize Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Can you try to meet me at $9,000 again? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Even though Bob is persistent with his $9,000 offer, I'm still holding out for a slightly better price.  

* **Reasoning:**  I'm close to my minimum acceptable price, but I have the option of selling to John for a significantly higher amount. This gives me leverage. 
* **Strategy:** I'll counteroffer again, aiming to find a price closer to $9,500, hoping to close the gap with Bob.  If he rejects, I can consider selling to John in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're sticking to your budget.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to do $9,250. This is a fair compromise, and it's the best I can offer. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 9250}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm offering a price that's right in the middle between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer.
* **Fairness:**  I emphasize the compromise nature of the offer to make it more appealing.
* **Finality:**  I subtly suggest that this is my best price, potentially pushing Bob to accept.
* **Decision Point:** If Bob rejects this offer, I'm likely to consider selling to John in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again. Can we do $9,125? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

I've reached a point where Bob's offers are getting increasingly close to my minimum, but I'm still not completely satisfied.  However, with only 4 rounds remaining, the risk of continuing negotiations and potentially ending up with a lower price than John's offer is too high.

* **Risk Assessment:**  The potential of reaching a deal with Bob is getting smaller with each round, and time is running out.
* **Opportunity Cost:** John's offer guarantees a higher profit, and it's a safer option considering the remaining rounds.
* **Decision:** It's time to maximize my profit by selling to John."
