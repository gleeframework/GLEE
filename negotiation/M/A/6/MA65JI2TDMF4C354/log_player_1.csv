Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value ($800,000) but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Leaving room for counteroffers:**  A $900,000 offer gives Bob room to counter without feeling like he's being pushed too hard. 
* **Keeping John in mind:** If Bob rejects, I'm still comfortable moving on to John for my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the value of your product, $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $850,000.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  While $850,000 is better than his initial perceived value, it's still significantly below my minimum desired price.
* **Room for negotiation:** I can still counteroffer and potentially get closer to my goal of $900,000 or even higher. 
* **Avoiding risk:** Selling to John for $1,000,000 guarantees my minimum value, but I'm willing to take a chance to potentially get more from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite there yet.  $850,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $875,000, which I think is a fair compromise considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 875000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm showing a willingness to negotiate by coming down from my original offer, but still staying above Bob's initial counteroffer.
* **Maintain leverage:**  The counteroffer is still closer to my desired price than Bob's offer, giving me a bit of leverage in the negotiation.
* **Focus on value:**  The message emphasizes the value of the product, reminding Bob why it's worth paying a bit more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position.  How about $860,000?  That's a fair compromise, and it's closer to my budget.  Let's see if we can close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $860,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $860,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Closing the deal:** Bob's counteroffer of $860,000 is close to my counteroffer of $875,000, and it's significantly higher than his initial offer of $850,000. 
* **Minimizing risk:**  While I'd prefer to get closer to $900,000, accepting this offer means I don't have to risk further negotiation with Bob or potentially lose out on the deal altogether. 
* **Better than John's offer:**  While selling to John guarantees $1,000,000, it's a lower profit margin. Accepting Bob's offer results in a slightly lower price, but it's still a good deal considering the time and effort invested in the negotiation."
