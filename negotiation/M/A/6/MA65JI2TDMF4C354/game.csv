"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the value of your product, $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $850,000.  Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite there yet.  $850,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $875,000, which I think is a fair compromise considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",875000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position.  How about $860,000?  That's a fair compromise, and it's closer to my budget.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",860000.0,Bob,4,
