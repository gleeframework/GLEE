Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm asking for $120 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 120}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price of $120, which is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $80. This gives me room to negotiate and leaves space for Bob to make a counteroffer.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a friendly and encouraging tone to start the negotiation. This helps build rapport and makes Bob more likely to engage.
* **Value Proposition:** I mention that Bob would ""really appreciate"" the product, subtly hinting at its value to him.

This strategy aims to:

* **Maximize Potential Profit:** By starting high, I'm maximizing my potential profit while still leaving room for negotiation.
* **Encourage Counteroffer:** By not setting an extremely high price, I'm more likely to get Bob to make a counteroffer, allowing for back-and-forth negotiation.
* **Maintain Control:** By stating my initial price, I'm establishing a clear starting point for the negotiation and keeping control of the conversation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering the product. I'm interested, but I can only pay $100 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $100 is higher than John's offer of $80, I'm going to reject it and continue negotiating with Bob.  Here's why:

* **Potential for Higher Price:**  The product is worth $150 to Bob, and he's already shown interest. There's still room for negotiation, and I can likely get closer to my desired price.
* **Building Momentum:** Rejecting Bob's offer shows I'm not desperate and willing to walk away. This can strengthen my position in the negotiation. 
* **Exploring Compromise:**  By making a counteroffer, I can explore if there's a price that we can both agree on. 

I'll use the next round to counter Bob's offer with a price closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $100 is just a little too low for me. How about $110?  It's a fair price considering the value of this product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter with a Compromise:**  I'm counteroffering at $110, which is a compromise between my initial offer of $120 and Bob's offer of $100. 
* **Highlight Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value, hoping to justify my counteroffer and encourage him to agree. 
* **Positive and Engaging Tone:**  I'm keeping the tone friendly and encouraging to maintain a positive negotiating atmosphere.

This counteroffer aims to:

* **Find Common Ground:**  By moving closer to Bob's offer, I'm signaling my willingness to compromise while still pursuing a price closer to my desired target.
* **Increase the Chances of Agreement:** By offering a fair price, I'm increasing the likelihood of Bob accepting and finalizing the deal.
* **Maintain Control:** By making the counteroffer, I'm retaining control of the negotiation and demonstrating my commitment to finding a solution."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for adjusting your offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product, but I can only afford to pay $95 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $95 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price of $80, I'm going to reject it and continue negotiating with Bob. Here's why:

* **Potential for Higher Price:** I'm still closer to my desired price point of $120. I believe I can push for a price closer to $100, and potentially even higher, if I keep negotiating.
* **Stronger Position:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I show I'm not desperate to sell and I believe in the value of the product. This can strengthen my negotiating position.
* **Exploring Compromise:** I'm willing to continue exploring compromise with Bob, as I believe there's a price we can both agree on.

I'll use the next round to make a final counteroffer, aiming to reach a price that's fair to both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position.  $95 is still a bit lower than I can do, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $105?  It's a fair price, considering the value of this product. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 105}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Final Counteroffer:** This is my final counteroffer, aiming to close the deal with Bob. 
* **Compromise and Finality:**  I'm offering $105, which is the midpoint between my previous offer of $110 and Bob's offer of $95. This shows a willingness to compromise and signals that this is my final offer.
* **Positive and Encouraging Tone:**  I'm using a positive and encouraging tone to incentivize Bob to accept the offer. 

This counteroffer aims to:

* **Achieve a Fair Price:** I believe $105 is a fair price, considering the value of the product and Bob's willingness to pay.
* **Close the Deal:** This final counteroffer is intended to push Bob toward accepting the deal, avoiding further back-and-forth negotiations.
* **Maximize Profit:** While not my ideal price, $105 is still significantly better than the $80 I would get from John."
