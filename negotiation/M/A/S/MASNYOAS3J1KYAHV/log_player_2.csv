Round 2

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you offering the product, but $13,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Considering my budget and the value to me, I'd be willing to pay $11,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 11000}

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your position, but $11,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. How about we meet in the middle at $12,250? This feels like a fair price that reflects the value this product offers. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,250

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $12,250 is closer to your target, it's still above your preferred price.  You're not in a rush to buy, so rejecting and counteroffering again is the better strategy to try and secure a lower price."
