"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. I believe it's worth a significant amount, and considering its value to you, I'm proposing a starting price of $13,500. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you offering the product, but $13,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Considering my budget and the value to me, I'd be willing to pay $11,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your position, but $11,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. How about we meet in the middle at $12,250? This feels like a fair price that reflects the value this product offers.",12250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $12,250 is still a bit out of my budget.  I'm firm on $11,500. It's a fair price that benefits both of us, and I'm confident this product will be valuable to me.",11500.0,Bob,4,
