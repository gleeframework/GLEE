"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I believe this product would be a valuable asset to you. I'm initially offering it for $1,000,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, that's a bit steep for me. I'm interested, but I'd need a lower price to make it work. How about we start at $600,000?"",
""product_price"": 600000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest. While that price is too low for me to consider, I'm willing to negotiate. How about we meet halfway at $800,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

Alice is meeting your maximum price. There's no guarantee you can negotiate her down further, and waiting carries the risk she'll increase her offer."
