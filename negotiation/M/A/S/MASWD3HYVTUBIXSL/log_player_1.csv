I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  It's very close to what I was hoping for, and I don't want to risk losing the deal altogether.  It's important to me to get a good price, but it's also important to get the sale.  I'm confident that I can find another buyer who would be willing to pay my asking price if this deal falls through."
