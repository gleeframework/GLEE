"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,500,000. It's a unique opportunity to own something truly valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1500000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Initial Offer:**  I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum acceptable value of $1,200,000. This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to potentially earn more.
* **Message:** The message is friendly and inviting, highlighting the value of the product to pique Bob's interest. 
* **Strategy:**  This initial offer sets the stage for negotiation. I'm aiming to understand Bob's perceived value and gauge his willingness to pay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of your product, but I am only willing to pay $1200000 for it. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Offer:**  Bob is offering my minimum acceptable price. While this would secure a sale, it's not ideal since I'm aiming to earn more.
* **Strategy:** I'm choosing to reject Bob's offer and continue the negotiation.  I believe there's still potential to get a higher price from Bob, and I have 9 rounds remaining to explore this. 
* **Risk Assessment:** There's a risk that if I continue to reject offers, Bob will walk away, and I'll be forced to accept John's offer. However, I'm willing to take that risk to see if I can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $1,200,000 is my minimum, I'm confident the value I'm offering is higher than that.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,350,000? This would be a fair price that reflects both our interests."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm offering a price that's halfway between my initial offer and Bob's offer. This shows I'm willing to compromise while still aiming for a better price than my minimum.
* **Message:** The message is still friendly and emphasizes the value of the product, but also acknowledges Bob's initial offer. 
* **Strategy:** By offering a compromise, I'm hoping to demonstrate flexibility and encourage Bob to come closer to my desired price point. This strategy increases the chance of closing the deal while still securing a profit above my minimum acceptable value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I believe $1300000 would be a fair price for the product considering its value to me. I hope this aligns with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Offer:** Bob is offering $1,300,000, which is closer to my desired price and significantly higher than my minimum acceptable value of $1,200,000.
* **Strategy:**  I'm choosing to accept Bob's offer. Although I would prefer to sell for even more, it's a good deal, and the negotiation process is taking time. There's a risk that if I continue to reject offers, Bob will walk away, and I'll be forced to accept John's offer at a lower price. 
* **Risk Assessment:** While there's always a chance of getting a higher price, I'm prioritizing a secure sale at a profitable amount.  There are still 6 rounds left, but I don't want to risk losing this deal entirely."
