"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you this great product for $120. I know it's worth a lot to you, and this price is still a great deal. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $120 is a decent price and below your maximum budget, there's room for negotiation. Alice is clearly motivated to sell. By rejecting this offer, you might be able to get a better price from her in a subsequent round."
