"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which has been meticulously crafted to meet your needs. With its exceptional features and quality, it's truly a valuable asset. I believe you would appreciate its worth far beyond its monetary value. Considering its significance, I propose a price of $120 for you to experience all it has to offer. This is a great opportunity to enhance your experience with our product. Let me know if this offer suits your expectations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While Alice's offer is better than the $150 she values the product at, it's still more expensive than buying from John for $100.  Therefore, rejecting Alice's offer and buying from John is the most financially advantageous option."
