"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. Would you be interested in purchasing it for $14,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Even though Alice's offer is lower than what you'd pay John, it's still above your maximum budget of $15,000. You can reject her offer and still purchase the product from John, albeit at a slightly higher price."
