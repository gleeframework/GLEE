,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, but I'm looking to save some money on this purchase. Considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000, I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for it. I believe this is a fair compromise and would like to hear your thoughts.",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counter-offer, but $1,300,000 is a bit too low for me to consider.  This product has significant value, and I'm confident in its potential to generate even more than that for you. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $1,400,000?",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still looking to save some money on this purchase. Considering your initial offer was $1,500,000, and you're now proposing $1,400,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway between those two numbers. I'll offer $1,350,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise and would like to hear your thoughts.",1350000.0,Bob,4,
