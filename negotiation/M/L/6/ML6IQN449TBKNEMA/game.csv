"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this truly unique product. Given its exceptional value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations.

,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm very interested in the product, but $1,800,000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $600,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, $600,000 significantly undervalues the true worth and potential of this product.  Let's meet in the middle - how about $1,400,000?",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that the product has value, but $1,400,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $1,100,000. Can you consider that?",1100000.0,Bob,4,
