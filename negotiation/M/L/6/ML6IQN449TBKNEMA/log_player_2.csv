"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, $600,000 significantly undervalues the true worth and potential of this product.  Let's meet in the middle - how about $1,400,000?
