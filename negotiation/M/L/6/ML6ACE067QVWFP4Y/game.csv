"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm afraid I can't meet you at $9000. I'm willing to consider a compromise. How about we meet at $11000?

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make another concession. However, I'm still not willing to go below $11000. How about we meet at $11250?
