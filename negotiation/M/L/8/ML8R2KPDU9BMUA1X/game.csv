"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9500 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $10750?  That would still be a good deal for you, and it would get me closer to my target price. Let me know what you think.",10750.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you're looking to make a profit, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $9500. How about we meet in the middle at $10000? That would be a good compromise for both of us.",10000.0,Bob,4,
