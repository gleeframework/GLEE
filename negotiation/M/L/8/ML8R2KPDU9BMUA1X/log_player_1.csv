Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000.  It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  $12,000 is still a good deal for Bob since he values it at $10,000. 
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  It's not my absolute bottom line, allowing for potential counteroffers.
* **It's significantly less than my minimum:**  I'm willing to take a bit of a loss initially to secure a sale, rather than risk losing out to John. 

I'm hoping to gauge Bob's interest and see if we can reach an agreement without having to resort to counteroffers or going to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9500. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $9,500 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. I believe there's still room for negotiation, and I'm willing to try for a better price before resorting to selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $10,750?  That would still be a good deal for you, and it would get me closer to my target price. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10750}
```

Here's why I chose $10,750:

* **It's a compromise:** It's exactly halfway between my previous offer of $12,000 and Bob's offer of $9,500. This demonstrates a willingness to negotiate and find common ground.
* **It's still above Bob's value:** $10,750 is still within a reasonable range for Bob, considering he values the product at $10,000.
* **It leaves room for further negotiation:** If Bob rejects this offer, I can still adjust my price slightly without dropping below my minimum. 

I'm hopeful that this counteroffer will be more appealing to Bob and we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're looking to make a profit, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $9500. How about we meet in the middle at $10000? That would be a good compromise for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While $10,000 is still below my ideal price, it's a significant improvement over his previous offer and gets me closer to my minimum.  Considering the potential risk of further negotiations and the possibility of Bob backing out altogether, accepting this offer seems like the best strategy.  I can always try to make up for the difference by finding a better deal on my next purchase."
