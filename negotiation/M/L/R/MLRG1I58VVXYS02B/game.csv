"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $175 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $80.  What do you think?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $80 is far too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer. How about $125? This is a great price for a product that's worth a lot more. Let's make a deal!",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand that $80 is quite a bit lower than your asking price. I'm willing to meet you halfway - how about we settle for $100? That's a fair compromise.",100.0,Bob,4,
