"I appreciate the enthusiasm, but I think $1800000 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1600000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget.",1600000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm starting to think we're getting close to the minimum value I'm willing to accept. I'm willing to meet you at $1700000, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair deal. I'm not willing to go any lower than that. How about we meet at $1700000?",1700000.0,Alice,5,
