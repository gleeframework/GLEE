"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob,

I am delighted to present you with an extraordinary opportunity to acquire our flagship product, which I believe holds immense value for you, just like it does for me. This product is worth $1,500,000 to me, and I am confident it will be equally valuable to you. I am offering this exceptional item to you at a special price of $1,400,000, a significant discount that reflects my desire to see this product go to someone who will appreciate it fully.

Please let me know if you are interested in proceeding with this offer. I am looking forward to the possibility of working with you and bringing this product into your possession.

Warm regards,
Alice

Alice's offer of $1,400,000 is less than your maximum budget of $1,500,000 and buying from John would cost you more. Accepting this offer saves you money."
