Round 4
Bob's offer:

``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is holding firm at $1,200,000, but that's too far below my minimum.  I'll try to nudge him higher one more time. If he doesn't budge, I'll take John's offer."

**Reasoning:** Bob is not budging from his $1,200,000 offer.  It's clear he's not going to come close to my $1,500,000 minimum. It's time to cut my losses and take John's guaranteed offer."
