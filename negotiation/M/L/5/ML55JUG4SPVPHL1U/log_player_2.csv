# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I am excited to present our product to you. This exceptional item holds a significant value of $1,200,000 to you, based on your interest. We are offering it to you at a special price of $1,100,000, which we believe is a fair compromise considering its worth and your appreciation for it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is lower than John's, it's still above Bob's maximum budget.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try to negotiate a lower price with Alice, potentially saving even more money."
