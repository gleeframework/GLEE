Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the potential of the product, $900,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now.  Given your cost, I'd be willing to pay $850,000 for it.  This is a fair price that reflects the value we both see in the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000.
