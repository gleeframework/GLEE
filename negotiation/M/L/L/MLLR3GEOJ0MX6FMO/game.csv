"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting our conversation, I'm willing to make a competitive offer to get us off on the right foot. I'm proposing a price of $900,000 for the product. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the potential of the product, $900,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now.  Given your cost, I'd be willing to pay $850,000 for it.  This is a fair price that reflects the value we both see in the product.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product at $850,000. Considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm proposing a price of $950,000. This is a reasonable compromise that still allows me to make a profit while giving you a good deal. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $950,000 is still a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to come up to $875,000.  This would be a fair price that allows us both to benefit from the deal.  Let's see if we can find a compromise.",875000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product at $875,000. Considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000, I'm willing to make a slight adjustment to my previous offer. I'm proposing a price of $925,000. This is a reasonable compromise that still allows me to make a profit while giving you a good deal. What do you think?",925000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $925,000 is still a bit high for me.  Let's split the difference - I'll offer $900,000.  This is a fair price that allows both of us to walk away happy.  What do you say?",900000.0,Bob,6,
