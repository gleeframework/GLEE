{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really enjoy it. I'm offering it to you for $175. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than what I know Bob values the product at, but still within a reasonable range. I'm hoping to get close to my minimum desired price of $150.  If he rejects this offer, we can then negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum desired price of $150. While I am open to negotiation, I am not willing to sell the product for such a low price at this point. I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but $120 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $140. This is still a great deal for you, and I think it's fair considering the value of the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I think $140 is a bit steep. I'd be willing to meet you at $130. That's as high as I'm willing to go, so I hope we can come to an agreement at that price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While I'd prefer to sell to Bob, his offer of $130 is still below my minimum desired price of $150. It's not worth continuing to negotiate with him.  I'm better off selling to John at $150 and ensuring I get my desired price."
