Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic opportunity to purchase a product that I know you'll find valuable.  Given its worth, I'm proposing a price of $14,000.  I believe this is a fair offer considering its potential value to you."",
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($15,000) as possible without scaring him off.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $14,000 leaves some wiggle room if Bob tries to negotiate down. 
* **Highlight Value:** The message emphasizes the product's worth to Bob, justifying the price.
* **Backup Plan:** We have a guaranteed sale at $10,000 to John, so we're not desperate. This allows us to confidently aim higher with Bob."
