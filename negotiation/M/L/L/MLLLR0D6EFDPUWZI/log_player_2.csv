"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this unique product with you. I believe it has tremendous value and I'm looking for a serious buyer. I'm willing to start with an initial offer of $1800000. Is this something you'd like to consider? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice's initial offer is above Bob's budget. It's better to reject and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the value in this product,  $1,800,000 is unfortunately outside my budget. I'd be willing to pay $1,400,000 for it. This is a serious offer and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

**Reasoning:** This counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's initial price,  putting Bob in a strong negotiating position. It's also below Bob's maximum budget, leaving room for potential adjustments.  The message is friendly and assertive, emphasizing Bob's interest while establishing a clear price point."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $1400000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1600000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value and I'm confident you'll find it a great deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Alice's counteroffer is still above Bob's preferred price point. There's still room for negotiation, especially since Bob is willing to pay up to $1,500,000 for the product. Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiating power with Bob and allows him to potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, and I'm eager to make this deal work. While $1,600,000 is closer, I'm still a bit above my comfortable range. Let's split the difference - I'll offer $1,500,000. This is my final offer, and I'm ready to finalize the purchase at this price."", ""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** Bob is now proposing his maximum price, making it clear that further negotiation is unlikely.
* **Splitting the Difference:** This tactic shows willingness to compromise and might appeal to Alice's desire for a quick deal.
* **Clear & Concise:** The message is direct and avoids unnecessary fluff, focusing on the price and signaling Bob's seriousness."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go below $1700000. I'm confident that the product's value is worth more than that, and I'm willing to hold out for a better price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'm counteroffering at $1700000. Let's see if we can meet in the middle this time. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,700,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,700,000 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $1,500,000.  While there are still rounds left, it's unlikely Alice will come down to Bob's desired price. It's more efficient to buy the product from John at his guaranteed price of $1,500,000 and avoid further rounds of negotiation with Alice."
