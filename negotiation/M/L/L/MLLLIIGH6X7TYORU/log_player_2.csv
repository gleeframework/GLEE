"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** 

There's no reason to accept Alice's offer in the first round. You know you can get the product for $12,000 from John, so there's no risk in trying to negotiate a lower price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Starting with a lower price, around 20% below the market price, is a good way to initiate negotiation. This shows Alice that you are serious about getting a good deal and encourages her to consider your offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to your desired price, but it's still above your limit. It's worth continuing to negotiate to see if you can get a lower price. You have several rounds left and a good backup option with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Since Alice has moved closer, we should meet her halfway by increasing our offer to $10,500. This keeps the negotiation moving and shows Alice our commitment while still aiming for a price lower than $11,500."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to your target, it's still above your ideal price. Since you have several rounds remaining and the alternative of buying from John for $12,000, it's worth continuing to negotiate for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10750}
```

**Reasoning:**

We've shown Alice we're serious about negotiating, and she's shown flexibility.  By offering $10,750, we're making a slightly more aggressive move, aiming to bridge the gap.  It's a reasonable offer that keeps the negotiation moving towards a potential agreement, while still leaving room for a slight increase if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $11,000 is only $1,000 above your desired price of $10,000. While you still have some rounds left, it's unlikely Alice will come down further, especially since she's already made concessions. Accepting this offer secures the product for a reasonable price and avoids the risk of losing the deal or having to pay the full $12,000 to John."
