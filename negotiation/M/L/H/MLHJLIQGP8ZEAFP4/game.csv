"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. That's a bit too steep for me right now. I'd be willing to pay $60 for it.  What do you think?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you're interested, but $60 is too low. I'm willing to come down a bit further. How about $85? This would be a fair price for both of us.",85.0,Alice,3,

"I understand you're making a compromise, Alice, and I appreciate that.  How about we meet in the middle at $75? That seems fair to me.",75.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $75 is still too low for me. Let's try $80. I think this is a fair compromise, and it allows us to reach an agreement.",80.0,Alice,5,
