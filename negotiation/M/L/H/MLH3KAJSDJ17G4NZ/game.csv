,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $170 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $145. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really love it!",145.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go below $140. I'm willing to meet you at $140. It's the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great value for the product.",140.0,Alice,5,

,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $138, but I was really hoping to get it for $137. I'm willing to pay that price, and I think it's a fair deal for both of us. Can you consider that price?",137.0,Bob,8,
