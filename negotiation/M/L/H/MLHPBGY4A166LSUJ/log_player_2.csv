"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $12,000 is a better price than John's offer, there's room for negotiation. It's worth exploring if Alice is willing to drop the price further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob starts with a significant counteroffer, aiming to get a price closer to his ideal value while leaving room for negotiation. Offering $10,000 demonstrates Bob's intent to seriously negotiate while still showing respect for Alice's initial offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $13,000 is a better deal than buying from John, Bob can likely still get a better price. He's already demonstrated his willingness to negotiate, and Alice has shown flexibility. It's worth another round to see if a compromise closer to $10,000 can be reached."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has shown a willingness to negotiate, and Alice has already dropped her price.  By offering $11,000, Bob is demonstrating a gradual approach, increasing his offer but still aiming for a significant discount compared to Alice's initial price and John's offer.  This is a reasonable counteroffer that could lead to a successful agreement within Bob's budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $13,500 is still a good deal for Bob compared to buying from John for $15,000.  While Bob could continue to negotiate and try for a lower price, there's a risk that Alice might not budge further or the negotiations could drag on for too long.  Accepting this offer allows Bob to secure the product within his budget and avoid potentially wasting time with further bargaining."
