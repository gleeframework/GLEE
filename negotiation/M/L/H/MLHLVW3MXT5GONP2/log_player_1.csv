**Reasoning:**

Bob is very slowly inching up his offer price.  At this pace, it's unlikely he'll reach a price that's significantly better than John's offer of $15,000, especially with only 5 rounds remaining.  It makes more business sense to take the guaranteed $15,000 now than risk getting a lower offer from Bob later."
