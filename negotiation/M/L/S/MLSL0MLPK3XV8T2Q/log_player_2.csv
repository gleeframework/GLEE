"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

You can get the product from John for $10,000, so anything above that is a loss for you.  Rejecting Alice's offer allows you to try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with the lowest price I'm willing to pay. This sets the stage for negotiation and signals my seriousness in getting a good deal.  It's unlikely Alice will accept this right away, but it will give us a starting point for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $11,500 is closer to my limit, I'm still able to get it for $10,000 from John.  I'll continue negotiating with Alice in hopes of getting a better price, but I'm prepared to walk away if needed."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly, showing a willingness to compromise.  $10,500 is a middle ground between my previous offer and Alice's latest offer.  This demonstrates that I'm serious about buying the product while still trying to secure a better price than $11,500."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is getting closer to my target price, it's still above what I can get from John. I'm willing to keep negotiating with her, hoping to drive the price down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly willing to negotiate. I'm increasing my offer again, but staying below her latest price. This shows good faith and keeps the negotiation moving forward. Hopefully, we can reach a deal before I have to go with John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting closer to my target, but I'm still able to get the product from John for less. I'll continue negotiating to see if I can get her down to $11,000 or even lower, but I'm not afraid to walk away if necessary."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $11,100. I'm counteroffering at $11,000, which is a small increase from my previous offer. I'm trying to show that I'm close to accepting her price but still hoping to secure a better deal.  If she accepts this, I get a better deal than from John, and if she rejects it, I'm still in a good position to go to John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $11,050. This is only $50 more than my last counteroffer and is within my acceptable range.  It's better than John's price and we're in the final rounds.  I'm willing to accept this offer to close the deal."
