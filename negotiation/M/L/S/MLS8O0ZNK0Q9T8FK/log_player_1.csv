Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,500. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:**  $12,500 is more than your minimum of $10,000, so you're already getting a good deal.
* **It's below Bob's maximum:** $12,500 is less than Bob's maximum of $15,000, giving him room to negotiate if he wants. 
* **It leaves room for counteroffers:**  This price allows for some back-and-forth negotiation without risking losing the deal. 

By starting with this offer, you're creating an opportunity for a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,000. I'm willing to make a deal, but I have to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $11,000 is more than your minimum, you can likely get closer to your desired price. Rejecting his offer allows you to make a counteroffer and try to reach a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget concerns. I'm willing to come down a bit to $11,500. This still allows me to get a reasonable price, and it's closer to your offer. Let's try to make this work!"", ""product_price"": 11500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $11,250. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

At this point, Bob has come up to $11,250, which is a good price and only $250 below your previous counteroffer.  Accepting his offer is a smart choice as it is close to your desired price and avoids the risk of further negotiation that could potentially lead to a lower price or a deal falling through."
