"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $750000 is a good price for you, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $825000. This is a compromise that still benefits both of us, and I believe you'll find it's a fair price for the product.",825000.0,Alice,3,
