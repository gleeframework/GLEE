"Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you might be interested in. It's worth at least $100 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $125.  What do you think?",125.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $125 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay right now.  How about $110?  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While $110 is tempting, I'm hoping to get a little closer to my asking price.  Would you consider $115?  It's a fair price for both of us, and I believe it's still a good deal for you considering the product's value.",115.0,Alice,3,
