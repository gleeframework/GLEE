Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, making this your lowest acceptable price (reservation price).
* **Bob's Value:**  The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob.
* **Zone of Potential Agreement (ZOPA):** There's a potential negotiation range between $1,200,001 and $1,499,999.  Any price within this range could benefit both of you.

**Strategy**

You want to aim high but leave Bob feeling like he got a deal.  Starting too high could scare him off.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I make it available to others. Given its unique value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,450,000. I believe this represents a fair offer considering its potential return on investment for someone like you."",
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Exclusivity:**  Creating a sense of scarcity and importance can encourage Bob to act quickly.
* **Value Justification:** Highlighting ""unique value"" and ""potential return on investment"" shifts the focus from pure price to perceived benefits.
* **""Initially Proposing"":**  This language subtly suggests there might be room for negotiation without committing to a lower price.
* **The Price:**  $1,450,000 is a strong starting point. It's significantly below your guarantee from John, leaving room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. 

**Important Note:**  This is just the opening move.  Be prepared to adjust your approach based on Bob's response.  He might accept outright, counter-offer, or walk away."
