# Alice's message: Dear Bob,
I am delighted to present you with an extraordinary opportunity to acquire our flagship product, which holds immense value to us at $1,000,000. Recognizing its worth to you might be even greater, I propose to offer it to you at a special introductory price of $950,000. This exclusive offer is designed to ensure that both parties benefit from this transaction, reflecting the product's true market value while allowing for a favorable deal.

Please let me know if this proposal aligns with your expectations and financial considerations. I am here to facilitate a smooth negotiation process and answer any questions you might have about the product or the terms of this offer.

Looking forward to your positive response,
Alice 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $950,000 is under your $1,000,000 limit, you know you have another option with John.  There's a chance you could get a better price by rejecting Alice's offer and seeing if she's willing to come down further. You'd save $50,000 if you buy from John instead."
