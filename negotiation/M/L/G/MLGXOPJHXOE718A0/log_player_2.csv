"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **$9,000 is a good price, but it's still early in the negotiation.** There's a strong chance you can get an even better deal by counter-offering. 
* **You have 10 rounds to negotiate.**  This gives you plenty of time to explore lower prices.
* **Buying from John immediately is a waste of your bargaining power.** You know you have a fallback option, but you should leverage it strategically."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 7000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but reasonable:**  A $2,000 drop from Alice's initial offer shows you're serious about getting a good deal, but it's not so low that it risks alienating her.
* **Leaves room for negotiation:** This counteroffer allows for some back-and-forth.  You're not aiming for a single-round deal, but to start a conversation that leads to a mutually beneficial price. 
* **Keeps you within your budget:**  Even if Alice rejects this offer, you're still in a good position to keep negotiating within your $15,000 limit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is moving closer to your price.**  $8,200 is a significant improvement from her initial $9,000.
* **Still room for negotiation:** There's likely more room to squeeze the price down, as Alice is already willing to compromise.
* **Avoiding the John trap:**  While $8,200 is a good price, buying from John right now would mean you're leaving money on the table. There's still value in continuing the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 7500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:**  This offer splits the difference between your previous offer of $7,000 and Alice's latest offer of $8,200. This demonstrates a willingness to compromise and shows that you're taking her counteroffer seriously.
* **Maintaining leverage:**  While this offer is closer to Alice's, it's still within your budget and leaves room for further negotiation in the remaining rounds.
* **Balancing risk and reward:**  Accepting Alice's offer would be a good deal, but you're not in a rush. By counter-offering, you're increasing your chances of getting an even better price without significantly risking the deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to your target:**  $8,100 is only $100 more than your last counteroffer of $7,500. This is a very good deal, especially considering Alice's initial price of $9,000.
* **Limited remaining rounds:** With only 5 rounds left, the risk of continuing to negotiate and potentially missing out on this offer is too high.
* **John is a safe backup:** You have a guaranteed escape route if the negotiation falls apart.  

**It's time to take the deal. You've secured a good price, and you've still got a safety net with John if things go wrong.**"
