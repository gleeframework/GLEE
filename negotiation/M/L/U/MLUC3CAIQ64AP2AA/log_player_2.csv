"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

It's better to reject Alice's offer and try to negotiate a lower price.  $9,000 is more than your maximum budget, and you can try to get closer to your desired price point in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 7500} 
```

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $7,500. This is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still leaves some room for negotiation.  It's important to show Alice that you're serious about getting a good deal, but also to be realistic about what you're willing to pay."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,400. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,400
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Alice's offer is closer to my budget, it's still above what I'm willing to pay. I'm going to reject the offer and continue negotiating, hoping to get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $8,000. This is my maximum budget, and I'm hoping Alice will be willing to accept it, given that it's only $400 below her last offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 

While I would prefer to pay $8,000, Alice's offer of $8,200 is a reasonable compromise, and I'm running out of negotiation rounds. It's better to accept this offer than risk losing the deal and having to buy from John at $8,000."
