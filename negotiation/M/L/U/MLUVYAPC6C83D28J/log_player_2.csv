"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

The product is worth $100 to Bob, and Alice is offering it at $130. This is clearly above Bob's maximum price.  Bob should reject the offer and attempt to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob knows the product is worth $100 to him, so he should start by offering his maximum price. This is a bold move, but it sets a clear boundary and might encourage Alice to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $115 is closer to Bob's maximum price, it's still more than he's willing to pay.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue negotiating and potentially secure a lower price.  He has 7 rounds left, giving him room to maneuver."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to get the best deal possible. He's already rejected a price of $115, so he's willing to go up slightly from his initial offer. This counteroffer is a compromise, showing Alice he's serious about buying but still wants a lower price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price to $110. This is still above Bob's ideal price, but he only has 5 rounds left.  He has two options:

* **Accept:** He gets the product for $110, which is $10 more than he'd prefer, but it's a reasonable compromise.
* **Reject:** He risks losing the product to John, who will sell it for $100, but also risks Alice increasing her price again or becoming unwilling to negotiate further.

Given the limited rounds and the risk of losing the deal altogether, accepting Alice's offer at $110 is the most logical choice."
