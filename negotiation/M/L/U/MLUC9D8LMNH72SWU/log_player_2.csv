The product is worth $1,500,000 to Alice, and she's asking for $2,000,000. This indicates there's room for negotiation. It's worth rejecting her initial offer and making a counteroffer to get a better price."

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still above what I'm willing to pay. It's better to continue negotiating and see if we can find a price closer to my $1,200,000 counteroffer."
