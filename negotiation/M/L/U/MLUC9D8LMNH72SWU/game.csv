"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you see in the product, $2,000,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your response.  I understand your perspective, but the value of this product is truly significant. I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $1,750,000?",1750000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,750,000 is a step in the right direction, I'm still not quite there.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $1,200,000.  It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product for me. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
