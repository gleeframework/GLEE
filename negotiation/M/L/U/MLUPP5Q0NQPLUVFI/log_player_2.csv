"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You want to save as much money as possible, so rejecting Alice's first offer is the best move. You can try to get a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $9,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. Let me know if you're open to that."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $8,500 is still quite a bit below what I need to get for this product. I'm willing to come down a bit more, though. How about $9,000? This is a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You are still trying to get a better price, and you know John will sell you the product for $8,000. Rejecting Alice's offer and making a counteroffer is the best strategy for now."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm happy to pay $8,750 for the product.  This is a fair compromise that allows us both to reach a good agreement. "", ""product_price"": 8750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm glad we're making progress.  $8,750 is still a bit below what I need to make this work. I'm willing to meet you halfway on this one.  Let's go with $8,875. This is a fair compromise that allows us both to get a good deal. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,875. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,875
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice is getting closer to your desired price, but $8,875 is still more than you want to pay. Since you have a guaranteed option to buy from John for $8,000, it makes sense to take that option now rather than risk further negotiation with Alice."
