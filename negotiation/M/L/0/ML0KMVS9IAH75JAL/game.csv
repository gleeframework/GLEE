"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the market value and my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. However, $900,000 undervalues the true potential of this product.  I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,200,000?",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I still think $1,200,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. I believe that's a fair price considering the market value and my budget.",950000.0,Bob,4,
