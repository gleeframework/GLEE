Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe would be of great value to you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $130. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're aiming to earn more than $100, so this price achieves that.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** Bob is willing to pay $150, so there's space for him to counteroffer, and for you to potentially meet in the middle.
* **It's not too aggressive:**  Offering $149 right away might make Bob suspicious or less likely to negotiate.

Remember, the goal is to maximize your profit while also making a deal.  This initial offer allows for flexibility while keeping your interests in mind."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for offering the product, Alice. I appreciate your suggestion. However, I was hoping to find a price closer to $100. Would it be possible for us to negotiate down to $110? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $110 is better than $100 (which you could get from John), there's still room to negotiate.  

Rejecting Bob's offer allows you to counter with a price closer to your desired outcome.  By showing that you're willing to negotiate, you might be able to secure a higher price than Bob's initial counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $110 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to come down to $120. This would still be a great deal for you, given the value of the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 120}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product, but I'm still hoping for a price closer to my budget. Could we possibly agree on $115? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob has come up slightly from his previous offer, and we're now only $5 away from his initial offer.  At this point, it's likely that we can't get a better price from Bob.  Accepting the offer ensures a sale at a price that is within a reasonable range of our desired profit."
