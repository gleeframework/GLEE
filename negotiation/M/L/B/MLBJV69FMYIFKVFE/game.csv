"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility.  $15,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows.  I'm happy to pay $10,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  While I understand your perspective, I believe the product's value warrants a higher price. How about we meet in the middle at $12,500?",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $12,500 is closer to what I can afford, but I'm still hoping we can find a compromise. How about $11,000?  This is still a good deal for you, and allows me to buy the product within my budget.",11000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, you're getting closer.  I'm willing to come down a bit more to $11,800.  This feels like a fair compromise to me.",11800.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $11,800 is a good offer, but I'm still hoping for a price that works for both of us.  I'm willing to pay $11,500.  This is a fair compromise, and allows me to buy the product within my budget.",11500.0,Bob,6,
