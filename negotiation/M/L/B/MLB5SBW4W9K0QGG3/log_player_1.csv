Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $15,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $12,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about we split the difference and go with $10,500?  This seems like a fair price considering both of our positions.
