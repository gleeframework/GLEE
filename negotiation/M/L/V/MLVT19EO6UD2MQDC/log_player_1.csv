Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm suggesting a price of $2,000,000. This is a time-sensitive offer, as I do have other interested parties."", ""product_price"": 2000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, starting negotiations higher allows room for negotiation without risking a loss.
* **Justification:** Highlighting the ""exclusive opportunity"" and the product's ""value and potential"" attempts to justify the high asking price.
* **Time Pressure:**  Mentioning ""other interested parties"" creates a sense of urgency, potentially pushing Bob to make a decision quickly. 

**Important Considerations:**

* This strategy is aggressive. Bob might reject the offer outright if he finds the price unreasonable.
* You need to be prepared to negotiate if Bob counters. Know your lower limit (which shouldn't be below $1,500,000)."
