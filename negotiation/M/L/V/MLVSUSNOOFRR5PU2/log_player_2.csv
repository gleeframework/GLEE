Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product and your counteroffer.  While I acknowledge your perspective on its value,  $1,200,000 is significantly below what I need to make this deal worthwhile. I'm willing to come down to $1,700,000, which still allows for a substantial margin for your business.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position.  However, $1,400,000 is still below the value I've placed on this product.  To be fair to both of us, I'm willing to go down to $1,550,000. This leaves room for you to generate a good return and keeps me close to my minimum price.  Let's find common ground on this figure.
