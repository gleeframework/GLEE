Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think your initial price is a bit too high. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to my business.

While I acknowledge your perspective on its value,  $1,200,000 is significantly below what I need to make this deal worthwhile. I'm willing to come down to $1,700,000, which still allows for a substantial margin for your business.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap."", ""product_price"": 1700000}

This leaves room for you to generate a good return and keeps me close to my minimum price.  Let's find common ground on this figure."", ""product_price"": 1550000}
