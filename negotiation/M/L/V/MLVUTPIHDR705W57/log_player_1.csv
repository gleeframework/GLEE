Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm only able to go up to $10,500 right now.  Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While $10,500 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable value. I'll try to push for a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your offer, but I'm still hoping to get closer to my asking price. How about $10,800? It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find the product worth it at that price."", ""product_price"": 10800}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still stuck at $10,500. That's my final offer. If it doesn't work for you, I'll have to consider other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $10,500 is close to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a little more. I'll counter one more time before considering selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're firm on your price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can't go lower than $10,650. It's a small difference, but it means a lot to me.  Let me know if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 10650}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your situation, but $10,650 is still a bit too high for me. I'm prepared to walk away at this point. How about we meet in the middle at $10,550? This is my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,550. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,550
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

I'm running out of rounds and Bob seems unwilling to budge.  While $10,550 is closer to my minimum, John is offering my target price. It's time to move on and sell to John."
