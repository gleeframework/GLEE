Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a better deal, but $80 is a bit low for me. I can do $120, but that's as low as I can go.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I was thinking more along the lines of $110. That's the lowest I can go. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** 

While Alice is slowly coming down on price, it's clear she's aiming for a price above your $100 limit.  You've already reached a price point where John will sell you the product, so there's no benefit to further haggling with Alice."
