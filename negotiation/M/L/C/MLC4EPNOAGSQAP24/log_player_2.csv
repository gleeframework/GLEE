"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your interest in the product.  After careful consideration, I'm initially offering it to you for $1,100,000. I believe this reflects its significant value and potential for your business. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $1,100,000 is still too high for Bob's budget. He should try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your offer is still a bit too high for me. I'm really interested in the product, but my budget is capped at $800,000.  Would you be willing to come down to that price?"", ""product_price"": 800000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product and understand your budget constraints.  However, $800,000 significantly undervalues what it brings to the table.  To move this forward, I can come down to $1,000,000.  This is a considerable compromise on my end and reflects my desire to find a fair deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

Bob should still reject Alice's offer. While it's a step in the right direction, $1,000,000 is still above his budget. He should try to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still not able to reach $1,000,000.  I'm willing to offer $900,000, which is a significant increase from my initial offer and closer to your position.  Let's try to find a compromise that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  I'm willing to come down slightly more to $975,000. This is a very competitive price and reflects the significant value this product brings. However, I need to be transparent â€“ I have another interested buyer.  So, I need you to be close to this number for us to make a deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $975,000 is getting closer to his budget, it's still too high. He should try to negotiate further. Remember, he has a backup option with John for $800,000, so he doesn't need to settle for anything that's too far above that."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $975,000 is still slightly above my budget.  I'm willing to go to $950,000.  This is a significant increase from my previous offer and represents a fair compromise for both of us.  Let's see if we can close the deal here."", ""product_price"": 950000}
