"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your interest in the product.  After careful consideration, I'm initially offering it to you for $1,100,000. I believe this reflects its significant value and potential for your business."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm beginning with a strong offer close to my minimum value but leaving room for negotiation. This allows me to potentially secure a higher price if Bob is eager.
* **Justification:** I'm framing the price with a brief mention of the product's value, aiming to subtly anchor Bob's perception of it.
* **Leaving the Door Open:** The tone remains open to negotiation, signaling that I'm willing to have a conversation to reach a mutually beneficial deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer is still a bit too high for me. I'm really interested in the product, but my budget is capped at $800,000.  Would you be willing to come down to that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly below my minimum acceptable price. Accepting would mean a substantial loss. I know John offers a guaranteed $1,200,000. However, I'll use the next few rounds to attempt to negotiate a better price with Bob before resorting to John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product and understand your budget constraints.  However, $800,000 significantly undervalues what it brings to the table.  To move this forward, I can come down to $1,000,000.  This is a considerable compromise on my end and reflects my desire to find a fair deal for both of us."",
""product_price"": 1000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant but Strategic Drop:**  The $100,000 reduction shows willingness to negotiate but keeps me well above Bob's initial offer.
* **Emphasis on Value:** I'm reiterating the product's value to counter Bob's lowball offer subtly. 
* **Compromise Language:**  By framing the offer as a compromise, I aim to create a sense of reciprocity, encouraging Bob to move closer to my price range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still not able to reach $1,000,000.  I'm willing to offer $900,000, which is a significant increase from my initial offer and closer to your position.  Let's try to find a compromise that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is improving, it's still significantly below my $1,200,000 walk-away point (selling to John).  I'm willing to negotiate further, but I need to see Bob showing more flexibility before considering an offer below John's guaranteed price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  I'm willing to come down slightly more to $975,000. This is a very competitive price and reflects the significant value this product brings. However, I need to be transparent â€“ I have another interested buyer.  So, I need you to be close to this number for us to make a deal."",
""product_price"": 975000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Smaller Concession:** I'm reducing the price by $25,000, a smaller step than before, signaling I'm approaching my limit. 
* **Firm but Fair:** The language emphasizes that this is a competitive offer, close to my bottom line. 
* **Introducing John:** I'm bringing in the alternative buyer (without specifics) to create a sense of urgency and encourage Bob to be more realistic with his counter-offer. 
* **Seeking a Close:** I'm aiming to get Bob close to my target in the next round or two. If he's not willing to move substantially, I'll likely sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $975,000 is still slightly above my budget.  I'm willing to go to $950,000.  This is a significant increase from my previous offer and represents a fair compromise for both of us.  Let's see if we can close the deal here. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $950,000 is now within a reasonable range of my $1,200,000 walk-away point. While I could push for a bit more in subsequent rounds, there's a risk Bob might not budge much further, and I'd lose the opportunity to make a good profit.  It's better to secure a favorable deal now than risk losing the sale altogether."
