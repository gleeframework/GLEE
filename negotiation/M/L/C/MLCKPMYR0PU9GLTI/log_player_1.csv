Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but given my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price closer to my maximum willingness to pay. How about $15,000 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position.  While $20,000 represents the value of this product, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $17,500?"", ""product_price"": 17500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. Considering my budget and the value I place on this product, I would like to propose a price of $16,000. This allows us to stay within my financial limits while still acknowledging the value you place on the item. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
At this point, Bob is getting very close to my minimum acceptable price. While I could push for a bit more, accepting his offer of $16,000 is a good compromise to ensure a sale and avoid the risk of him walking away.
