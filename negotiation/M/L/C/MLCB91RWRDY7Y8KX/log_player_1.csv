{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $14,000. I think this is a fair deal considering the benefits it will bring to your business."",
""product_price"": 14000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** We know Bob values the product at $15,000.
* **Your Minimum:** You need at least $8,000.
* **Maximizing Profit:** To maximize profit, you should aim for a price slightly below Bob's maximum valuation. 
* **Negotiation Room:** Offering $14,000 leaves some room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer. 

By starting high, but still within a reasonable range for Bob, you increase the chances of securing a profitable deal while still having John as a backup option."
