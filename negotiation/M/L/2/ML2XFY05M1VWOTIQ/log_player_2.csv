Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hey Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. While I appreciate your interest, $50 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $100?  That's still a great deal for you, and it gives me some room to work with.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $70 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $90, which is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's try to reach an agreement!

It's unlikely Alice will go much lower, and it's not worth risking going over budget.  John offers a safe and acceptable price."
