{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm asking for $130 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting at $130, which is a bit higher than Bob's perceived value of $80. This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Leaving room for counteroffers:** $130 is also below my minimum acceptable price of $150, so I have room to negotiate down if necessary.
* **Positive message:** I'm framing the offer in a positive light, highlighting the product's potential value to Bob. 

Let's see what Bob says!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for offering, Alice! That's a bit too steep for me right now.  Would you consider $50? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $50. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $50
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $50 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150 and even below what Bob thinks the product is worth ($80).
* **Negotiation is possible:**  While Bob's initial offer is unacceptable, it indicates he's still interested. There's potential for negotiation.
* **Avoiding selling to John:**  Selling to John guarantees $150, but I'm aiming for a higher price. 

I'll counter Bob's offer with a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. While I appreciate your interest, $50 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $100?  That's still a great deal for you, and it gives me some room to work with."", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** I'm proposing a price that's halfway between my initial offer ($130) and Bob's offer ($50). This shows a willingness to compromise.
* **Highlighting the value:** I'm reminding Bob that $100 is still a great deal for him, as it's significantly less than what the product is worth to him ($80).
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  While $100 is closer to my desired range, I'm still leaving some room for negotiation in case Bob is hesitant."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand, $50 is quite a jump. How about $70? That's closer to the middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still low:** While $70 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still well below my desired range and even below what Bob believes the product is worth.
* **Potential for further negotiation:**  Bob is willing to negotiate and is clearly interested in the product.  I believe there's potential to reach a more favorable price.
* **Avoiding selling to John:** Selling to John guarantees $150, but I'm determined to achieve a higher price if possible. 

I'll counter Bob's offer again, aiming for a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $70 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $90, which is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's try to reach an agreement!"", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Staying firm but flexible:** I'm not accepting $70, but I'm showing flexibility by lowering my offer to $90.
* **Highlighting value again:** I'm reminding Bob that $90 is still a great deal for him, as it's less than what he believes the product is worth.
* **Expressing optimism:** I'm ending with a positive note, emphasizing my desire to reach an agreement. 

I believe this offer strikes a balance between being firm and being open to a deal.  Hopefully, Bob will see the value in accepting."
