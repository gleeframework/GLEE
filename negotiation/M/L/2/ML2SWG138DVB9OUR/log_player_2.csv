The product is worth no more than $120 to me, and Alice's offer is too high. I will reject and make a counteroffer."

I'm offering $100 for the product. This is a fair price considering my maximum budget and the fact that Alice's initial offer was too high."

Alice's offer is still above my maximum budget. I'll reject her offer and try to negotiate further."

I'm willing to go up to $115, which is closer to my maximum budget and hopefully a more reasonable price for Alice."
