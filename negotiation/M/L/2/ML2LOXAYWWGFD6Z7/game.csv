"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're looking to spend closer to $8,000, but I'm still hoping to get a better price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $10,500. This is a great compromise, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value.",10500.0,Alice,3,
