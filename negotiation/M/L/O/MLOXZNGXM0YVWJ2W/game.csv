"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,500,000. Is this something you'd like to consider?",1500000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer but $1,500,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your concern about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,200,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's still a great deal for you.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,200,000 is still above my budget. I'm prepared to offer $1,000,000 for the product, which I believe is a fair price for both of us. This is my final offer.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to sell the product to you for $1,000,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm willing to offer the product to you for $1,100,000. This is my final compromise.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
