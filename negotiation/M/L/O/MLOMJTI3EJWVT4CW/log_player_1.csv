"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a fantastic deal, considering the value it holds for you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than my minimum, but still leaves room for negotiation and gives me a strong starting point.
* **Emphasis on value:** I highlight the value the product holds for Bob to make the offer seem more appealing.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** By not going for the full $1,500,000, I allow space for Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially reach a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Potential for a better deal:**  While $1,100,000 is a good price, I believe I can still get closer to my ideal price. 
* **Negotiating leverage:** Bob has shown his willingness to negotiate, so I have leverage to push for a higher price.
* **Risk mitigation:** Selling to John at this point would secure a guaranteed $800,000, but I'm willing to risk continuing negotiations to see if I can secure a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your offer, but $1,100,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000.  This reflects the value of the product for you, and still allows me to make a decent profit.  Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:**  I'm meeting Bob halfway by lowering my price from $1,200,000 to $1,150,000.
* **Maintaining a profit margin:** This price still allows me to make a substantial profit, exceeding my minimum of $800,000. 
* **Expressing urgency:**  I emphasize closing the deal to encourage Bob to accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1,150,000, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,080,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,080,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:**  While $1,080,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I still have a few rounds left and am not desperate to close the deal immediately.
* **Potential for better deal:** I believe I can still push for a higher price, potentially somewhere in the mid $1,100,000 range.
* **Maintaining negotiation leverage:**  By rejecting Bob's offer, I maintain control of the negotiation and can potentially push for a better deal.
* **Risk mitigation:**  While selling to John would secure $800,000, I believe the potential for a higher price with Bob justifies taking the risk of continuing negotiations."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get a great price, and I'm willing to work with you.  Let's split the difference and go with $1,115,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and we can close this deal right now. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1115000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the difference:** I'm offering a price halfway between my previous offer and Bob's latest offer, showing a willingness to compromise.
* **Highlighting fairness:** I emphasize the ""fairness"" of the price to appeal to Bob's sense of reason.
* **Urgency:** I again suggest closing the deal now to encourage a quick decision. 
* **Staying above minimum:**  This offer still keeps me well above my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to work with me, but I think we can do even better. I'm willing to pay $1,060,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,060,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,060,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Approaching the minimum:**  While $1,060,000 is getting close to my minimum, I'm still hesitant to accept as it's only $60,000 above my minimum acceptable price.
* **Negotiation leverage:**  I have several rounds remaining and believe I can still push for a higher price, especially since Bob is clearly willing to negotiate.
* **Potential for better deal:**  I'm hoping to secure a price closer to $1,100,000.
* **Risk mitigation:**  Selling to John at this point would guarantee $800,000, but I'm willing to risk continuing negotiations to see if I can get closer to my ideal price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $1,060,000 is just a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $1,095,000. This reflects the value of the product for you, and we're getting very close to a deal. Let's close this now."", ""product_price"": 1095000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway (again):**  I'm again meeting Bob halfway by offering a price between his last offer and my previous offer. This shows a willingness to compromise.
* **Emphasizing value:**  I remind Bob of the value of the product to encourage him to accept the offer. 
* **Urgency:**  I'm increasing the pressure by suggesting closing the deal ""now"" to encourage a quick decision.
* **Above minimum:**  This offer is still above my minimum acceptable price and closer to my ideal price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I think we can get even closer to a deal. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Running out of time:** We're down to two rounds left.
* **Close to minimum:**  Bob's offer is only $50,000 above my minimum acceptable price.  
* **Low potential for a better deal:**  Given Bob's recent offers, it's unlikely he'll go much higher.
* **Minimizing risk:**  Selling to John guarantees me a significant profit, and I'm not willing to risk losing a substantial amount by continuing to negotiate with Bob.  

At this point, it's more prudent to secure the guaranteed profit from John rather than risk further negotiation with Bob."
