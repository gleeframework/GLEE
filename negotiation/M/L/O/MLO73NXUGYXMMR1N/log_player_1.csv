Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Offer price:** I'm starting with a price of $900,000. This is higher than Bob's perceived value ($800,000) but lower than my minimum acceptable price ($1,000,000). 
* **Message:** I'm using a friendly tone and highlighting the value of the product to Bob to encourage him to consider the offer.

**Strategy:**

This strategy aims to:

* **Maximize profit:**  $900,000 is closer to my desired outcome than selling to John for $1,000,000.
* **Encourage negotiation:** The offer leaves room for negotiation, potentially leading to a higher price.
* **Preserve the option to sell to John:** If negotiations fail, I can still sell to John for $1,000,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is too low.** $750,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. 
* **Negotiation is still possible.** I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob, hoping to reach a more agreeable price. 

**Strategy:**

By rejecting Bob's offer, I am:

* **Maintaining my position:** I'm showing Bob that I'm not desperate to sell at his price.
* **Keeping the negotiation alive:** This allows me to potentially reach a higher price through counteroffers.
* **Preserving the option to sell to John:** If negotiation fails, I can still sell to John for $1,000,000.

**Next Step:**

I will counteroffer Bob with a price that is still higher than his offer but closer to my desired outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While I understand $750,000 is your preferred price, it's below my minimum for this item.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000.  This price is still a good deal for you, considering the product's value. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm offering $850,000, which is a compromise between my initial offer ($900,000) and Bob's offer ($750,000).
* **Message:**  I'm highlighting the value of the product and trying to find common ground with Bob.
* **Reasoning:**  
    * This price is still above Bob's perceived value, giving him an incentive to accept.
    * It's closer to my minimum acceptable price, increasing my potential profit.

**Strategy:**

This strategy aims to:

* **Find a middle ground:** By compromising, I'm showing Bob that I'm serious about negotiating.
* **Maintain a profitable price:**  $850,000 is closer to my desired outcome than $750,000.
* **Keep the negotiation going:**  This approach avoids a premature termination of negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $850,000 is a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to meet you halfway between $750,000 and $850,000, so I'm offering $800,000. Is this a price you'd be willing to accept? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is close to my minimum acceptable price.**  $800,000 is only $200,000 below my desired outcome. 
* **Further negotiation might not be fruitful.**  Bob seems to be firm on his $800,000 offer, and further negotiation might only lead to a stalemate or a lower price.

**Strategy:**

By accepting Bob's offer, I am:

* **Securing a profitable sale:**  $800,000 is still a significant profit for me.
* **Avoiding a potential loss:**  If I keep rejecting Bob's offers, I risk losing him as a buyer and having to settle for the $1,000,000 offer from John.
* **Minimizing the risk of a stalemate:**  Continuing negotiations might lead to a deadlock and no sale.

**Outcome:**

By accepting Bob's offer, I've managed to secure a sale that is close to my desired price, ensuring a profitable outcome and avoiding the risk of losing the deal."
