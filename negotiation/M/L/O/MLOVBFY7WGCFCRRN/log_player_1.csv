Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of the significant benefits it offers."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($1,500,000) as possible. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $1,400,000 leaves some space for potential negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. 
* **Strong Value Proposition:** The message emphasizes the ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""significant benefits,"" subtly reinforcing the product's high value.

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes you don't have time to engage in extensive back-and-forth negotiation with Bob. If you have more time, you might start with an even higher offer."
