Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $120. This is a good starting point as it's significantly higher than my minimum price of $80, but still leaves room for negotiation if Bob wants to counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $90 is better than selling to John, I believe I can get a higher price.  I'll counter Bob's offer and see if we can reach a more mutually beneficial agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm countering Bob's offer with $100. This is a compromise that still gives me a decent profit while acknowledging Bob's desire for a lower price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob's offer of $85 is only $5 less than what John is offering.  It's not worth risking further negotiation, especially since Bob seems unwilling to go higher."
