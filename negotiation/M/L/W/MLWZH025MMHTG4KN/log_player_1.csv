Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you my product for $1,450,000. This is a fair price that allows us both to benefit from the transaction. Please let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 1450000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting point:**  I'm aiming for a price closer to my value ($1,500,000) while still being attractive to Bob. A $1,450,000 offer gives Bob a decent discount from his value ($1,200,000) and makes the negotiation worthwhile for him.
* **John as leverage:**  I'm using John as a safety net. Knowing I can get $1,500,000 elsewhere gives me confidence to hold firm on a price above Bob's initial value.
* **Negotiation potential:** By starting with a reasonable offer, I open the door for further negotiation. Bob may counter, and we can work towards a mutually acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,300,000. This is the highest price I'm willing to pay for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is lower than my minimum:** While Bob's offer is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum of $1,500,000.  Accepting it would mean a significant loss for me.
* **Negotiation is still possible:**  I'm using John as a safety net.  I can use him as leverage in the next round to push Bob closer to my desired price.
* **Time is on my side:** If I reject Bob's offer, I can counteroffer and try to get a better price.  This gives me more control and time to explore all my options."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position.  While I appreciate your offer, I'm still committed to getting a price closer to my asking value.  I'm willing to come down to $1,375,000. This is a fair compromise that allows us both to make a reasonable profit.  Let me know if you're interested in this offer."", ""product_price"": 1375000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:**  My counteroffer is a compromise, splitting the difference between my previous offer ($1,450,000) and Bob's offer ($1,300,000). This shows willingness to negotiate and makes the deal more appealing to Bob.
* **Maintaining leverage:** While coming down in price, I'm still significantly above Bob's initial offer.  This reinforces my position and makes him realize the deal is still advantageous for him.
* **Emphasis on fairness:** Highlighting ""fair profit"" for both parties strengthens the case for my counteroffer and encourages a positive response from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit far from my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,200,000 and $1,375,000, so I'm thinking of $1,287,500. This is the highest price I'm willing to pay for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,287,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,287,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:**  While Bob is getting closer to my desired price, his offer of $1,287,500 is still below my minimum of $1,500,000. 
* **John is a better option:**  I have a guaranteed buyer in John who is willing to pay my minimum price.  Further negotiation with Bob risks losing time and ultimately not achieving my desired outcome.
* **Time is limited:**  I need to maximize my profit, and John offers a guaranteed sale at the price I'm comfortable with.  Continuing with Bob may lead to a lower price or a deal that drags on too long."
