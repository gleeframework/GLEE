Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $11,999. I think it's a fair price considering its value. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 11999
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as much money as possible from Bob, knowing you have a guaranteed sale at $12,000 from John.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product just below John's price ($11,999) creates a sense of urgency and potential savings for Bob. 
* **Negotiation Room:** While this is a high offer, it leaves a tiny bit of room for Bob to potentially counter-offer, though unlikely.  

This strategy aims to secure a sale price higher than your minimum while leaving Bob feeling like he's getting a good deal."
