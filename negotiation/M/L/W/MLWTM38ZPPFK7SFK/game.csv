"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,500,000. I'm open to discussing this further, so please let me know your thoughts.",1500000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,500,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product to me. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective, but $1,100,000 is quite a bit below its true value. How about we meet in the middle at $1,350,000?",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,350,000 is still a bit steep for me.  Let's split the difference and go with $1,250,000. This is a fair price, and I'm confident it's a good deal for both of us.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
