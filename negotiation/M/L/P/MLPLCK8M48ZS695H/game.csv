"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire this valuable item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $15,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's worth to you is $12,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the value it will bring to your life.",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I appreciate you acknowledging the value of the product to me. However, $15,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows.  I'd be happy to pay $12,500 for it.  What do you think?",12500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $12,500 is a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $13,500. This is a compromise that still reflects the value I believe the product holds, while also being more in line with your budget. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thanks for your compromise. I appreciate that you're working with me on this.  $13,500 is still a little more than I'd like to spend.  Would you consider $13,000? I believe this would be a fair price for both of us.",13000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $13,000 is still a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer you the product for $13,250. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, as I still need to make a profit. I think this is a fair compromise, considering the value the product holds for you. What do you think?",13250.0,Alice,5,
