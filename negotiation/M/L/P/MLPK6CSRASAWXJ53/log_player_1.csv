"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,600,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for discussions. What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 1600000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to begin negotiations with an offer higher than your desired outcome. This provides room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest and price sensitivity.
* **Justification:** By highlighting the ""unique features and potential"" of the product, you reinforce its value and provide a reason for the high initial price.
* **Open to Discussion:**  Phrases like ""a fair starting point for discussions"" and ""What are your thoughts?""  signal your willingness to negotiate and encourage Bob to actively engage in the process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the initial asking price. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,100,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:** 

While Bob's offer is above his perceived value, it's still significantly below your minimum and what John is offering. You have room to negotiate and aim for a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. However, the product's value significantly exceeds that amount, making it difficult to accept. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a price of $1,350,000. This reflects the true worth of what's being offered."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledge and Reject:** We acknowledge Bob's counteroffer but clearly state it's not acceptable due to the product's value.
* **Justification:** Re-emphasizing the product's value helps justify the higher counteroffer.
* **Compromise (Appearing to):**  By stating we're meeting ""halfway,"" we create a sense of compromise, even though the price is still closer to our initial offer. This can encourage Bob to move closer to your desired range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. While I understand the value of the product, I must stick to my budget. I would like to counter with an offer of $1,250,000. I hope this is within your considerations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has now offered a price higher than John's offer and above your minimum. While you could try to negotiate further, there's a risk Bob will lower his offer or walk away. Accepting this offer secures a profit and avoids the potential loss of both buyers."
