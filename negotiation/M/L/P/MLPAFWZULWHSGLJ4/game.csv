"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to acquire a valuable product. I believe it's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to start the conversation with a price of $1800000. What do you think?",1800000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product is significant to me, but I am looking to keep my investment within a certain budget. Could we perhaps meet somewhere closer to $800000?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to keep your investment within a budget, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $800000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to the product's true value. I'm thinking of a price of $1200000. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. Given my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price closer to $900000. This still reflects the value I see in the product while staying within my financial limits.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $900000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1200000 and $900000, which would be $1050000. This is the best I can do for now. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand your position, Alice. Considering my budget and the value I place on the product, I would like to propose a price of $1000000. This is my final offer.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your final offer, Bob, but I'm still not convinced we've reached the product's true value. I'm willing to meet you at $1100000, which is a compromise between our previous discussions. This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Respectfully, Alice, I must decline your offer. Given my financial constraints and the value I place on the product, I cannot agree to a price of $1100000. I will instead proceed to purchase the product from John for $800000.",800000.0,Bob,8,
