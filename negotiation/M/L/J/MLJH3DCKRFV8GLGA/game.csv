"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me.  The product is worth $1,500,000 to you, and I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $1,400,000? It's a fair compromise, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us.",1400000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit far from my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $1,350,000? I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget.",1350000.0,Bob,4,
