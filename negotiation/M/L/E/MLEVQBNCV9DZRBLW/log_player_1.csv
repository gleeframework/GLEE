Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is based on the following logic:

* **My floor price:**  I value the product at $15,000, so I won't accept anything less.
* **Bob's value:**  Bob values the product at $8,000.  
* **John's offer:** John is willing to pay $15,000, so I have a guaranteed safety net.

By offering $14,000, I'm leaving some room for negotiation while still maximizing my potential profit.  Bob gets a deal, and I still get a good price."
