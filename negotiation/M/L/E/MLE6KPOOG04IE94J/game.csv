"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $100 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps around $60?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $60 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $85? This is a fair price that allows both of us to benefit from this deal.",85.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're trying to find a middle ground. How about $70? That's a significant jump from my previous offer and shows I'm serious about buying.",70.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm open to $75, but that's my final offer. If we can't agree, I'll have to explore other options.",75.0,Alice,5,
