"Bob, thanks for your counter-offer. I understand your perspective, but $600,000 is significantly below its true value and potential.  I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. I believe this reflects the value it would bring to your business in the long run.",1900000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  To show I'm serious about finding a price that works for both of us, let's try $1,600,000.  This is a significant reduction on my part and reflects my desire to close this deal.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
