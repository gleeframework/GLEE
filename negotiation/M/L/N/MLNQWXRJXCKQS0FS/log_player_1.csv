Round 2
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000

Round 3

""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counter-offer. I understand your perspective, but $600,000 is significantly below its true value and potential.  I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. I believe this reflects the value it would bring to your business in the long run."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000

Bob is still far below a reasonable price point.  We need to signal we're willing to negotiate but not desperate. Rejecting this offer keeps the door open for further negotiation."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  To show I'm serious about finding a price that works for both of us, let's try $1,600,000.  This is a significant reduction on my part and reflects my desire to close this deal."",

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but we still have a way to go. I can do $800,000. This is my final offer. Take it or leave it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's final offer is his maximum value:** Bob has explicitly stated this is his final offer and it aligns with his previously stated valuation of the product ($800,000).  
* **Further negotiation is unlikely to yield a significantly better outcome:** Bob has shown he's unwilling to move much higher.
* **John offers a guaranteed $1,500,000:**  Accepting John's offer avoids further negotiation risk and guarantees a significant profit.

While we could continue negotiating, the potential upside is outweighed by the risk of Bob walking away, leaving us with a less favorable outcome than John's guaranteed offer."
