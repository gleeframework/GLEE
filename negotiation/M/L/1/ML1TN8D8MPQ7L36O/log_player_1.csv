"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting with a price that is 50% higher than my minimum acceptable price. This is a bold move, but it allows for some room to negotiate. If Bob rejects, I can gradually lower the price while still aiming for a good profit.  I also want to get a feel for how interested he is in the product and how much he's willing to pay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, but I believe I can still get a better deal. I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14500}
```

I'm countering with a price that's halfway between my last offer and Bob's offer. This shows flexibility while still aiming for a profit above my minimum. If Bob accepts, it's a good deal for both of us. If he rejects, it will give me a better idea of his true upper limit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, but I still think I can get a better deal. I'll reject his offer and try to push for a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13750}
```

I'm countering with a price that's  midway between Bob's last offer and my previous one.  This shows I'm willing to be flexible while still attempting to get a fair price. It also provides an opportunity to test if Bob is willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I still believe there's room for negotiation. I'll reject his offer and try to push for a higher price in the next round.  I'm aware I'm running out of time, but I'm not ready to settle for a price significantly lower than what I believe the product is worth."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13250}
```

I'm countering with a price that's $500 higher than Bob's last offer.  This shows that I'm still willing to negotiate, but I'm also firm on getting a price that's closer to my desired value. I'm hoping this will push Bob to make a final, acceptable offer in the next round. If he rejects again, I'll have to seriously consider selling to John, as the remaining rounds are limited."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I've reached a point where I need to be practical. While I'd prefer to get closer to my desired price,  Bob's last offer is still below my minimum acceptable price. With only two rounds left, I'm not confident I can convince Bob to go higher.  Selling to John guarantees me a profit, and it's the most sensible decision at this point."
