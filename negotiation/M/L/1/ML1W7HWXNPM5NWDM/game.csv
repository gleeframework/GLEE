"Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to get your hands on this amazing product. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value to you.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I agree your product is valuable, the price point is a bit high for me right now. Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $700,000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to negotiate. I can consider $750,000, which is a compromise between our initial offers. It's a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product.",750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice.  However, $750,000 is still a bit beyond my budget.  Would you be open to $725,000?",725000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make another concession. I can offer you $735,000, which is closer to your target. However, I'm getting closer to my minimum acceptable price. I hope we can meet in the middle.",735000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, thanks for continuing to work with me. I'm willing to move up slightly to $730,000. I think this represents a fair deal for both of us.",730000.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your willingness to move up, Bob. However, I'm still not convinced that $730,000 is enough to justify the value of the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $735,000 and $730,000. How about $732,500?",732500.0,Alice,7,
