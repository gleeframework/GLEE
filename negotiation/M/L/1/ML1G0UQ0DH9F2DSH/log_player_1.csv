I'm starting with a price of $18,000. This is a reasonable starting point, as it's above my minimum value but still potentially appealing to Bob, given his value of $15,000.  I'm hoping to get as close to his value as possible without going below my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is too low for me.  I'm not willing to go below $15,000. I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm counter-offering at $16,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer. I'm hoping this will be a sweet spot where we can both agree."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While Bob's offer of $14,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still not ideal.  I'm confident that John is a reliable buyer and will pay my minimum price of $15,000. I'm choosing to sell to John to ensure I get my desired amount without further negotiation."
