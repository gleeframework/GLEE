"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you my product. It's a unique opportunity for you, and I believe it's worth at least $1,200,000. I'm confident this will be a mutually beneficial transaction. Let me know your thoughts.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $950,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  Considering the product's potential value to you, I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This represents a significant price reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let's see if we can close this deal.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,050,000 is still too much for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000, which is a fair price considering the value of the product and my budget. Let's see if we can finalize the deal.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
