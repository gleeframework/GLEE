# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you my product. It's a unique opportunity for you, and I believe it's worth at least $1,200,000. I'm confident this will be a mutually beneficial transaction. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is too high. It's well above her own valuation and leaves significant room for negotiation.  I can likely get a better deal by rejecting and making a counteroffer."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $950,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  Considering the product's potential value to you, I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This represents a significant price reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let's see if we can close this deal.
