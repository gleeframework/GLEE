"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $14,000. I'm confident this is a fair starting point for negotiations. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $14,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $8,000.  What do you think?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counter-offer.  I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $8,000 is significantly below its true value. To move this forward, I can come down to $12,000.  This feels like a fair compromise. What do you say?",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  While $12,000 is closer, it's still a bit more than I'm aiming to spend. Could you meet me in the middle at $10,000? That would be a fair deal for both of us.",10000.0,Bob,4,
