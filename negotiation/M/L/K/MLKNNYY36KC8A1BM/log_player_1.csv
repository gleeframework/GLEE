"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $14,000. I'm confident this is a fair starting point for negotiations. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $14,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $8,000.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","Bob's offer is significantly lower than both my valuation and my initial ask. While I want to find a deal, accepting such a low price in only the second round would leave a lot of potential money on the table.  I'm better off seeing if I can negotiate him up.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your counter-offer.  I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $8,000 is significantly below its true value. To move this forward, I can come down to $12,000.  This feels like a fair compromise. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 12000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  While $12,000 is closer, it's still a bit more than I'm aiming to spend. Could you meet me in the middle at $10,000? That would be a fair deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","Bob has now met my minimum acceptable price. There's no guarantee I can negotiate him higher, and continuing carries the risk of him lowering his offer or me needing to settle for John's offer.
