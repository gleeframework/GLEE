"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,000. It's a great deal, and I know you'll be happy with it."", ""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value, hoping to maximize my profit. However, I'm not going for a crazy high number, as I want to keep the negotiation open and avoid Bob immediately rejecting the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the product, but I can't afford $9,000. My maximum budget is $8,000. Would you consider reducing the price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, I'm going to reject it for now. I believe I can still potentially get a higher price from Bob.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While I can't go down to $8,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway.  Let's settle on $8,500. It's a fair price for both of us, and I know you'll be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 8500} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I still can't go above $8,000 for this product. I believe we can reach an agreement within my budget. Would you be able to offer the product at $8,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob is firm on his $8,000 offer, and I've already rejected his offer once.  While I'd prefer to get a higher price,  I'm at risk of losing the deal altogether if I continue to reject his offers.  It's better to accept his offer now and secure the sale."
