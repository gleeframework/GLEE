"Hi Bob, I understand that $180 is a bit high for you, but I think the product is worth more than $100. I'm willing to meet you in the middle and sell it to you for $160. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product!",160.0,Alice,3,,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to go all the way down to $110. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $160 and $110, which is $135. It's a great price for a fantastic product, and I think you'll really love it!",135.0,Alice,5,,
