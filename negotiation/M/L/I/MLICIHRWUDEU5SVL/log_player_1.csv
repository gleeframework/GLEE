Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Value:** We know Bob values the product at $1,000,000, but that doesn't directly influence our starting price.
* **Our Minimum and John's Offer:**  We have a guaranteed offer from John for $1,500,000, which serves as our absolute minimum. 
* **Aiming High, Allowing Negotiation:** Starting with $1,350,000 leaves room for negotiation while still securing a significant profit above John's offer.
* **Urgency and Scarcity:**  By mentioning other interested parties and a limited-time offer, we create a sense of urgency and scarcity, potentially encouraging Bob to act quickly."
