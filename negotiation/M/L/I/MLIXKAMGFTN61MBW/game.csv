"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. It's a fantastic opportunity for you, and I'm confident you'll find it a valuable asset. Let me know what you think!",1750000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your enthusiasm, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,400,000. I'm interested in the product, but I have to be mindful of my budget.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I value your interest, $1,400,000 is a bit too low for me.  However, I'm willing to be flexible.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,550,000? This price still allows for a good return for me and a fair deal for you.",1550000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but I still think $1,550,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $1,450,000?",1450000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand we're getting closer.  While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,450,000 still doesn't quite work for me.  Let's try $1,525,000. This is a fair compromise that considers both our needs. It's a great deal for you, and it allows me to move forward with the sale.",1525000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still a bit hesitant at $1,525,000. I'm willing to go up a bit more, but I think $1,475,000 is the highest I can go. Let's see if we can meet in the middle from there.",1475000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to go up, but $1,475,000 is still a little too low for me.  Considering the value of this product and our ongoing negotiations, how about we settle at $1,495,000? It's a small step for you, but it gets us closer to a deal.  I'm confident you'll agree that this price reflects the product's worth.",1495000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I think we're getting close, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,495,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $1,462,500? I'm trying to find a mutually beneficial price, but I need to stay within my budget.",1462500.0,Bob,8,
