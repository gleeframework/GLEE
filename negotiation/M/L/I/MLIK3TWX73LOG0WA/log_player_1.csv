"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $2,000,000. It's a great deal considering the value it holds for you. Let's talk!"", ""product_price"": 2000000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **High Initial Offer:** I'm starting with a high offer to maximize my potential profit.  It's unlikely Bob will accept this immediately, but it sets the stage for negotiation.
* **Emphasis on Value:** I mention the value the product holds for Bob to make the offer seem more appealing. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** I end with a friendly tone, signaling I'm open to discussion."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I think it's a bit too high. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  While it's better than nothing, it's significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Potential for a better deal:**  I believe I can get closer to my desired price with more negotiation.
* **Time to counter:**  I'll use the next round to send Bob a counteroffer that's more reasonable for me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit. Let's meet in the middle at $1,700,000. This still gives you a good deal, considering the value you've mentioned. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1700000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Reasoning:** I acknowledge Bob's offer, but emphasize that it's too low for me.
* **Counter-Proposal:** I propose a middle ground price of $1,700,000, which is still above my minimum but shows a willingness to compromise.
* **Appeal to Value:**  I remind Bob of the value the product holds for him, making the offer more attractive. 
* **Open-Ended Question:** I end with an open-ended question to encourage further discussion and potentially reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,500,000 for the product. Can you consider my revised offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting my minimum:** Bob's offer of $1,500,000 is exactly my minimum acceptable price.
* **No need to risk further negotiation:**  There's no guarantee that I can get a better price with more rounds of negotiation.
* **Time is valuable:**  Accepting this offer saves time and guarantees a sale.

While I'm still not getting my ideal price, it's a good deal considering Bob's initial offer and my desire to avoid the risk of a failed negotiation."
