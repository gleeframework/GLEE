"Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $950,000 is a better price than John's $1,200,000, there's still room for negotiation.  Bob should aim to get the price closer to Alice's $800,000 value. A counteroffer will give him a chance to do so."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is offering $850,000, which is a significant discount from Alice's initial offer of $950,000. This counteroffer shows that Bob is serious about buying the product but is also trying to get the best possible deal.  This counteroffer is also within his $1,200,000 limit and is a good starting point for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's counteroffer of $900,000 is still higher than what Bob is willing to pay.  While it's closer to Bob's desired price, there's still room to negotiate further and potentially get a better deal. Another counteroffer could help Bob get closer to his target price without risking buying from John at a much higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 875000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is increasing his offer slightly from $850,000 to $875,000. This shows Alice that he's serious about buying the product and is willing to compromise.  However, it's still a considerable amount lower than Alice's current offer, and potentially closer to a point where both parties could find an agreeable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $885,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $885,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $885,000 is very close to Bob's last counteroffer of $875,000. At this point, it's likely that further negotiation will be very difficult and may lead to a stalemate.  Accepting Alice's offer allows Bob to secure the product at a price that is within his budget and significantly less than John's offer."
