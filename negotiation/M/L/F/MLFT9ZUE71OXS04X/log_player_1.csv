"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm starting high with a price of $1,000,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value of $800,000. This allows room for negotiation and hopefully encourages Bob to make a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $800,000 is my minimum, I'm not willing to accept it right away.  I'll try to get closer to my desired price by counteroffering in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm going to counter with $900,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer and shows I'm willing to negotiate, but still leaves some room for potential profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $775,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not willing to accept it.  I believe there's a chance I can get a better deal, and I'm not yet at the point where selling to John seems like the best option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

I'm going to counteroffer with $850,000.  This is still above my minimum, but it shows I'm willing to negotiate and hopefully will encourage Bob to make a final push."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $775,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $775,000 is a tempting offer, I'm still not at the point where I want to accept it.  There are still rounds left, and I'm hoping to get a little closer to my desired price. I'm also hesitant because I'm not sure if Bob will continue to increase his offer, or if he's just going to keep offering $775,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 825000}
```

I'm going to counter with $825,000. This is a slight decrease from my last offer but still above my minimum. With only a few rounds left, I need to start getting closer to a deal, but I'm not ready to accept anything lower than my minimum yet."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $775,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

With only two rounds left, I'm running out of time to get a better deal from Bob. He keeps offering $775,000, which is below my minimum. I'm not confident he will increase his offer, so selling to John for $800,000 is the best option at this point."
