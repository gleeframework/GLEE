"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $20,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice's offer of $20,000 is significantly higher than both your maximum price ($12,000) and Alice's own valuation ($15,000).  There's plenty of room for negotiation. You know you have a backup option with John at $12,000, so you're in a strong position to push for a much lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is way too high for me. I'm thinking closer to $8,000 would be reasonable.  What do you say?"",
""product_price"": 8000
}
```

**Reasoning:** Starting with a low offer of $8,000 gives you room to negotiate upwards.  While this is a significant difference from Alice's opening offer, it's important to be assertive in your initial counteroffer to steer the negotiation in your favor."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for the offer, but $8,000 is too low for me.  This product is truly valuable and I can't go below $17,000.  I think it's a fair price. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  Alice has come down from her initial offer, but $17,000 is still significantly higher than your target price and John's offer.  It's clear there's still negotiating room. By rejecting, you signal that you're serious about a lower price and willing to walk away if necessary."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $17,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend.  How about we meet in the middle at $12,000? I think that's a fair offer."",
""product_price"": 12000
}
```

**Reasoning:** In this round, we jump straight to your maximum price of $12,000. This serves two purposes:

1. **Signals your limit:** It clearly shows Alice you're serious and this is the highest you're willing to go. 
2. **Potential for quick agreement:**  If Alice is willing to accept a price around your target, this could end the negotiation quickly in your favor.

By framing it as ""meeting in the middle,"" you present a sense of compromise, even though it's already your maximum price."
