Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000

This is a good deal for both parties involved. Bob is offering the maximum he perceives the product is worth to him, and you're getting substantially more than you would from John. There's no guarantee you can negotiate a higher price with Bob, and risking losing this deal for a potentially insignificant gain isn't worthwhile."
