Bob's offer:

Bob's offer:

Bob's offer:

**Reasoning:**

Bob's final offer is getting too close to a point where further negotiation might yield minimal gains.  It's unlikely he'll go much higher, and the difference between his offer and John's guaranteed price is significant enough to warrant taking the sure thing.  John represents a no-risk, high-reward option that outweighs the potential for a slightly higher offer from Bob."
