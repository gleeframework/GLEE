"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product, $1,100,000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your position, but the product's value to me is quite significant. I could consider coming down to $1,025,000. I believe this represents a fair compromise. What do you think?",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  However, $1,025,000 is still a bit higher than what I can afford right now.  I'm willing to go up to $950,000.  This feels like a fair compromise for both of us.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I've tried to be flexible, but the lowest I can go is $985,000.  I believe the product's inherent value justifies this price.  Let me know your final decision.",985000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to get a certain price for the product, but $985,000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $975,000, which is a fair compromise considering my previous offer. This is my final offer, and if it's not acceptable, I'll have to look elsewhere.",975000.0,Bob,6,
