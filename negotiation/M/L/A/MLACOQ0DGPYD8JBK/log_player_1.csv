"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your interest in the product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm offering it at $2,200,000. I'm confident it will exceed your expectations and deliver exceptional returns."", 
""product_price"": 2200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations with a strong anchor point. By starting significantly higher than Bob's perceived value and my minimum, I leave room for negotiation while aiming for a high potential profit.
* **Confident Tone:**  The message conveys confidence in the product's value, potentially influencing Bob's perception.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message doesn't sound like an ultimatum, leaving space for Bob to counteroffer. 

This strategy allows me to gauge Bob's willingness to pay while keeping the option of selling to John always open."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the value of the product, I believe we can find a price that suits both of us. How about we aim for $1,200,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is closer to his perceived value, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price. Accepting would mean a substantial loss compared to selling to John. I believe there's room for negotiation to bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the value, however, the product's unique features and market potential warrant a higher price.  How about we meet halfway and settle at $1,700,000?"",
""product_price"": 1700000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Show Flexibility:** By significantly reducing my initial asking price, I demonstrate a willingness to negotiate and find a mutually agreeable solution. 
* **Justify the Price:** I reiterate the product's value to Bob, subtly pushing back against his lower valuation.
* **Strategic Counter:** Offering a price exactly in the middle of our previous offers might encourage Bob to engage more seriously, moving the negotiation towards a favorable outcome for me. 

I'm still aiming for a price significantly above Bob's initial offer and my minimum. I'll continue to assess the situation and keep the option of selling to John on the table."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your response. Considering the current market conditions and my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price of $1,400,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has now significantly increased his offer, reaching $1,400,000. While this is still below John's offer,  the difference is no longer large enough to justify the risk of continued negotiation. Bob might be reaching his upper limit, and there's no guarantee he'll go higher.  

Accepting at this point secures a substantial profit compared to Bob's initial offer and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation rounds."
