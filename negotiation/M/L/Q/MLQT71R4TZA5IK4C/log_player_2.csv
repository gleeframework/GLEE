Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. However, $900,000 is simply too low for me to consider.  The value of this product is significantly higher.

This price reflects a fair compromise, allowing us both to achieve our desired outcomes.
