Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the market value and my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price.  While I want to close the deal, I'm not willing to settle for a price that undervalues the product. I'll counteroffer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. However, $900,000 is simply too low for me to consider.  The value of this product is significantly higher.  I'm willing to be flexible, but I need a price closer to my initial offer. Let's meet in the middle.  I'm proposing $1,050,000.  This price reflects a fair compromise, allowing us both to achieve our desired outcomes."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your concerns, but $1,050,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I can only go up to $1,025,000. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,025,000

Bob's offer of $1,025,000 is close to my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000, and I want to close the deal.  I'll take it."
