"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the market value and my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget. What do you think?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. However, $900,000 is simply too low for me to consider.  The value of this product is significantly higher.  I'm willing to be flexible, but I need a price closer to my initial offer. Let's meet in the middle.  I'm proposing $1,050,000.  This price reflects a fair compromise, allowing us both to achieve our desired outcomes.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your concerns, but $1,050,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I can only go up to $1,025,000. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price. What do you think?",1025000.0,Bob,4,
