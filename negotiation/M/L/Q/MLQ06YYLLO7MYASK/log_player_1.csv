Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. It's a great deal for a product worth much more, and I believe it would be a valuable asset for you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $13,000, which is above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive framing:** I emphasize the value and potential of the product for Bob, making it more appealing.
* **Open to negotiation:** I leave the door open for counteroffers and further discussion.
* **Safety net:** I'm aware of John's offer, so I can always walk away if Bob's offers become too low. 

By starting at $13,000, I aim to maximize my profit while leaving room for negotiation. This strategy balances my need to earn as much as possible with the potential to reach a mutually agreeable price with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am looking to stay within a budget of $10000. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $10000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $10,000 is far below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  
* **Room for negotiation:** I can potentially get a better price by rejecting his offer and counteroffering. 
* **John's offer provides a safety net:** If negotiations with Bob fail, I can still sell to John for a much better price.

**Next steps:**

I will send Bob a counteroffer that is closer to my desired price, but still leaves room for compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $10,000 is unfortunately too low for me. However, I'm willing to be flexible. How about we meet in the middle at $12,000? This would still give you a great deal on a valuable product, and it's a price I can comfortably accept. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-offer strategy:** My counteroffer is a compromise, showing flexibility while still aiming for a higher price. 
* **Mid-point negotiation:** Offering $12,000 (the middle ground between my initial offer and Bob's offer) creates a sense of fairness and encourages further negotiation.
* **Positive framing:**  I reemphasize the value of the product for Bob and highlight the benefits of the compromise.

By offering a counteroffer closer to my desired price but still leaving room for negotiation, I aim to find a solution that benefits both of us."
