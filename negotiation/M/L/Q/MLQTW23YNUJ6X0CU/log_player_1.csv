Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the opening offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit steep for me. How about we bring it down to $700,000? I think that's a fair price that reflects the value it offers. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
