"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident it will be worth every penny to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's starting offer is too high. I have plenty of room to negotiate and try to get a price closer to her value of $12,000.  I'm willing to risk a few rounds to see if I can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $10,000?"",
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** I'm starting with a significantly lower counteroffer to try and understand Alice's negotiating range. This offer is slightly below her product value, but it gives us plenty of room to negotiate towards a mutually agreeable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest but $10,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $12,500. This is still a great price considering the value of the product for you. Let's see if we can find a compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Alice came down in price, indicating she's willing to negotiate. However, $12,500 is still a bit too high. I'll continue to counter-offer and try to meet somewhere closer to the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. How about we meet in the middle at $11,250?"",
""product_price"": 11250
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** I'm proposing a price directly in the middle of our last two offers. This shows willingness to compromise while still aiming for a significant saving."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position. I'm willing to go down to $11,750. This is a fair price, considering the value of the product to you. I'm confident we can reach a deal at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice is getting closer to a price I'm willing to accept, but I think there's still room for improvement. I'll continue negotiating, but I'll be prepared to accept a price around $11,500 in the next round or two."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, you're getting closer.  I'm willing to offer $11,400 to try and close this deal."",
""product_price"": 11400
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** This offer is a significant movement towards Alice's last price, signaling I'm serious about closing the deal soon. It's a reasonable compromise that still saves me a good amount compared to John's offer."
