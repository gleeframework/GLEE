"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I was hoping to pay. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1,000,000. Let's see if we can work together to find a mutually beneficial price.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,000,000 is still below my minimum acceptable value. Let's compromise.  I'm willing to drop my price to $1,100,000. This is a significant concession on my part, and I believe it's a fair offer considering the product's potential for you. ",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,100,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, at $1,050,000. This is my final offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
