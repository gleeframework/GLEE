"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential, I'm initially offering it at $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the significant return on investment you're likely to see.",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, while I see the potential of the product, $1,300,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to offer $1,000,000. This is a fair price that reflects both the value of the product and the opportunity for a quick sale for you.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 undervalues the product significantly. I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000. This price reflects the true value you'll be gaining while still offering a fair deal.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,200,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,100,000.  This price allows for a fair profit for you while staying within my budget. Let's aim for a mutually beneficial agreement.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
