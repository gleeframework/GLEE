{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a unique product I'm offering for sale.  It's worth a lot to me, but I'm open to discussing a fair price. I'm initially offering it for $20,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 20000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum to leave room for negotiation.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I emphasize my willingness to discuss a fair price to encourage Bob to counteroffer.
* **Value Proposition:** I hint at the product's value to me without revealing specifics. This might make Bob think it's worth more and be more willing to pay. 
* **John as a Safety Net:**  Knowing John's offer gives me a baseline for the lowest acceptable price. If Bob's counteroffers are too low, I can always walk away."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $20000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $8000.  Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $8,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Potential for a better deal:** I believe there's still room for negotiation with Bob. I'm willing to explore counteroffers to see if we can find a mutually acceptable price.
* **John as a Safety Net:**  I know I can always sell to John for $15,000, so I'm not under pressure to accept Bob's low offer."

{""message"": ""Hi Bob, Thanks for your interest! While $8,000 is a bit low for me, I appreciate your offer.  Let's find a middle ground. How about $12,000? It's still a good deal for you and allows me to make a fair profit. "", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  I'm proposing a price that's halfway between my initial offer and Bob's offer. This shows I'm willing to compromise.
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm maintaining a friendly tone to keep the negotiation going.
* **Value Justification:** I'm highlighting the value of the product by emphasizing that $12,000 is still a good deal for Bob. 
* **Strategic Compromise:** This counteroffer allows for further negotiation but keeps me above my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  $12000 is still a little high for me. I'm happy to meet you halfway.  How about $10000?  That's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:** While $10,000 is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Opportunity for a better deal:** I believe I can still negotiate a higher price. Since I have the option to sell to John, I'm not under pressure to accept a price below my minimum.
* **Potential for compromise:** I'm willing to consider a counteroffer, but I'll aim for a price closer to my target."

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  $11000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference and go with $10500.  That seems like a fair price for both of us.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** Bob's offer of $10,500 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. However, it's still below my target.
* **Risk of Further Negotiation:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob carries the risk of him lowering his offer even further, potentially ending up with a price even closer to my minimum.
* **John's Offer:** Selling to John for $15,000 guarantees me my minimum acceptable price and ensures I don't lose out on potential profits by continuing a drawn-out negotiation.

While I would prefer a higher price, the certainty of John's offer outweighs the potential risk of further negotiation with Bob."
