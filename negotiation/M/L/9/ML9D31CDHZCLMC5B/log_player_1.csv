"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a unique opportunity with immense potential. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm opening with a high price of $1,000,000. This allows room for negotiation and ensures I'm not leaving any money on the table.
* **Positive and Encouraging:** The message is positive and emphasizes the value of the product. It aims to get Bob interested and open to negotiation.
* **Room for Negotiation:** I'm aware that Bob might not accept this initial offer, but it's a good starting point. The subsequent rounds will adjust the price based on his response. 

**Remember:** This is just my opening move. I'll adjust my strategy based on Bob's response and the information I gather throughout the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Offer:** While Bob's offer is significantly lower than my opening price, it's still above my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** I believe there's still room for negotiation. I'm not ready to settle for $750,000 yet, as I'm confident the product is worth more.
* **Strategic Rejection:** Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to maintain my negotiating position and potentially secure a better price. 

I will now proceed to the next round and counteroffer Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer. While I understand your perspective,  $750,000 is a bit too low for me at this point. Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $900,000.  This is still a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to what I need for this product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-Offer:** I'm counter-offering with $900,000, which is halfway between my initial offer and Bob's offer. This demonstrates my willingness to compromise while still maintaining a good profit margin.
* **Emphasis on Value:** I reiterate the value of the product and emphasize that my offer is still a good deal for Bob.
* **Finding Middle Ground:** I frame the counter-offer as finding a ""middle ground,"" which encourages Bob to see it as a fair compromise.

By making this counteroffer, I aim to:

*  Show Bob that I'm flexible but not desperate.
*  Maintain a strong negotiating position.
*  Increase the likelihood of closing a deal in the next few rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I need to be mindful of my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $850000. Is this a price you'd be willing to accept? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Offer:** Bob's offer of $850,000 is just above my minimum acceptable price of $800,000.  This is a good deal for me, considering the potential for further negotiation to be limited. 
* **Time is Money:** With only 6 rounds remaining, I want to avoid the risk of losing further time and potentially ending up with a lower offer or having to sell to John for $800,000.
* **Securing a Profit:** Accepting this offer secures a profit and allows me to move on to other opportunities. 

While I'd love to get closer to my initial price, I need to be realistic about the negotiation process and the remaining time. Accepting Bob's offer ensures I get a good outcome and avoids further uncertainty."
