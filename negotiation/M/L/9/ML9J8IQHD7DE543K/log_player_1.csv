Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a unique opportunity to acquire something worth a lot to you. Let's talk."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

I'm starting high, aiming for a price that's above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium for this product. I'm also leaving the door open for a conversation to understand his perspective and potentially find a mutually beneficial price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $900000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. However, I'm not selling to John yet because there's still potential to get a better price from Bob. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I understand your perspective, $900,000 is still below my minimum.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This is a significant compromise, but I'm confident this product will be worth every penny to you."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $950000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $950,000 simply doesn't work for me. Let's meet in the middle. I'm prepared to accept $1,050,000. This represents a considerable adjustment from my initial offer and a fair price given the product's value to you."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $975000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

We've reached a point where Bob's offers are consistently below my minimum acceptable price, and the negotiation seems to be stalling.  While there's still some potential for a deal with Bob, the risk of further rounds without a significant improvement is too high. It's time to secure the guaranteed $1,000,000 from John and avoid the possibility of losing out on a better deal."
