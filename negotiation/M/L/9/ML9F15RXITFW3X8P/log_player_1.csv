"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm starting high, at $1,000,000. This is a bold opening offer, but it's important to set the bar high to maximize potential profit. Since I don't know Bob's value for the product, I'm leaving room for negotiation while also ensuring I'm aiming for a significant profit above my minimum threshold of $800,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low. While I want to make a deal, $700,000 is significantly below my minimum threshold of $800,000. It's too early to sell to John at $800,000. I'll counteroffer and see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $900,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still leaves me with a profit margin. I'm hoping Bob will see this as a reasonable middle ground and accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum threshold, it's still below the $800,000 I'm aiming for. There's still room for negotiation, and I'm not ready to settle for a lower price yet. I'll counteroffer again and see if I can close the deal closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $850,000.  This is a further compromise, but I'm still holding firm on my minimum threshold of $800,000. With only 5 rounds left, I'm trying to find a balance between securing a profitable deal and avoiding the risk of losing Bob entirely."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $800,000 is my minimum threshold, and I'm happy to secure this price for the product. It's a good deal considering the risk of further negotiation and the possibility of Bob rejecting future offers. With only 4 rounds remaining, I'm confident that accepting Bob's offer is the best course of action."
