"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $900,000 is still too high for Bob, and he has room to negotiate a lower price.  There's a good chance Alice will be willing to lower her price to secure a deal, especially since she values the product at $800,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is offering a price that is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still above her valuation of the product. This is a reasonable starting point for negotiation. It shows Bob is serious about buying the product but is also looking to get a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $875,000 is a good deal for Bob. It's below his maximum budget of $1,000,000, and it's a good compromise considering Alice's valuation of the product at $800,000. There's always the chance he could negotiate a lower price, but the risk of further negotiation might lead to Alice walking away, or Bob needing to buy from John at a higher price.  Accepting the offer secures the product at a reasonable price."
