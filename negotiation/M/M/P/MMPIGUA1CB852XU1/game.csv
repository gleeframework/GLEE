"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested but $12,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 might be a bit high for you, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit on this sale.",11500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  How about we split the difference again and settle at $10,750?",10750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I think I can do a bit better than that. How about we settle at $11,250? I'm getting closer to my minimum price, but I still think it's a fair deal for both of us.",11250.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, you've been great to work with, but I have a pretty firm budget.  My last offer is $11,000.  If that doesn't work for you, I understand, but I'll have to go with a different option.",11000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that you have a budget constraint, Bob, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I've already met you halfway twice, and I'm not willing to go any lower than $11,500. I think this is the best compromise we can reach, and I'm willing to sell the product to you for this price.",11500.0,Alice,7,
