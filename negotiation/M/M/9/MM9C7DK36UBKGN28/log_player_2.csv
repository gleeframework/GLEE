# Alice's message: I have a great deal for you on this amazing product. I'm willing to let you have it for $120.

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is better for Bob than buying from John.**  Buying from Alice saves Bob $30 compared to buying from John. 
* **While Alice's offer is above the product's worth to her ($80), it's still a good deal for Bob.**  He values the product at $150, so even at $120 he's getting a decent discount."
