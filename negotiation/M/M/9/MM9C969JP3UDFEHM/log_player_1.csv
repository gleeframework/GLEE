Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to buy this product before I list it publicly. I think you'll find it's worth the price of $120."", 
""product_price"": 120
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations a bit higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Justification:** By mentioning you think the product is ""worth the price,"" you subtly imply its value to Bob, potentially making him more willing to pay a bit extra.
* **Alternative Buyer (John):**  While you have John as a backup, it's better to try and secure the highest price possible from Bob first."
