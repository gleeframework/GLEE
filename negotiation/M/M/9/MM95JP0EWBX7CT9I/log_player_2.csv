"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I know you'll love! I'm offering it to you for $95. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's initial offer is too high. We have room to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. Would you consider $70?"",
""product_price"": 70
}
``` 

We start with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's asking price but still leaves room for negotiation. This strategy aims to gauge Alice's flexibility and potentially secure a great deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you making an offer, but $70 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $85.  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice moved a bit in her counteroffer, but we still have room to negotiate a better price. We'll continue to counter-offer strategically."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand $70 is low, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $78?"",
""product_price"": 78
}
``` 

We're inching closer to Alice's likely bottom line but still aiming for a price below her perceived value. This offer shows a willingness to compromise while still seeking a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm happy to keep negotiating. How about we split the difference and go with $81?  I think this is a great price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $81. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $81
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice is clearly anchoring on the $80 mark.  While we might be able to push her down another dollar, it's risky. Accepting at $81 secures a reasonable price and avoids the risk of losing the deal altogether."
