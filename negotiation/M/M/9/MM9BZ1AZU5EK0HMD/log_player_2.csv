{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your maximum budget. It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with my maximum budget, hoping to get a deal close to my limit. This sets a strong baseline and shows Alice I'm serious about buying, but also signals my limit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still above my maximum budget. I'm going to try to negotiate further.  There's a chance she may be willing to drop the price even more, or I can counteroffer again and see if she'll meet me somewhere in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly from my initial $1,000,000. This shows Alice I'm willing to compromise, but I'm still trying to keep the price below my limit.  It's a middle ground that may be more appealing to Alice than my previous offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price again, it's still higher than my maximum budget. I'm going to continue to try and negotiate, as I'm not yet willing to pay that much. There's a chance she might be willing to lower the price further, or I can counteroffer again and try to reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer again, showing Alice I'm flexible and willing to meet her halfway.  $1,150,000 is a good compromise point, considering my previous offer of $1,100,000 and her latest offer of $1,250,000.  This is still within my budget, but also close enough to her price that she may be willing to accept it."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,220,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,220,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has continued to lower her price, but it's still above my maximum budget.  I've countered several times, and while there's a chance she might come down further, it's not guaranteed.  To avoid potentially getting stuck in a long negotiation with no clear end, I'm going to buy from John at $1,000,000.  This guarantees I get the product within my budget and avoids risking further haggling with Alice."
