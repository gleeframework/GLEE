"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible.  While $140 is better than $150 from John, there's still room for negotiation.  By rejecting Alice's offer, Bob can attempt to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $140 is a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'm willing to offer $130 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 130} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as 130. How about we meet in the middle at 135? It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is good:**  $135 is a better price than John's $150.
* **No further negotiation:** While Bob could try to get a lower price, there's a risk Alice could walk away. It's better to secure the product at a reasonable price than risk losing it and being forced to pay more to John."
