"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $100 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $65?",65.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hey Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $65 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $82.50? It's a fair price for both of us.",82.5,Alice,3,

"I understand, $65 is a bit low. How about we meet in the middle at $75?",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm willing to be flexible, but $75 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm happy to come down to $80. It's a fair price for both of us, and it's closer to what I need.  Let's make a deal.",80.0,Alice,5,
