"Thank you for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you considering my interest in the product. However, $900000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying at this time. I'd be willing to pay $750000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering my budget and the potential value of the product.  Let me know your thoughts.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  $825000 is closer, but I'm still a bit hesitant.  I'm prepared to go to $800000, but I don't think I can go higher.  It's important for me to stay within my budget, and I'm confident this is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know if you're willing to consider this offer.",800000.0,Bob,4,
