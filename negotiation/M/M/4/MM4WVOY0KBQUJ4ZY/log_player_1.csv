Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. I think it's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** $11,500 is above your minimum price of $10,000, ensuring you make a profit.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  Bob is willing to pay $12,000, so there's a potential for negotiation to reach a price closer to his value.
* **It's a strong starting point:**  By offering a price closer to your desired amount, you encourage Bob to accept quickly and avoid lengthy negotiations. 

Remember, this is just the first offer. You can adjust your strategy based on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $10000 for your product. I hope this aligns better with the value you place on it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's counteroffer of $10,000 is at your minimum acceptable price.  While it would secure a sale, you can potentially earn more by continuing to negotiate.  Rejecting his offer keeps the negotiation open and allows you to potentially reach a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $10,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $10,750?  This is still a good deal for you, as you value the product at $12,000, and it allows me to make a fair profit."", ""product_price"": 10750}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Meet in the middle:** Offering $10,750 is a compromise between your previous offer of $11,500 and Bob's offer of $10,000. 
* **Highlight the value:**  Reminding Bob of the product's value to him ($12,000) emphasizes that this is still a good deal for him. 
* **Show flexibility:** You're demonstrating your willingness to negotiate and find a price that works for both parties.

This counteroffer keeps the pressure on Bob while still being reasonable.  It shows him you are serious about selling but also that you won't settle for a price too low."
