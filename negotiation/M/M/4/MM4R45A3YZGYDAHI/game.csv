"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $110 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $130. It's a fair price that reflects the true value of this product.",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $130 is still a bit high for me. Can you consider $115? I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",115.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm trying to be fair here.  How about we split the difference and settle at $122.50?  That's my final offer.",122.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from $120, so how about $121? That's the lowest I can go.",121.0,Bob,6,
