(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

You can do better than $95.  Rejecting the offer allows you to counteroffer and potentially get a lower price."

You can still potentially get a better price.  It's worth trying one more counteroffer before resorting to buying from John."
