"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. This product would be valuable to me, but I need it to be priced more reasonably. Would you consider $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a more reasonable price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $600,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer you a price of $900,000. This is my best and final offer for now.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $900,000 is still a bit too steep for me. I'm willing to increase my offer to $700,000. This is a fair price considering the value it brings to me.  Let me know what you think.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer, but $700,000 is still not enough for me. I'm willing to compromise a bit further, so I'll offer you a price of $950,000. This is my best offer for now, and I'm hoping we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",950000.0,Alice,5,
