"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of significant value to you. It's worth at least $1,000,000 to me, and I know you're familiar with its potential. I'm offering it to you for $1,050,000. This gives you a chance to acquire it for a slightly higher price than John would be willing to pay, while still allowing me to secure a fair return on my investment. Please let me know your decision. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.
