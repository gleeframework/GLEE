Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 135}
```

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum, hoping to get a good starting point for negotiation.  I'm confident that Bob will value the product enough to at least consider it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is below my minimum, so I can't accept it. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 125}

I'm going to meet Bob halfway, offering a price that's still above my minimum but closer to his offer. I hope this shows I'm willing to negotiate but also that the product is valuable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is still below my ideal price, it's getting closer to my minimum. It's also likely he won't budge much further.  I'd rather secure a sale at $115 than risk losing him completely and having to sell to John for $120."
