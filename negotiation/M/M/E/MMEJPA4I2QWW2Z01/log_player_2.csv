"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for you, considering it's worth $12,000 to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $10,000 is a good deal compared to John's price, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! While I appreciate the deal, I'm hoping to get it for a bit less.  How about $9,500?  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:** Bob starts by offering a price that's still attractive to him, but significantly lower than Alice's initial offer. 
* **Negotiation Strategy:** By offering a counter-offer that's closer to Alice's perceived value ($8,000), Bob increases the likelihood of her accepting.
* **Positive Tone:**  The message remains friendly and emphasizes finding a price that works for both of them. This helps maintain a positive negotiation environment."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still looking to get closer to my asking price. How about $9,750? This is a fair price that considers both of our needs. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Progress:**  Alice has moved slightly closer to Bob's counteroffer, indicating she's willing to negotiate. 
* **Room for Improvement:** However, there's still room to negotiate.  Bob can still try to get a lower price.
* **Strategy:**  Rejecting this offer allows Bob to continue the negotiation and potentially secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $9,750 is still a bit too high for me. Let's split the difference and go with $9,625. This feels like a fair compromise that would allow us both to walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 9625}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** Bob is showing a willingness to meet Alice halfway, demonstrating his seriousness in reaching an agreement. 
* **Small Incremental Change:** The counter-offer is a smaller increment than the previous round, signaling that Bob is nearing his limit. 
* **Positive Framing:**  The message emphasizes a fair compromise and a mutually beneficial outcome, maintaining a positive tone."
