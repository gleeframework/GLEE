"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'd like to try to find a mutually beneficial price. What do you think?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $12,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $14,000?  It's still a good value for you and a fair price for me.  Let's close this deal.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the counteroffer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $13,500? It's a bit closer to your original offer, but I'm hoping we can find a sweet spot that works for both of us.",13500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm really trying to work with you here, but $13,500 is still just a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13,750. That's a fair price for both of us and gets us closer to a deal.  What do you say?",13750.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to come down to $13,750. However, I'm still a bit short on budget. Would you be willing to consider $13,500 again? It's the lowest I can go, but I'm really interested in making a deal with you. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",13500.0,Bob,6,
