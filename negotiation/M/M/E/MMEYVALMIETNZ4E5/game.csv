"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. As we're both aware, this product is worth $1,000,000 to you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000. I think this is a fair price considering the value it will bring to your life.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, I'm looking to invest a bit less. Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that you're looking to invest less, but I'm still confident that this product will bring significant value to your life. Considering your offer, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $950,000. This is a compromise that I believe is still fair, given the product's value to you.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a fair compromise, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not comfortable selling the product for $925,000. Considering the value it holds for you, I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $975,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",975000.0,Alice,5,
