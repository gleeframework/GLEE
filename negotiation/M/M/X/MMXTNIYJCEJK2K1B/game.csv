"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $11,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay at this time. I'm happy to offer you $9,500 for the product. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",9500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $9,500 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to compromise, however. I'll accept $10,250 for the product. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.  Let me know what you think.",10250.0,Alice,3,
