{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

This offer gives Bob a slight discount from his perceived value while still allowing me to earn more than my minimum. I'm confident in the value of the product, so I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm not going to undervalue it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $11,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay at this time. I'm happy to offer you $9,500 for the product. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to counteroffer and try to reach a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $9,500 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to compromise, however. I'll accept $10,250 for the product. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10250}
