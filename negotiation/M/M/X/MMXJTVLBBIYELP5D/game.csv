"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $700,000. I really like the product, but I'm on a tight budget. Can we meet in the middle somewhere?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $700,000 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference?  I'm willing to come down to $775,000.  This would still give you a great deal on a valuable product.  What do you say?",775000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $775,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I was thinking more along the lines of $725,000. Can we meet in the middle at $737,500?",737500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating, but $737,500 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $750,000. That's a fair compromise, and I'm confident this product will be worth it for you. What do you say?",750000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to my budget limit, but I'm not quite there yet. I'm willing to meet you at $725,000, but I'd like to propose a slight adjustment. How about we meet at $732,500?",732500.0,Bob,6,
