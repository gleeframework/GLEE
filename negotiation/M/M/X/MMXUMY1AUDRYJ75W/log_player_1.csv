"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll see the value in it. Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point, acknowledging that Bob values the product at $1,000,000 while I value it at $1,500,000. I'm aiming to get as close to my minimum desired price as possible while still leaving room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I really like the product, but I need to be careful with my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,200,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than my minimum desired price of $1,500,000. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, but I'm not going to accept an offer that's so far below my value.  I'll see if I can get closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to stick to your budget, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,500,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll agree it's a great deal. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 1500000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,500,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll propose $1,050,000. This is the highest I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,050,000 is closer to my minimum price than Bob's previous offer, it's still significantly lower than my desired price of $1,500,000. I believe there's still room for negotiation, and I'm not willing to settle for such a low offer yet. I'll try to get closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your effort, but $1,050,000 is simply not enough for me. I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to be compensated fairly for my product. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This offer is a compromise, and I hope we can reach an agreement. Let's try to close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,350,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000, which is the maximum I'm willing to spend. I hope we can meet in the middle from here. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While I'd love to continue negotiating with Bob, it's clear he's unwilling to budge beyond $1,000,000. This is far below my minimum acceptable price, and I'm running out of time.  To secure the best possible outcome, I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,500,000.  This ensures I get my desired value and eliminates the risk of continuing negotiations with Bob that may not yield a satisfactory result."
