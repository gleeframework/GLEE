"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I really like the product, but I need to be careful with my budget.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to stick to your budget, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,500,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll agree it's a great deal. Let's meet in the middle.",1500000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,500,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll propose $1,050,000. This is the highest I can go.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your effort, but $1,050,000 is simply not enough for me. I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to be compensated fairly for my product. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This offer is a compromise, and I hope we can reach an agreement. Let's try to close this deal.",1350000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,350,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000, which is the maximum I'm willing to spend. I hope we can meet in the middle from here.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
