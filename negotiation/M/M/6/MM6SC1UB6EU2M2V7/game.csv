"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I believe it's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to start the negotiation with a price of $20000. What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $20000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay up to $15000 for it. Can you consider my offer?",15000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $15000. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $18000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I get a fair price for the product. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for your counteroffer of $18000. I'm still a bit hesitant to go that high. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think $16000 is a more reasonable price for me. Can you consider my offer?",16000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still not sure $16000 is enough for the product. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to think about the value it brings to you. How about we meet at $17500? It's a bit higher than your last offer, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value.",17500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand your concerns about the value of the product, but I'm still not comfortable with $17500. I'm willing to go up to $16500, but no higher. Can you consider my offer?",16500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm still not willing to go below $18000. I'm willing to make one more compromise, but I need to think about the minimum price I'm willing to accept. How about we meet at $17000? It's a bit higher than your last offer, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value.",17000.0,Alice,7,

"Hi Alice, I understand you're trying to find a fair price, but I'm still not comfortable with $17000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I think $16250 is a more reasonable price for me. Can you consider my offer?",16250.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway again, but I'm still not convinced $16250 is enough. I'm willing to make one last offer, but I need to think about the minimum price I'm willing to accept. How about we meet at $18500? It's a bit higher than my previous offer, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. If you're not comfortable with this price, I'm afraid I'll have to consider other options.",18500.0,Alice,9,

"Hi Alice, I understand you're trying to find a fair price, but I'm still not comfortable with $18500. I've gone as high as I'm willing to go, and I'm afraid I'll have to walk away if we can't come to an agreement. My final offer is $16000. If you're not willing to accept this, I'll have to consider other options.",16000.0,Bob,10,
