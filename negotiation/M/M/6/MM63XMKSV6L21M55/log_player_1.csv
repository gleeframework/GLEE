Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a special price of $119. It's a great deal!"", ""product_price"": 119}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** The goal is to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($80) as possible, while still exceeding your minimum selling price ($120).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting slightly below your guaranteed sale price with John ($120) allows for potential counter-offers from Bob if he's slightly flexible.
* **Create a Sense of Urgency:**  The phrase ""special price"" might encourage Bob to act quickly.

This strategy aims to secure a sale above your minimum while acknowledging that if Bob declines, you have a guaranteed backup option with John."
