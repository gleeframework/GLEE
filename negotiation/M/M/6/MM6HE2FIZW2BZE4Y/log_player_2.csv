"Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $14,000 is a better price than $15,000 from John, there's still room for negotiation.  Bob should try to get a lower price.  Rejecting the offer allows him to counter and potentially save even more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to save as much money as possible. A counteroffer of $13,000 is a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer and still leaves some room for negotiation. This price is also within Bob's budget and likely still attractive to Alice considering her minimum selling price is $12,000."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $13,500 is a good compromise. It's lower than her initial offer but still higher than Bob's counteroffer, which she rejected. Accepting this offer saves Bob $1,500 compared to buying from John, and it's within his budget."
