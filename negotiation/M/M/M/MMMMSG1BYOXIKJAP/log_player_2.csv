{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Alice's first offer is above Bob's maximum budget.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming to get a substantial discount. This is a bold move, but it sets a clear expectation that Bob is serious about getting a good price. If Alice rejects this offer, Bob can adjust his offer in subsequent rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above Bob's maximum budget.  Bob should continue negotiating to try and get a better price.  If he accepts, he's still spending more than he wants. There's still a chance to get a better deal with Alice or go with John as a backup."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 775000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his offer slightly from the previous round. This shows Alice that he's willing to negotiate and move closer to her price, while still trying to save some money.  The offer is still below his maximum budget and allows for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $810,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $810,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his maximum price. There's still room for negotiation, and Bob can potentially get a better deal. Rejecting the offer allows him to make another counteroffer and see if Alice is willing to come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 790000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is now very close to his maximum budget. He's making a significant move towards Alice's price, but still trying to secure a slightly lower deal. If Alice rejects this offer, Bob is likely to accept her next offer, as he's running out of rounds and getting close to the price he's willing to pay."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $815,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $815,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above Bob's maximum budget. While time is running out, Bob can still try to negotiate a lower price. He is likely to accept Alice's next offer if it's below $800,000, but there's still a chance to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is now at his maximum budget and has only two rounds left. This is a final counteroffer, essentially challenging Alice to accept and finalize the deal. If Alice rejects, Bob will likely accept her next offer, if it's below his maximum price."
