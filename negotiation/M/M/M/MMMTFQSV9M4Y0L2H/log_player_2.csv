"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $12,000 for it. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $12,000 is less than John's price, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm looking to spend right now. How about $10,500? I'm really interested in the product, and this is my best offer."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. $10,500 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down a little. How about $11,500? This would be a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is lower than John's price:**  $11,500 is a better price than $15,000, which is Bob's fallback option.
* **Potential for further negotiation is limited:**  While Bob could try to counter-offer again, there's a risk Alice might stick to her price or even increase it.
* **Minimizing risk:** Accepting Alice's offer secures the product at a decent price and avoids the risk of a prolonged negotiation or having to pay John's higher price."
