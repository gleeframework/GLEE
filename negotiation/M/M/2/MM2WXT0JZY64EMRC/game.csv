"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $18,000. This is a great price, considering the value the product will bring to you.",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $18,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I have a limit of $10,000 in mind. Would you be willing to come down on the price?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $18,000 is a bit above your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $14,000. This is a fair price considering the value the product will bring to you.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  $14,000 is closer to what I had in mind, but it's still a bit of a stretch. Could you do $11,000? That would work much better for me.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $14,000 is still a bit above your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $11,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $13,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the value the product will bring to you.",13000.0,Alice,5,
