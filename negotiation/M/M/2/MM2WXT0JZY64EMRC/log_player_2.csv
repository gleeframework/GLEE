Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $14,000 is still a bit above your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $11,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $13,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the value the product will bring to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down in price, she's unlikely to go much lower than $13,000. You have a firm backup option with John at $12,000. It's not worth risking further negotiation with Alice when you can secure the product at your target price with John."
