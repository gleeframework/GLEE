"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm starting high, aiming for a good profit.  I'll see if Bob is willing to pay a premium.  If he rejects, I'll adjust my strategy based on his counteroffer.  I'm always prepared to walk away and sell to John if the negotiation doesn't lead to a satisfactory outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $750,000 is a decent offer, it's still below my minimum. I'm going to try to push for a better price in the next round. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer.  I'm not willing to sell to John yet as I still believe I can get more from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm going to compromise a bit by lowering my price, but I'm still aiming for a significant profit.  I'm confident that I can close the deal with Bob at this price. If he rejects again, I'll have to seriously consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob has finally offered my minimum price, which is the same as what John would pay.  While I'd like to get more, I don't want to risk losing this deal and ending up with nothing.  Accepting this offer secures my minimum profit and ensures a successful transaction."
