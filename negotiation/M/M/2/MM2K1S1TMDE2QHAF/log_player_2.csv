Given its value to you, I propose a price of $120 for it. This price reflects not only the cost of production but also the high value we place on customer satisfaction. I'm confident that you'll find this investment worthwhile. Please let me know if you have any questions or need more information. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer

**Explanation:**

While $120 is more than the product's worth to Alice ($80), it's still a better deal than buying from John for $150.  You save $30 by accepting Alice's offer."
