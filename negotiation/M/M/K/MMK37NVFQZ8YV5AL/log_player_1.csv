Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $750000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Considering the market value and my budget, I'd be willing to pay $700000 for the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000.
