"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I believe it's a game-changer and I think you'll love it. As we're both aware, the market value of this product is $800000. I'm willing to make a one-time offer to you, and I'm thinking of selling it to you for $750000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value and the effort I've put into it. What do you think?",750000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $750000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Considering the market value and my budget, I'd be willing to pay $700000 for the product. Let me know what you think.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of selling the product to you for $725000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and the effort I've put into it. What do you think?",725000.0,Alice,3,
