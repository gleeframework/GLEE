"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a little high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay closer to $1,000,000. What do you think?",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position. While I value the product highly, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000? This price still gives you a great deal, and it allows me to make a fair profit. Let me know what you think.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I'm still open to negotiating. While I'm willing to be flexible, $1,050,000 is a bit too low for me. Let's compromise at $1,075,000. It's a fair price that reflects the product's value and allows us both to reach an agreement. What do you think?",1075000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, you've been very reasonable, and I appreciate that.  I'm willing to go up slightly to $1,060,000.  I hope that works for you.",1060000.0,Bob,6,
