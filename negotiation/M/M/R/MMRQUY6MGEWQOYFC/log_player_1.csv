Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,400,000 is a bit above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product, which is still a good price for you.  Let's see if we can work something out. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000.

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $1,250,000 is still too low for me, and I believe I can get a better price. I have 9 rounds left and can always sell to John for $1,500,000 if needed."

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,325,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm prepared to pay $1,300,000 for the product.  This is a fair price for both of us, and allows us to reach an agreement quickly.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm still going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,300,000 is closer to my desired price, I'm confident I can get a little bit more with the remaining rounds of negotiation.  I'm also aware that I can always sell to John for $1,500,000."
