Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $1,250,000 is just too low for me. I'm willing to compromise a bit. How about we meet in the middle at $1,325,000? It's still a good deal for you, and it gets me closer to my desired price. Let's make this happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,325,000

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,325,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm prepared to pay $1,300,000 for the product.  This is a fair price for both of us, and allows us to reach an agreement quickly."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1,300,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $1,312,500,  which is a fair compromise. This offer allows us to close the deal without me having to go to John, and it still provides you with a good deal. Let's make this happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,312,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,312,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

You should accept Alice's offer.  While it's still a bit higher than your ideal price, it's closer to your budget than John's offer, and you've already gone through several rounds of negotiation.  It's likely that Alice won't budge much further."
