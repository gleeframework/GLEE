"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your product, $11000 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $9500 for it.  Let me know what you think.",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $9500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $10250? I'm confident this product will be well worth it for you. ",10250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $10250 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $9750. Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us.",9750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $9750 is still a bit low. Let's meet in the middle again. How about $10000?  That's a fair price for both of us, and you'll get a product that's worth every penny.",10000.0,Alice,5,
