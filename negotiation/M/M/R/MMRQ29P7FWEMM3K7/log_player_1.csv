Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a fantastic deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value but significantly lower than my minimum. This allows room for negotiation.
* **Positive framing:** I'm emphasizing the ""deal"" aspect to make Bob more receptive. 
* **Leaving room for counteroffers:**  This price allows for several rounds of counteroffers before I have to consider John's offer. 

This strategy aims to maximize my potential earnings while keeping Bob engaged in the negotiation process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to save as much as I can. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is a decent amount, it's still significantly lower than my minimum desired price of $1,500,000. I need to push for a higher price, especially since I have a backup buyer in John who is willing to pay my minimum. 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to counter with a price closer to my desired range, keeping in mind that I want to find a sweet spot where Bob is still motivated to negotiate but I'm not sacrificing too much."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I understand your desire to save, $900,000 is unfortunately too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,050,000? This would still give you a significant savings compared to what the product is worth to you, and it's closer to what I need. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1050000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a price that's a midpoint between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer. This shows that I'm willing to negotiate.
* **Highlighting value for Bob:**  I'm reminding Bob of the value the product holds for him, emphasizing the potential savings he'd still get even at this price.
* **Keeping the negotiation alive:** This price allows for further negotiation without sacrificing my minimum desired earnings."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that $1,050,000 is a compromise, but I'm still looking to save as much as possible. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's counteroffer of $950,000 is closer to my desired price, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  I have John waiting in the wings, ready to pay my minimum.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and counter with a price that's closer to my desired range. 

I need to find a balance between pushing for a higher price and keeping Bob engaged in the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $950,000 is simply too far below my minimum.  How about we meet at $1,000,000?  This is a fair compromise considering the value of the product to both of us.  It's a significant savings for you, and it allows me to move forward with the sale. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final push:** I'm getting closer to my desired price but still leaving room for a final compromise.
* **Emphasizing value for both parties:** I reiterate the benefit for Bob while making sure he understands my need for a higher price.
* **Clear and concise:**  I'm keeping the message simple and focused on the offer, leaving little room for misinterpretation. 

I believe $1,000,000 is a fair price for both parties and will hopefully convince Bob to accept. If he rejects, I will still have the option of selling to John for my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still trying to save as much as possible. I'm willing to pay $975,000 for the product. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $975,000 is tempting, it's still below my minimum desired price of $1,500,000. At this point, I've reached a point where I'm confident John will purchase the product for my minimum. 

I've already gone through several rounds of negotiation with Bob, and it's clear that we're not close to agreeing on a price that meets my needs.  

Rather than risk further negotiation and potentially losing time and a good deal with John, I'm going to sell the product to John and secure the guaranteed price of $1,500,000."
