(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While I understand he's trying to negotiate,  $600,000 is significantly below the product's value to me. I'm willing to negotiate, but not at that price."

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  $750,000 is still too low for me, especially since John is willing to pay $1,000,000. I'm not willing to sell for that price. I'll make a counteroffer to see if we can bridge the gap."
