,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I understand your perspective, $105 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $110. This price still gives you a good deal, and it's a fair compromise. Let me know if you're interested.",110.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your position, but I'm still not comfortable going below $109. It's a fair price considering the value of the product to you.  If we can agree on this, we can close the deal. Let me know what you think.",109.0,Alice,5,
