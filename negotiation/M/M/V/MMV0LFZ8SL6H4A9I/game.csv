"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1200000 is still a bit lower than I can accept.  I'm willing to come down a little further, but I need at least $1350000 to make this worthwhile. This price is a fair compromise, and I believe it still reflects the product's value. What do you think?",1350000.0,Alice,3,
