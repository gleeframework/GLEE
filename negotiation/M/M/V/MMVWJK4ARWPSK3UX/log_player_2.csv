"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on this amazing item. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value it brings to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

``` 

While Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is less than its value to her, it's more than your maximum price and what John offers. Rejecting her offer allows you to proceed with purchasing from John at a better price."
