Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  $1,200,000 is still a good deal for Bob, as he values the product at $1,000,000. 
* **It's below your minimum:**  $1,200,000 is above your minimum price of $1,500,000, but it leaves room for negotiation.
* **It shows you're open to negotiation:** The message emphasizes that you're looking for a deal that works for both of you.

This approach allows for a potential negotiation while still keeping your options open. If Bob rejects your offer, you can counter-offer or move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. Would you be willing to meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Bob's offer is below my minimum price of $1,500,000.  While I'm open to negotiation, I'm not willing to settle for a price that's significantly lower than my minimum.  I'll counter-offer and see if we can find a middle ground.  If Bob continues to lowball me, I'll move on to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,100,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but $1,150,000 is my final offer.  This still gives you a good price, and it's a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
``` 
 
I'm counter-offering at $1,150,000. This is still above Bob's perceived value, but it's closer to my minimum price. The message emphasizes that I'm willing to compromise, but I'm not going any lower.  This approach allows for a potential agreement while still protecting my interests."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $1,050,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,050,000 is still far below my minimum price of $1,500,000.  It's clear we're not going to reach an agreement.  Since John is willing to pay my minimum price, I'm going to sell the product to him and avoid further negotiation with Bob."
