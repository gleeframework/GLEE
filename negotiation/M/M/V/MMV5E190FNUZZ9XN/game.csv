"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. That initial price is a little high for me. I'm thinking something closer to $800,000 would be more reasonable. What do you think?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but $800,000 undervalues the true potential of this product. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to see a price that reflects its worth. How about we meet halfway at $1,650,000?",1650000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer, but that's still a bit too high for my budget.  I can go up to $1,000,000, which I believe is a fair offer.  This is my final offer.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming up on the price. I understand this is a significant investment for you. I'm willing to accept a slight reduction to $1,450,000.  This offer reflects the product's true value while acknowledging your position.  Let me know what you think.",1450000.0,Alice,5,
