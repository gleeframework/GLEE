"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this fantastic product.  Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000.  I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations."",
""product_price"": 2300000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Anchor:** Starting with a significantly higher price than Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000) and even my minimum ($1,500,000) sets a strong anchor. This gives me room to negotiate downwards while still aiming for a final price well above my minimum.
* **Justification:**  Vaguely mentioning ""value and potential"" provides a semblance of justification for the high price without revealing specific details. 
* **Open to Negotiation:**  Clearly stating this is a ""starting point for negotiations"" signals to Bob that I'm willing to be flexible and find a mutually agreeable price.

This strategy aims to maximize my potential profit while leaving room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. That initial price is a little high for me. I'm thinking something closer to $800,000 would be more reasonable. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $800,000 is significantly below both my minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000) and his own perceived value ($1,000,000). Accepting this offer would be a substantial loss. While selling to John is always an option, there's still room for negotiation with Bob. I'll aim to steer the price closer to his perceived value in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but $800,000 undervalues the true potential of this product. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to see a price that reflects its worth. How about we meet halfway at $1,650,000?"",
""product_price"": 1650000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledging Bob's Offer:** Showing I've considered his proposal keeps the negotiation collaborative, even if his offer was far too low.
* **Reiterating Value:** Without explicitly saying ""no,"" I'm subtly reminding Bob that I'm aware the product is worth more than he's offering.
* **Significant but Justified Concession:**  Moving from $2,300,000 to $1,650,000 is a large drop, signaling flexibility on my part. Framing it as ""meeting halfway"" makes it seem like a fair compromise, even though it's closer to my initial price than his.
* **Aiming High:**  While still above my minimum, this counteroffer leaves room for further negotiation if needed while pushing for a price significantly above Bob's initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer, but that's still a bit too high for my budget.  I can go up to $1,000,000, which I believe is a fair offer.  This is my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has now reached his perceived value of the product. While it's tempting to accept and make a profit, I believe there's still some room for negotiation.  He's using the ""final offer"" tactic, which often signals some willingness to budge. I'll make a smaller concession to test the waters."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up on the price. I understand this is a significant investment for you. I'm willing to accept a slight reduction to $1,450,000.  This offer reflects the product's true value while acknowledging your position.  Let me know what you think."",
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Appreciation:** I want to keep the tone positive and acknowledge Bob's effort in moving closer to my price range. 
* **Smaller Concession:**  Dropping only $200,000 this round signals that I'm reaching my lower limit. 
* **Finality:** While not explicitly a ""final offer,"" the tone and smaller concession imply this is a serious offer, encouraging Bob to consider it carefully.
* **Above Reserve:**  This price still provides a substantial profit margin over my minimum ($1,500,000), leaving the John option open if needed."
