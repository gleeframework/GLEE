"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,500,000. This is a significant premium over my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  I want to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to pay a high price. If he rejects, I'll be prepared to adjust my offer based on his counteroffer.  I also have the option of selling to John for $1,000,000 if I feel the negotiation with Bob is not going well."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While I'm happy with the $1,000,000 offer,  I believe there's room for a better price. I'll reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer. This will allow me to explore if there's a middle ground we can reach."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
``` 

I'm lowering my offer to $1,250,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, but still a substantial amount for Bob. I'm hoping this counteroffer will encourage Bob to come closer to my price point. This offer shows a willingness to negotiate, while still protecting my interests.  If Bob rejects this offer, I'll have to seriously consider selling to John as the negotiation may be becoming too time-consuming."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer of $900,000 is tempting, I'm still holding out for a better deal.  I'm going to reject this offer and make a counteroffer, hoping to meet somewhere in the middle.  I'm  aware of John's offer of $1,000,000, but I'm determined to see if I can get a higher price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

I'm lowering my offer again to $1,100,000. This is a compromise from my previous offer, but still significantly higher than Bob's last offer.  I'm hopeful that Bob will recognize the value of the product and be willing to meet me halfway. If he continues to refuse, I'll have to seriously consider selling to John, as I'm running out of time and negotiating room."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,000,000.  Bob's offer of $800,000 is getting too low for me.  While I still believe I could potentially negotiate a better price with Bob,  I've already spent several rounds trying to reach a compromise.  I'm concerned that continuing this negotiation could take too long and ultimately result in an even lower offer from Bob. Selling to John guarantees a quick and secure transaction at a reasonable price."
