"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. It's something truly special, and I believe it has immense value to you. My initial offer is $1,200,000.  I'm confident this is a fair price given the product's worth. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1200000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my previous offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but I believe we can find a price that works for both of us. How about offering the product for $950,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  $950,000 is too low for me, especially since the product is worth $1,000,000 to him. I have 9 more rounds to try and get a better price, so I'm not going to settle for that yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to negotiate. However,  $950,000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product. Let's meet in the middle.  I'm willing to drop my price to $1,100,000.  This is a fair price that considers your interests while still allowing me to make a profit. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1100000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of the product, but I am still not comfortable with $1,100,000. I would like to propose an offer of $1,050,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that respects both our interests. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  $1,050,000 is a good price and is better than selling to John for $1,000,000.  It's also a fair compromise with Bob, and I'm happy to close the deal."
