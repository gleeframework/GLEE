Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand you're looking for a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $80. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $115. Let me know if that's more to your liking!

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. However, $97.50 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to meet my minimum of $120. How about we meet at $110? That's as low as I can go. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

It's unlikely Alice will go below $110, and it's not worth risking paying more than the $100 John is offering."
