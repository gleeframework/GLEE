"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum acceptable value to leave room for negotiation.
* **Leaving Room for Compromise:**  $1,200,000 is still lower than John's offer of $1,000,000, so I can potentially lower the price if necessary to secure a deal with Bob.
* **Being Clear and Friendly:** The message is straightforward and friendly to encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,200,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering my maximum budget and the value of the product to me. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $850,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value of $1,000,000.
* **Potential for a better deal:** While I could sell to John now for $1,000,000, there's still potential to get closer to my desired price of $1,200,000 by continuing to negotiate with Bob.
* **Strategic maneuvering:** Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to control the negotiation and make a counteroffer that is more advantageous to me in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $850,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This reflects the value of the product and gives us both a good deal.  Let's see if we can agree on this."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a price that's lower than my initial offer but still higher than my minimum acceptable value, showing a willingness to compromise.
* **Staying Firm:**  I'm not willing to go lower than $1,000,000 right now, but this offer leaves room for further negotiation if needed.
* **Reiterating Value:** I remind Bob of the value of the product to emphasize why my offer is fair."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,050,000 is still outside my comfort zone.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $900,000.  This is a significant increase from my previous offer and represents a fair compromise. Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:** $900,000 is still below my minimum acceptable value of $1,000,000.
* **Closing the gap:** While Bob's offer is closer to my desired price, there's still potential to secure a better deal.
* **Negotiation strategy:** Rejecting his offer keeps the negotiation going and gives me control to make a counteroffer that potentially pushes him closer to my price. 
* **Avoiding selling to John:** Selling to John for $1,000,000 would be a safe option, but I want to see if I can get a higher price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find a middle ground. While $900,000 is closer, I'm still a bit away from my target.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This feels like a fair compromise, given the value of the product. Let's try to close this deal."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:**  My offer of $950,000 is a middle ground between Bob's offer of $900,000 and my previous offer of $1,050,000. 
* **Close to minimum:** This price is close to my minimum acceptable value of $1,000,000, but still leaves room for a possible counteroffer from Bob.
* **Emphasizing fairness:** I highlight the compromise and the value of the product to encourage Bob to accept. 
* **Moving towards a deal:**  This offer demonstrates my willingness to negotiate and reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you continuing to negotiate with me. While $950,000 is closer, I'm still hoping to find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to go up to $925,000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer and shows my commitment to reaching an agreement. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product for both of us. Let's make this deal happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below target:** $925,000 is still below my minimum acceptable value of $1,000,000.
* **Negotiation strategy:**  Rejecting Bob's offer gives me control to make a counteroffer that might nudge him closer to my desired price. 
* **Not yet a good enough deal:**  While we're getting close, I'm not willing to accept a price that's lower than what I consider fair for the product's value.
* **Time for a final push:** With only 4 rounds left, I want to see if I can get a better offer from Bob before potentially selling to John."

Round 7

{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting close! I appreciate your persistence, and I'm willing to make one final concession.  I can do $940,000. This is a very fair price, considering the value of the product.  Let's close this deal, and both of us can walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 940000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** This is my final offer before potentially accepting John's offer. I'm willing to go slightly lower than my minimum acceptable value to close the deal.
