{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's final offer of $940,000 is still above my target price of $800,000.  While it's closer than before, I don't want to risk going further and potentially reaching a deal that's too expensive. It's best to stick to my initial plan and buy from John at $800,000, ensuring I stay within my budget and avoid unnecessary risk in the negotiation."
