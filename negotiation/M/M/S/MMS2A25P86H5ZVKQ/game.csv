"Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you.  It's something I've put a lot of effort into and I'm confident it can make a real impact in your business. I'm offering it to you for $900,000, which is significantly less than what it's worth to me.  This is a limited-time opportunity, so let me know if you're interested. ",900000.0,Alice,1,
