"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. With that said, I'm willing to make a serious offer. I'm looking to sell it to you for $950,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I recognize the value of the product, $950,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this stage. I'm prepared to offer $750,000. This price reflects the value I see in the product and allows for a fair profit margin for both of us.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $850,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $850,000 is closer to my ideal price, I'm still aiming for a bit lower.  Let's split the difference - I'm offering $800,000.  This price would be a fair compromise and allow us both to achieve our goals.",800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a compromise, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $800,000. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. I'll sell the product to you for $825,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",825000.0,Alice,5,
