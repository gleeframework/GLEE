"Hi Bob, I'm offering my product to you for $14000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below what it's worth to me and still offers you a good value. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $14000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $12500 for the product. Let me know what you think.",12500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position. While I can't go as low as $12500, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $13250?  It's a fair price for both of us and allows us to close this deal.",13250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $13250 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'm willing to go up to $13000. This is my final offer, as I can always buy from John for $12000.",13000.0,Bob,4,
