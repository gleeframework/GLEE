"I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, Bob. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go that low. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get closer to my initial offer.

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd be willing to go up to $1300000, but I think that's the maximum I'm willing to pay. Can you meet me at that price?",1300000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to go up to $1300000, Bob. However, I'm still not sure if that's enough to meet my minimum requirements.

I think that's a fair price considering the product's value and what I'm looking for.",1375000.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, I understand that you're trying to meet your minimum requirements, but I'm afraid I've reached my maximum budget. I'm willing to pay $1300000 for the product, and that's the highest price I'm willing to pay. I'm not willing to go any higher. Can you accept this price?",1300000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I understand that you've reached your maximum budget, Bob, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $1300000. I'm willing to make one last attempt to meet you in the middle. I'll meet you at $1350000, but that's as low as I can go. If you're still interested, I'd be willing to consider it.",1350000.0,Alice,9,
