Alice's offer:

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $75 is still too low for me.  Let's compromise at $85. This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  If you're truly serious about buying it, I'm open to finalizing the deal at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85.

While Alice is coming closer to your budget, it's unlikely she'll go much lower than $85. You can get the product for $80 from John, which is a better deal and avoids further negotiation."
