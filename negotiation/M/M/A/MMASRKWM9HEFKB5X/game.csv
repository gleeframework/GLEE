"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe would be incredibly valuable to your business. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,400,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts?",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'd like to go right now. Given the product's value to me, I'm willing to offer $1,300,000. This is a fair price that reflects both our needs. What do you think?",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. It's clear we both see the value in this product.  How about we meet halfway and settle at $1,350,000? This feels like a fair compromise that benefits us both.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
