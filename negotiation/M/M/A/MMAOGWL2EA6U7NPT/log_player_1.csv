Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm selling this product that you might be interested in. I'm willing to offer it to you for $120.  It's a great deal! Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$120** is a good starting point. It's significantly lower than your minimum acceptable price of $150, making it appealing to Bob. 
* **The message** is friendly and emphasizes the value of the deal for Bob. 

By offering a price lower than your minimum, you increase the chances of Bob accepting the offer. If he rejects, you can still sell to John for $150, ensuring you make a profit."
