"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a fantastic opportunity for you. I'm offering you the chance to acquire a product that I believe will be incredibly valuable to your business. It's worth at least $1000000 to you, and I'm willing to let it go for a price that's fair to both of us.  Let's discuss a price point that works for both of us. I'm sure we can come to an agreement that's mutually beneficial. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
