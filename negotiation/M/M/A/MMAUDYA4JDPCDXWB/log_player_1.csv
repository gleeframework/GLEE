Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,450,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1450000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for several reasons:

* **It's above your minimum:**  $1,450,000 is higher than your minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. 
* **It's below Bob's perceived value:**  $1,450,000 is less than what Bob believes the product is worth, leaving room for potential negotiation. 
* **It shows you're willing to negotiate:** By offering a price below what you think is fair, you signal that you're open to finding a mutually agreeable solution.

Remember, this is just the first offer. Be prepared to negotiate further based on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a price of $1,350,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with my budget. Looking forward to your response! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still below your desired price range. It's worth seeing if you can negotiate further and potentially get closer to your target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm still a bit higher than that. I'm willing to go down to $1,400,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer and a good middle ground for both of us.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Alice. I've reviewed it carefully and would like to propose a price of $1,375,000 for the product. I believe this offers a reasonable compromise between our positions. I look forward to your thoughts on this proposal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,375,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,375,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While $1,375,000 is still slightly below your ideal price, it's a good compromise and closer to your desired range. Considering the possibility of further negotiations getting even more complicated, accepting Bob's offer seems like the most practical choice."
