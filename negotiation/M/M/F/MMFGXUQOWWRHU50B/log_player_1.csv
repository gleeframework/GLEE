I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,500,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000, but it gives Bob an opportunity to get a great deal while still leaving me with a profit. 

It's important to remember that I have a guaranteed sale with John at $1,200,000, so I'm not under pressure to sell to Bob at a lower price. This strategy allows me to potentially maximize my profit while also giving Bob a chance to purchase the product."
