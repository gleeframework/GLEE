"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. After considering your proposal, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $13500. It's a bit higher than your offer, but I think it's still a fair compromise considering the product's value. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your perspective on the value of the product.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $13500 is still slightly more than I'm comfortable spending.  Let's try $13000.  This would be a fair compromise for both of us. ",13000.0,Bob,4,
