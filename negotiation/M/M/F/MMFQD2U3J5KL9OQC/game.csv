"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but that price is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1,000,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $1,250,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the value it brings to you.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thanks for being flexible.  While $1,250,000 is closer, it's still a touch above what I have budgeted. How about we settle at $1,125,000? ",1125000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we might not meet in the middle, Bob. However, I'm still willing to work with you. I can offer you a slight discount, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving too much money on the table. I'm now offering the product to you for $1,200,000. This is my final concession, and I hope we can agree on this price.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
