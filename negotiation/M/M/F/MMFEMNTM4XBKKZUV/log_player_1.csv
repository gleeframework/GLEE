"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $140. It's a great deal for both of us! Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price that's higher than my minimum, but still leaves some room for negotiation. This should hopefully encourage Bob to make a counteroffer, allowing us to find a mutually beneficial price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $130. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $130 is better than my minimum, I think I can still get a slightly higher price.  I'll try to meet him halfway in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $130 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and meet at $135?  It's a fair price for both of us, and we can close the deal!"", ""product_price"": 135}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that you're trying to find a fair price, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $135. Would you be willing to meet me at $132? I think that's a more reasonable price for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $132. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $132
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

At this point, Bob has come up to $132. This is a good price considering my minimum is $120 and I can always sell to John for that price.  It's time to close the deal and avoid risking further negotiation."
