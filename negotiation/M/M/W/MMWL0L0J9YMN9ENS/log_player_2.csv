"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm offering it to you for $115. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $115 is better than $120, Bob can likely get a better deal by negotiating.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate it, I'm only looking to spend $100 on this product. Would you be willing to consider that price?"", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $100 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to make at least $110 on this. How about we split the difference and settle on $105? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is a good compromise:** Alice has come down from $115 to $105, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate. 
* **Bob's target price is $100, but $105 is still a good deal:**  The difference between $105 and $100 is less than the potential gains from further negotiation.
* **Risk of further negotiation:**  There's a risk that Alice might reject another counteroffer, or that the negotiations could go on for longer. 

While $100 is Bob's ideal,  accepting Alice's offer at $105 is a smart decision, securing the product at a reasonable price while avoiding the uncertainty of continued negotiation."
