{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject the offer.  While it's lower than John's price, there's still room for negotiation.  Bob can aim for a price closer to Alice's value of $8,000 to maximize his savings."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is offering $8,500, which is halfway between Alice's value of $8,000 and Bob's maximum of $10,000. This is a reasonable starting point for negotiation, giving Alice some room to counter while still saving Bob significant money compared to John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob should again reject Alice's offer.  While it's lower than John's price, and closer to Bob's target, it's still higher than what Alice is willing to accept. Bob can try to push for a lower price, hoping to get closer to Alice's value of $8,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8750} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is offering $8,750. This is a slight increase from his previous offer, acknowledging that Alice is likely not willing to accept $8,500.  However, it's still significantly lower than Alice's current offer of $9,000, and closer to Alice's value of $8,000.  This strategy aims to find a middle ground for a mutually agreeable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  It's a fair price, considering that Alice is willing to go down to $8,900, and it's still much lower than John's price of $10,000.  While Bob might be able to negotiate further, the risk of Alice walking away and Bob having to buy from John at a higher price is not worth it."
