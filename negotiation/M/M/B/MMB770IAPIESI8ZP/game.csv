"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. Can you consider my counteroffer?",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $1,200,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000.  This is a significant compromise from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product to you.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I'm really trying to work with you here, but $1,250,000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $1,300,000, which is closer to your offer. It's a fair price considering the product's value to you and my need to earn a reasonable profit.  Let's close this deal.",1300000.0,Alice,5,
