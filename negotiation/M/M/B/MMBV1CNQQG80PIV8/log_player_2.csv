Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial price. This is a bold move, but I'm trying to establish a starting point for negotiation. I'm aiming to meet in the middle eventually.  It's also important to be mindful of the 10-round limit, so it's better to start aggressively."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Explanation:**

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is getting very close to my budget, but I'm still hesitant to accept.  There are only three rounds left, and I'm confident I can negotiate a price closer to my goal of $1,000,000. I'm going to try one last counteroffer to see if we can reach an agreement."

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm making my final counteroffer at $1,000,000, which is my absolute maximum. This is a risky move, but I believe it's my best chance to get the product within my budget. If Alice rejects this offer, I can always buy from John for the same price. With only two rounds remaining, it's time to go all in."

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
