This initial offer starts high, aiming to get a good starting point in the negotiation. It also acknowledges the potential value to Bob while still leaving room for bargaining."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer is a bit too high for my budget. I'm interested in this product, but I'm only willing to pay $900000. This is my best offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is significantly lower than my ideal price, it's still above my minimum.  I'm going to reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but unfortunately, $900,000 is just not a viable price for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to at least get $1,200,000 for this product.  I'm confident it's a great investment for you, and I'm ready to work with you to make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price.  $1200000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1050000, but that's my absolute limit. If you're serious about making a deal, I'm ready to finalize it now. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,050,000 is close to my minimum acceptable price and  better than selling to John for $1,000,000.  It's time to close this deal!"
