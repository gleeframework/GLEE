"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $130 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  I'd be happy to pay $115.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'll reject Bob's offer. While $115 is better than nothing, I'm hoping to get closer to my desired price. I'll try a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $115 is a bit low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $125? It's still a great deal for you, and I'm happy to compromise."", ""product_price"": 125}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your perspective, but $125 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. How about we split the difference and go with $120?  This is the absolute most I'm willing to pay. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $120 is my minimum acceptable price.  I'd rather not risk further negotiation and potentially lose the sale."
