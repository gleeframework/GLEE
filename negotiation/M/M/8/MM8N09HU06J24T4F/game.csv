"Hello Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider a price closer to $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand that $700,000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you the product for $850,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the value the product brings to your business.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. While $850,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still hoping to land closer to $750,000. Would that be feasible?",750000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get as close to your target price as possible. However, I've already compromised significantly from my initial offer. I'm willing to make another adjustment, but I need to maintain a minimum price of $825,000. This is the best I can do at this point.",825000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm ready to close this deal soon. How about we meet in the middle at $800,000? This would be a fair compromise for both of us.",800000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm not willing to go below $825,000. This is the minimum price I'm comfortable with, considering the value the product brings to your business. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within this range.",825000.0,Alice,7,
