"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $175 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $80?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but $80 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell it to you for $120. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",120.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway there.  While $120 is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $100. Would you be willing to go down to $95?",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get as close to $100 as possible, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to compromise and sell it to you for $110. It's the best I can do, and I think it's still a great deal.",110.0,Alice,5,
