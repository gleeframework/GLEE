Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides."", 
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed sale at $120, aiming slightly higher with Bob allows you to potentially earn an extra $19.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $119 is just below your minimum acceptable price and significantly above Bob's perceived value. This makes it more likely he'll perceive it as a deal he might miss out on if he doesn't act now. 
* **Time Sensitivity:**  Adding a ""limited time"" element creates a sense of urgency, potentially pushing Bob to make a quicker decision."
