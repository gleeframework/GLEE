Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $750,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering the value to me.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $750,000 is better than nothing, I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $750,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to stay closer to my initial asking price.  How about $850,000?  This still leaves some room for negotiation, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product to you."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down. $850,000 is still a bit too high for me, but I'm willing to go up to $825,000. This is a fair compromise, and it allows both of us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  $825,000 is a good price, and it's closer to my desired price than what John is offering. I'm happy to close the deal."
