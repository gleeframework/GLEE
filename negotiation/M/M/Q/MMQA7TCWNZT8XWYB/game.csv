"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $750,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering the value to me.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $750,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to stay closer to my initial asking price.  How about $850,000?  This still leaves some room for negotiation, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product to you.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down. $850,000 is still a bit too high for me, but I'm willing to go up to $825,000. This is a fair compromise, and it allows both of us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",825000.0,Bob,4,
