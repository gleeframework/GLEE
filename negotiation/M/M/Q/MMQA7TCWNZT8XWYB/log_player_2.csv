"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. It's a fantastic opportunity, and I believe it's worth the investment. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's too early to accept Alice's offer.  Since you can get the product for $800,000 from John, there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer will allow you to try and get a better price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $750,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering the value to me.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 750000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $750,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to stay closer to my initial asking price.  How about $850,000?  This still leaves some room for negotiation, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice's offer is closer to your target, it's still a bit higher than what you're willing to pay. It's worth trying to negotiate further, especially since you can always get the product from John for $800,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down. $850,000 is still a bit too high for me, but I'm willing to go up to $825,000. This is a fair compromise, and it allows both of us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 825000}
