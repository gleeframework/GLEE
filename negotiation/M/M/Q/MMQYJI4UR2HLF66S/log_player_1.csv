Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking of a price more around $1,200,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the market value of similar products. I'm willing to negotiate further to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a price of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the market value and the unique advantages of the product.

{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is holding firm at $1,200,000. It seems unlikely he will go much higher. However, we still have room to negotiate above John's offer.  Let's see if we can push Bob a bit further."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find a compromise. Let's try to bridge the gap.  Would you consider $1,275,000?  This represents a significant investment on your part, but I believe the value you'll gain from the product far exceeds this price."",

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your persistence, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to compromise further and propose a price of $1,175,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and the unique advantages of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,175,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,175,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**  While we still have room to negotiate above John's offer, Bob has consistently moved upwards in his offers. Accepting at $1,175,000 secures a significant profit above our minimum and avoids the risk of Bob lowering his offer in subsequent rounds."
