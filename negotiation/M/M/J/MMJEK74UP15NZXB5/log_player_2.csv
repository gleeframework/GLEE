"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this exceptional product, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire it at a fair price. I'm willing to start with an offer of $1,100,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. While $1,100,000 is a good starting point, there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm interested in the product, but I'm looking to spend closer to $950,000.  Let's see if we can find a compromise."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to spend closer to $950,000, but I have to consider the product's value to me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $1,025,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible. He's already negotiated Alice down to $1,025,000, which is closer to his goal of $950,000.  By rejecting the offer, Bob can try to push for a lower price and see if Alice is willing to come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  While $1,025,000 is closer, I'm still hoping to land closer to my initial offer.  Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to pay $987,500.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 987500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $1,012,500. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to me and the value you've placed on it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,012,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,012,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob has successfully negotiated the price down from Alice's initial offer of $1,100,000 to $1,012,500. While he might still be able to push for a slightly lower price, it's likely that Alice will be unwilling to go much lower than this. Accepting the offer at $1,012,500 saves Bob $87,500 compared to buying from John and keeps the negotiation moving forward. It's a good deal for both parties."
