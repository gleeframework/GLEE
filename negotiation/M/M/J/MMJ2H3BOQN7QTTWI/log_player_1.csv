Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $115."", 
""product_price"": 115
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Starting with an offer closer to Bob's maximum valuation ($120) allows me to potentially secure a higher profit margin.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The $115 price tag leaves some space for Bob to potentially counteroffer,  keeping the negotiation open. 
* **Alternative Option:** I'm aware I can sell to John for $100, acting as a safety net if negotiations with Bob don't go as planned."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product but $115 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $105? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $105 is closer to my minimum, I know Bob values the product at $120. There's still room to negotiate a better price. I'm willing to push a little further before settling or resorting to John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate your offer, Bob. I'm willing to come down a bit, how about we meet in the middle at $110?"",
""product_price"": 110
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Conceding Ground:**  By moving down to $110, I acknowledge Bob's counteroffer and show willingness to negotiate.
* **Meeting in the Middle:** This classic negotiation tactic often feels fair to both parties. It positions the compromise price as a win-win.
* **Maintaining Profit Margin:** $110 is still a good profit above my minimum, and it keeps us closer to Bob's perceived value than his initial counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're trying to find a fair price, Alice. How about we settle at $108? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $108
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Diminishing Returns:**  Continuing to negotiate might only yield a few more dollars. The time and effort involved in further back-and-forth aren't worth the potential gain. 
* **Reasonable Profit:** Accepting $108 still provides a decent profit margin over my minimum ($100) and John's offer. 
* **Securing the Sale:** There's always a risk Bob could walk away if I push too hard. Accepting his offer ensures a sale and avoids losing him as a customer."
