Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a possible offer, considering Alice's position:

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000.  I believe this reflects its true worth and the benefits it will bring you."", 
""product_price"": 1200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Alice knows Bob values the product at $800,000 and has a guaranteed sale at that price. Starting significantly higher allows room for negotiation and maximizes potential profit.
* **Justification for the Price:**  The message emphasizes ""unique value"" and ""potential,"" subtly suggesting the price is justified without revealing Alice's true minimum.
* **Exclusivity Tactic:**  By framing it as an ""exclusive opportunity,"" Alice creates a sense of scarcity and desirability, potentially making Bob more inclined to accept a higher price.

**Important Note:** This is a starting point. Alice should be prepared to negotiate with Bob. If Bob makes a counteroffer significantly lower than $1,200,000, Alice can gradually decrease the price, knowing she has the safety net of John's offer."
