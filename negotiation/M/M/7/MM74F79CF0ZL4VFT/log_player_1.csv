"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm asking for $100 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price of $100, which is above my minimum but leaves room for negotiation.  
* **Open to Negotiation:** Emphasizing my willingness to negotiate shows flexibility and encourages Bob to counteroffer. 
* **Value Proposition:** Briefly mentioning the product's value (without revealing its worth to Bob) can pique his interest.

This strategy aims to maximize my earnings while keeping the negotiation open for a potential better outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm really interested in the product, but $100 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. Would you be willing to do $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value to Bob:** Bob's offer of $90 is still significantly below the product's value to him ($120), indicating there's room for further negotiation.
* **My Minimum:** While $90 is higher than my minimum of $80, I can potentially get closer to the product's true value by continuing the negotiation.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Selling to John for $80 is guaranteed, but the potential to earn more by continuing the negotiation with Bob outweighs the risk of losing the deal.

**Next Round Strategy:**

In the next round, I will make a counteroffer, likely somewhere between $90 and $100, depending on Bob's responsiveness and my assessment of his willingness to pay."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer.  While I'm open to negotiation, $90 is a bit too low for me at this point. I'm willing to come down to $95. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer:** My counter-offer is a compromise, showing flexibility while still staying above Bob's offer. 
* **Reasoning:**  Providing a reason for my counter-offer (""too low"") adds a bit more weight to my position.
* **Openness:** I reiterate my willingness to negotiate, encouraging further back-and-forth.

**Strategy:**

* This counter-offer attempts to find a middle ground while keeping the negotiation moving.  
* If Bob accepts, I've secured a good price.  
* If he rejects, I can assess his further offers and adjust my own strategy accordingly."
