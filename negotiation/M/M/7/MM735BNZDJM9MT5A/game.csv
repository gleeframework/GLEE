"Thanks for the offer, Alice. It's a great product, but $120 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $90 for it. What do you think?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $90 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer it to you for $110. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, but I think it's still a great deal for this amazing product.",110.0,Alice,3,

,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $95 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $105. This is my final compromise, but I think it's still a great deal for this amazing product.",105.0,Alice,5,
