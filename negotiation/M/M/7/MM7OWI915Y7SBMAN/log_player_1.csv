"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting at $12,000, which is significantly above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Emphasis on value:**  I'm framing the offer as a ""great deal"" for Bob to encourage him to consider it. 
* **Open-ended question:** Asking ""What do you think?"" invites Bob to respond and potentially start the negotiation process. 

**Important Notes:**

* **Time is money:**  I'm aware that I have a limited number of rounds, so I'm starting with a reasonably high price to see if I can quickly secure a good deal. 
* **John is a safety net:**  Knowing that I can sell to John for $15,000 gives me a fallback option if negotiations with Bob don't go well."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is too high for me. I'm willing to pay $6,000 for the product. I believe that's a fair price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $6,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  Accepting this offer would result in a substantial loss.
* **Negotiation is necessary:** While Bob's counteroffer is a starting point, it's clear that we need more negotiation to reach a mutually agreeable price.
* **Time is still on my side:** I have 8 rounds remaining, which gives me ample opportunity to negotiate a better deal or ultimately sell to John. 

**Next Steps:**

I will proceed to the next round and counter Bob's offer with a price closer to my desired range. I will aim for a price that is high enough to be profitable for me but also low enough to encourage Bob to continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $6,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000,  which is a fair compromise. This would allow me to make a reasonable profit while still giving you a good price. Let's keep talking."", ""product_price"": 9000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving closer:**  I've lowered my price to $9,000, which is closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  
* **Emphasizing compromise:**  I'm framing the counteroffer as a ""compromise"" to encourage Bob to see it as a fair and reasonable offer.
* **Maintaining motivation:**  I'm using language like ""keep talking"" to signal that I'm still interested in reaching a deal with Bob. 

**Important Notes:**

* **Strategic price point:** $9,000 is a strategic price point. It's a significant decrease from my initial offer but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Time factor:** I'm being proactive and using the remaining rounds effectively to find a solution that works for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  I'm getting closer to a price I can afford. How about $7,000? That's a significant increase from my last offer and would allow me to get the product I need at a price that works for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still too low:** While Bob's offer is an improvement, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. Accepting this offer would result in a substantial loss for me.
* **Negotiation continues:** Although time is running out, I'm determined to secure a better deal. I believe that further negotiation can lead to a price closer to my desired range.
* **John remains a safety net:**  Knowing that I can sell to John for $15,000 gives me the confidence to continue negotiating with Bob without settling for an unfavorable price.

**Next Steps:**

I will proceed to the next round and counter Bob's offer with a price that is higher than $7,000 but still lower than my previous offer of $9,000. I will try to find a middle ground that is acceptable to both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to find a price that works for you. While I appreciate the increase, $7,000 is still quite low. How about we meet in the middle at $8,500? This would allow both of us to walk away feeling satisfied. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 8500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** I'm proposing $8,500, which is exactly halfway between my last offer ($9,000) and Bob's current offer ($7,000). This demonstrates a willingness to compromise and potentially get the deal done.
* **Framing for satisfaction:** I'm framing the offer as a solution where ""both of us can walk away feeling satisfied,"" highlighting the potential for a mutually beneficial outcome.
* **Direct question:** Asking ""What do you say?"" encourages a quick response from Bob and keeps the negotiation moving forward. 

**Important Notes:**

* **Time constraint:** With 5 rounds remaining, I'm trying to accelerate the negotiation towards a conclusion. 
* **John's offer is still a fallback:** If Bob rejects this offer, I'm prepared to sell to John in the next round to ensure I don't lose out on a profitable deal."
