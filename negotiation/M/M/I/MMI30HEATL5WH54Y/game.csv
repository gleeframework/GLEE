"Alice, your initial offer is a bit too high for me.  I'm very interested in the product but my budget is $8,000.  Would you be willing to consider a price closer to that?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to sell it to you for $8,000. However, I'm willing to consider a compromise. I'll offer it to you for $10,000. It's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",10000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $10,000 is still a bit too much for me.  I'm willing to go up to $9,000, but that's my absolute limit.  Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to be reasonable, but I'm not willing to sell it to you for $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10,500. It's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",10500.0,Alice,5,
