"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $15,000. What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for your offer. However, $15,000 is quite steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $6,000.  What do you think?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $6,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about we discuss a price of $10,000? It's a compromise that I'm comfortable with, and it's still a great deal for you.",10000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While $10,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit above my budget. Could you consider $7,500? That would be a fair compromise, I think.",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $7,500 is still a bit low for me, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $9,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair price considering the value the product brings. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,5,
