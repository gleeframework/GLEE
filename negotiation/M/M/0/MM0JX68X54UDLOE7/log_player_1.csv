Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $12,000. This is above Bob's perceived value, but it gives me room to negotiate if needed. I'm also confident that I can get at least $10,000 from John if the negotiation fails."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. While it's tempting to take $9,500, I'm confident I can get a better price from either Bob or John. I'm going to reject this offer and see if I can get Bob to budge."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm lowering my price to $11,000. This is still above Bob's offer, but closer to his perceived value. Hopefully, this will encourage him to accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is now at my minimum acceptable price. There's no point in risking a further rejection and potentially ending up with nothing. Accepting this offer ensures I get my desired value and avoids the risk of ending up with nothing."
