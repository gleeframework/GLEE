"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. However, $120 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now. Would you be open to $100? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",100.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $120 might be a bit steep for you. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $110. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",110.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $110 is still a little more than I'm comfortable paying. How about $105?  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.",105.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $105 is still a bit above your budget, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $108. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",108.0,Alice,5,
