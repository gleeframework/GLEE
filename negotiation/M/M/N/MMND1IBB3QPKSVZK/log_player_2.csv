Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than John's, it's still above Bob's maximum budget.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the value you're presenting, $14,000 is slightly outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $12,500 for the product. This price is still within your profit margin and reflects the value I see in it. Let's work together to make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 12500}
