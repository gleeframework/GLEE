"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I really appreciate your enthusiasm for the product! However, $180 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider $80?  I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us.",80.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $180 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about we try $120? I think that's a fair price considering the value this product can bring to you.",120.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $120 is closer, I'm still a bit outside my budget.  I'm sticking with my original offer of $80. It's a fair price considering the product's value to me, and I'm confident we can reach a deal.",80.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $80 is a tough pill to swallow for you, but I'm not willing to go that low. However, I'm willing to make one more compromise. How about we meet at $100? I think that's a fair price considering the product's value to you, and it's still a good deal for me.",100.0,Alice,5,
