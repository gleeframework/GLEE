Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a unique opportunity for you to acquire something truly valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a high price of $1,000,000, hoping to leave room for negotiation and maximize my profit.
* **Value Proposition:** I emphasize the product's unique value to entice Bob. 
* **Openness to Negotiation:** The message implies flexibility and willingness to negotiate, encouraging Bob to engage in a conversation.

**Important Notes:**

* I'm aware that selling to John for $800,000 is a safety net. This will guide my negotiation strategy, ensuring I don't go too low.
* My future responses will depend on Bob's reaction and the potential for a better deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $1000000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $600000. Would you be willing to consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum value.**  I'm not willing to sell for less than $800,000.
* **Rejecting allows for further negotiation.**  By rejecting, I can counteroffer and try to close the gap between our desired prices.
* **Selling to John is still an option.**  If further negotiations fail, I can always secure the $800,000 from John.

**Next Steps:**

I will counteroffer Bob with a price closer to $800,000, aiming to find a compromise that benefits both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints.  While $600,000 is below my minimum, I'm willing to be flexible. How about we meet in the middle at $850,000? This would still be a great value for you, and it would allow me to move forward with the sale. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a compromise:** I'm offering a price that's significantly higher than Bob's offer but lower than my initial offer.  This shows a willingness to negotiate and find common ground.
* **Highlighting value:** I remind Bob that the product is still a great value at $850,000.
* **Maintaining my minimum:** I'm staying above my minimum value of $800,000, ensuring I don't lose out on a substantial profit.

**Next Steps:**

* **Wait for Bob's response:** I will analyze Bob's counteroffer and decide whether to accept, reject, or make another counteroffer.
* **Prepare for possible scenarios:** I'm ready to adjust my strategy based on Bob's responses. If he continues to offer significantly less, I might consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $850000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750000. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** Bob's offer of $750,000 is just $50,000 above my minimum value of $800,000.  This is not a significant enough profit margin to justify further negotiation.
* **Time is Money:** Further negotiation with Bob is likely to be time-consuming and might not result in a better offer. 
* **Guaranteed Deal:** Selling to John for $800,000 guarantees a sale at my minimum value, ensuring a secure outcome and saving me time and effort.

**Conclusion:**

While I'd prefer to maximize my profit, the risk of further negotiation with Bob outweighs the potential benefit.  Selling to John ensures I receive a fair price and avoid the uncertainty of further negotiations."
