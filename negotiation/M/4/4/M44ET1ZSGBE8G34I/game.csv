"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to purchase this exceptional product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,000. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you considering my budget.  While I'm very interested,  $9,000 is still a bit above what I can comfortably pay right now.  Would you be willing to come down to $8,500?  This would make it a great deal for both of us.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $8,500. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit. I can offer it to you for $9,200. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for you. What do you think?",9200.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $9,200 is still a bit more than I can comfortably spend.  How about we split the difference at $8,800? This would be a fair price for both of us, and we can close the deal.",8800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to meet you at $8,800. I think the product's value to you is higher than that. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $8,800 and $9,200, which is $9,000. I know I already offered you this price initially, but I'm willing to revisit it. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,5,
