# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $8,500. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit. I can offer it to you for $9,200. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for you. What do you think?

$9,200 is still too high, but there's still room for negotiation."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to meet you at $8,800. I think the product's value to you is higher than that. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $8,800 and $9,200, which is $9,000. I know I already offered you this price initially, but I'm willing to revisit it. What do you think?

Alice has come back to her original offer of $9,000.  While you would prefer a lower price, you've already made a counteroffer and it's unlikely Alice will go lower. At this point, it's better to accept the offer and avoid the risk of further negotiation.  Buying from John for $10,000 would be a worse deal."
