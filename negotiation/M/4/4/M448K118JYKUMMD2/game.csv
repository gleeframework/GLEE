"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am looking to keep my expenses within a certain budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $13,500? I believe this would be a fair compromise for both of us.",13500.0,Bob,2,

"I understand your position, Bob.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $13,500 is too low for me. Could you do $14,000? It's a fantastic deal at that price.",14000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. I'm still working within a specific budget, and unfortunately, $14,000 is beyond my current capacity. Could we possibly meet somewhere in the middle at $13,800?",13800.0,Bob,4,
