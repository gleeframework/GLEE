Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1700000} 

I'm starting high, aiming for a price closer to my valuation. Bob might counter, but I'm confident we can reach a mutually agreeable number. If he doesn't budge, I'll consider John's offer, but I'll try to get as close to my ideal price as possible."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price.  I'll counter with a more reasonable price, but I won't go below $1,500,000.  I'm still hoping to get closer to my valuation, but I'll see how much Bob is willing to budge."

I'm lowering the price a bit to show good faith and encourage further negotiation. I'm still above my minimum price, but I'm willing to compromise a bit.  I hope this encourages Bob to come up with a more reasonable offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Bob is still too low.  I'll counter again, but this time I'll be more firm. I'm getting closer to John's offer and I'm not sure how much more room Bob has to move."

This is my final counteroffer. I'm coming down a bit more, but I'm not willing to go any lower. If Bob doesn't accept this offer, I'll be forced to sell to John."
