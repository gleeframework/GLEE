"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the product at a price of $18,000. This is a great deal considering its value to you is $10,000. I'm confident you'll find it worth it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $18,000 is way above his maximum price, and he has a better alternative with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $14,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the time we've already spent discussing the price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 
While $14,000 is closer to Bob's desired price, it's still above his limit. It's more efficient for him to buy from John, as that option guarantees the best price within his budget."
