Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll make an offer to Bob. Since I don't know the value of the product to Bob, I'll start with a relatively high price. Here's my offer:

{""product_price"": 900,000}

Let's see how Bob reacts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","Bob's offer is a bit lower than my initial price, but still a decent offer. I'll consider my options:

1. Accepting Bob's offer would mean I'd earn $850,000, which is lower than my initial price, but still a good deal.
2. Rejecting Bob's offer and sending a counteroffer would give me a chance to negotiate further and potentially get a higher price. However, there's a risk that Bob might reject my counteroffer and I'd have to start over.
3. Selling the product to John for $800,000 would ensure I get my minimum price, but I might be leaving money on the table.

After weighing my options, I'll choose:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll send a counteroffer to Bob, hoping to get a better price."

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","Bob's offer is getting closer to my initial price, but I'm still not sure if I want to settle for $860,000. I'll consider my options:

1. Accepting Bob's offer would mean I'd earn $860,000, which is still a good deal, but I might be leaving some money on the table.
2. Rejecting Bob's offer and sending a counteroffer would give me a chance to negotiate further, but there's a risk that Bob might reject my counteroffer and I'd have to start over.
3. Selling the product to John for $800,000 would ensure I get my minimum price, but I might be leaving a significant amount of money on the table.

After weighing my options, I'll choose:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll send another counteroffer to Bob, trying to get even closer to my initial price."

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","Bob's offer is getting very close to my initial price, and I'm starting to think that it's getting harder to negotiate further. I'll consider my options:

1. Accepting Bob's offer would mean I'd earn $865,000, which is very close to my initial price. I might be leaving a small amount of money on the table, but it's a good deal.
2. Rejecting Bob's offer and sending a counteroffer would be a risk, as Bob might reject my counteroffer and I'd have to start over. Additionally, I'm not sure if I can get much closer to my initial price.
3. Selling the product to John for $800,000 would ensure I get my minimum price, but I'd be leaving a significant amount of money on the table.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

I'll accept Bob's offer of $865,000. It's a good deal, and I'm willing to take the risk of leaving a small amount of money on the table rather than trying to negotiate further."
