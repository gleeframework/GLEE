"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe is of great value to you.  I'm offering it to you for $20,000.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 20000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $20000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $17000. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $17,000 is a good price, it's still below my minimum value of $15,000. I have 8 more rounds to potentially get a better deal from Bob. I'll counter his offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and I'm willing to be flexible.  How about we split the difference and go with $18,500? This is a fair price considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 18500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $18500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $16500 for the product. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While I'm close to my minimum,  I'm not willing to sell the product for less than $16,000.  I have 6 more rounds to get a better offer from Bob.  I'll counter his offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price.  I'm still hopeful I can get a better price, even though I'm nearing my minimum value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  How about we meet in the middle again at $17,250?  This is a fair price considering the product's value and allows us both to come to a good agreement."", ""product_price"": 17250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting closer to a deal, but $17250 is still a bit too high. I'm willing to pay $16000 for the product. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $16,000 is just above my minimum value of $15,000. With only 4 rounds left, it's unlikely I'll get a significantly better offer. It's better to accept this offer and secure a sale than risk further negotiation and potentially losing the deal with Bob."
