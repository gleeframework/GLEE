Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. This is a great price considering its value.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting with a price of $12,000, which is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value of $8,000 but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Message:** I'm keeping the message friendly and focused on the value proposition of the product.

**Strategy:**

This strategy aims to:

* **Maximize profit:**  The starting price is close to my minimum acceptable value, maximizing potential profit.
* **Encourage negotiation:** The message is open to negotiation and encourages Bob to counteroffer.
* **Maintain flexibility:** I can still sell to John for $15,000 if Bob rejects the offer.

This approach allows for a balanced negotiation where I can potentially secure a price closer to my ideal while keeping options open."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $12000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $9,000 is a significant improvement over Bob's initial assessment, it's still far below my minimum value of $15,000.  I'm going to reject the offer and counter-propose. 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing profit:** I'm not yet desperate enough to accept a price this low. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  By rejecting and counter-offering, I demonstrate my willingness to compromise while also preserving my negotiating power.

**Next Steps:**

I will counter-offer with a price closer to my target while still being reasonable enough to keep Bob engaged."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $9,000 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $10,500? This is a fair price that acknowledges both of our needs. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm offering $10,500, which is the midpoint between my previous offer of $12,000 and Bob's offer of $9,000. This shows flexibility while still staying above my minimum value.
* **Message:** I'm being friendly and emphasizing fairness, making it clear that I'm willing to compromise but not at a price that significantly undervalues my product.

**Strategy:**

* **Maintain leverage:**  The counter-offer stays above my minimum value and avoids giving away too much.
* **Encourage compromise:**  The message shows I'm willing to compromise and encourages Bob to do the same.
* **Staying open to negotiation:**  I'm keeping the door open for further discussion, allowing Bob to make another counteroffer if needed.

This approach aims to find a middle ground that's fair to both parties while still ensuring a reasonable profit for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $10500 is not within my budget. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so how about $10000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's counteroffer of $10,000 is getting closer to my desired range, and it's only $500 below my previous offer.  At this point, it's not worth risking further negotiation and potentially losing the deal altogether.

**Reasoning:**

* **Potential for loss:**  If I reject Bob's offer, I risk him walking away, and I'll have to start the negotiation process with a new buyer, potentially wasting time and effort.
* **Acceptable profit:** $10,000 is still a decent profit and significantly higher than Bob's initial offer. 
* **Minimizing risk:**  Accepting this offer minimizes the risk of losing the deal completely.

**Conclusion:**

While I would have preferred to sell for closer to $12,000, I'm willing to accept $10,000 to secure the sale. The potential for a longer negotiation is too risky at this point."
