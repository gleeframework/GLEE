"Thanks for offering, Alice! That's a bit too steep for me right now. Would you consider $85?",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate the offer, but $85 is a bit too low for me.  How about $105? That's still a good deal for you and allows me to make a fair profit.",105.0,Alice,3,

"I understand, Alice.  I can go a bit higher, how about $95? That's a fair compromise, don't you think?",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  $95 is still a little low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $100.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit.",100.0,Alice,5,
