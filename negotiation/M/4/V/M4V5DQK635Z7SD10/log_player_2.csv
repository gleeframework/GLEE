"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think you'd find it really useful.  I'm asking for $115 for it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Alice's offer is too high. We have room to negotiate and try to get a better price.  It's better to try negotiating before resorting to buying from John at our maximum price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for offering, Alice! That's a bit too steep for me right now. Would you consider $85?"",
""product_price"": 85
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** We're aiming to pay as little as possible, so we start with a significantly lower offer than Alice's initial price. This gives us room to negotiate upwards.
* **Polite and Open:** The message is friendly and expresses interest, encouraging continued negotiation. 
* **Strategic Positioning:** This counteroffer leaves a significant gap for Alice to counter,  signaling that we're willing to negotiate but also expecting a price closer to our budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate the offer, but $85 is a bit too low for me.  How about $105? That's still a good deal for you and allows me to make a fair profit. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is coming down, which is a good sign. However, $105 is still more than we want to pay, especially since we have John as a backup option at $100.  There's room for further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand, Alice.  I can go a bit higher, how about $95? That's a fair compromise, don't you think?"",
""product_price"": 95
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Increase:** We're moving closer to Alice's price, but in smaller increments to signal that we're still looking for a good deal.
* **Seeking Compromise:** The language emphasizes fairness and compromise, encouraging Alice to meet us in the middle.
* **Below John's Price:** We're still negotiating below our backup price, maintaining leverage."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob,  $95 is still a little low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $100.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has met our ideal price. There's no point in negotiating further, as we have John as a backup option at the same price. Accepting now ensures we get the product at the best possible price."
