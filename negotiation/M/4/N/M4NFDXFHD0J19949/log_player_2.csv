Round 3
Alice's offer:

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your target price is $7,500, but I'm still looking to get closer to my target of $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $8,500. It's a fair compromise, and I think you'll find it's a great deal. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** 

Alice is stubbornly sticking close to her original price. She has shown no willingness to go below $8,200.  At this point, continuing the negotiation is unlikely to result in a price significantly better than John's offer of $8,000. It's time to cut my losses and buy from John."
