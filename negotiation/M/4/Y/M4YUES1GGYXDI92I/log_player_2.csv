Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer, Bob. However, I'm still not convinced that $950,000 is sufficient. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,200,000 and $950,000, which would be $1,075,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to me is $1,500,000, but I'm willing to compromise to reach a deal with you.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $1,075,000.
