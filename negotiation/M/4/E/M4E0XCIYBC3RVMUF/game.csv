"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer!  $15,000 is a bit out of my price range.  I'd be interested in purchasing if you were willing to come down to $9,000.  Let me know what you think!",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer! I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not quite ready to go as low as $9,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $12,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. Let me know if this is something you'd like to move forward with!",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $12,000 is still a bit higher than what I can afford.  Would you be willing to go down to $10,000?  I'm serious about buying this product, but I'm really trying to stay within my budget.",10000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, and I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, I'm not quite ready to go as low as $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $10,000 and $12,000, so I'm offering it to you for $11,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair price considering the value the product brings. Let me know if this is something you'd like to move forward with!",11000.0,Alice,5,
