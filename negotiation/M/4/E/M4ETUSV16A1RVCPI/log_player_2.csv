"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a reasonable offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $12,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

Alice's offer is too high.  Bob should reject and try to negotiate a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $11,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000

While $11,000 is closer to Bob's target, it's still higher than his ideal price. He should try to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $11,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $9,500.  If that's not acceptable, I'll have to go with another seller."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're sticking to your offer, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer you the product for $10,500. This is as low as I'm willing to go. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

At this point, Bob should accept Alice's offer.  He's already gotten the price down significantly, and continuing to negotiate might risk losing the deal entirely.  The price is within his budget, and  buying from John would be a worse outcome for Bob."
