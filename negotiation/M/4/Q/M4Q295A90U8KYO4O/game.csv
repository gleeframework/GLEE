"Hello Bob, it's great to connect with you. I'm excited to offer you the chance to acquire this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000.  I believe this represents a fair starting point for negotiations. What are your thoughts?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the opportunity to acquire this product,  $1,100,000 is unfortunately outside of my budget. Given my research and the value I see in this product, I'm willing to offer $850,000. I believe this price reflects the true value of the product while also allowing us to reach an agreement.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However,  $850,000 undervalues the true potential of this product. I've had significant interest from other parties. To find a middle ground, I'm proposing $1,000,000. This price reflects my willingness to compromise while ensuring the product's value is recognized. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,000,000 is still a significant stretch for me.  I'm willing to go up to $900,000, which is a considerable increase from my previous offer.  This is a serious offer, and I hope you will reconsider your position.  Let's find a way to close this deal.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your efforts to reach a deal. To be candid, my fallback position is to accept an offer from another buyer for the full asking price. However, I value our discussions and believe we can find an agreement. I'm willing to come down to $975,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's worth. Let me know your decision.",975000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate your flexibility, but $975,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm ready to close this deal right now for $925,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. If we can't reach an agreement at this price, I'll need to pursue other options.",925000.0,Bob,6,
