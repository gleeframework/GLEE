Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the opportunity to acquire this product,  $1,100,000 is unfortunately outside of my budget. Given my research and the value I see in this product, I'm willing to offer $850,000. I believe this price reflects the true value of the product while also allowing us to reach an agreement.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Round 4
Bob's offer:

This is a serious offer, and I hope you will reconsider your position.  Let's find a way to close this deal.

This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. If we can't reach an agreement at this price, I'll need to pursue other options.

**Reasoning:**

While selling to John guarantees $1,200,000, accepting Bob's offer of $925,000 makes the most sense at this point. Here's why:

* **Significant Profit:** $925,000 is still a substantial profit over Bob's perceived value of $800,000. 
* **Time Value of Money:** Closing the deal now avoids potential delays and uncertainties associated with further negotiation or waiting for another buyer.
* **Negotiation Dynamics:** Bob has presented his ""final offer"" and might walk away if you reject it. Accepting shows goodwill and avoids the risk of losing the sale altogether.

While holding out for more might be tempting, the certainty of a significant profit now outweighs the potential for a slightly higher offer in later rounds, especially with the risk of Bob walking away."
