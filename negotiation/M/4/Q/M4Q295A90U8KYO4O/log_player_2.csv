Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the opportunity to acquire this product,  $1,100,000 is unfortunately outside of my budget. Given my research and the value I see in this product, I'm willing to offer $850,000. I believe this price reflects the true value of the product while also allowing us to reach an agreement.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap."", ""product_price"": 850000}

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However,  $850,000 undervalues the true potential of this product. I've had significant interest from other parties. To find a middle ground, I'm proposing $1,000,000. This price reflects my willingness to compromise while ensuring the product's value is recognized. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high. While she has lowered the price, it's still above my budget. I'll continue to negotiate to try and bring the price down closer to my limit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $1,000,000 is still a significant stretch for me.  I'm willing to go up to $900,000, which is a considerable increase from my previous offer.  This is a serious offer, and I hope you will reconsider your position.  Let's find a way to close this deal."", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your efforts to reach a deal. To be candid, my fallback position is to accept an offer from another buyer for the full asking price. However, I value our discussions and believe we can find an agreement. I'm willing to come down to $975,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's worth. Let me know your decision. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000.

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still outside my budget. I'm not willing to go above $900,000. I'll continue negotiating with Alice and try to reach a deal closer to my limit."
