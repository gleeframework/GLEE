Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its potential value, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the significant benefit it offers to you."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  You want to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($1,500,000) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $1,400,000 leaves some room for Bob to potentially negotiate a slightly higher price, getting you closer to his maximum.
* **Strong but Fair:** The message emphasizes the product's value to justify the high price while also positioning it as a ""fair deal."" This approach aims to make Bob feel like he's getting a reasonable, if premium, offer.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Negotiating Style:** This strategy assumes you don't know Bob's negotiation tactics. If you know he's prone to hard bargaining, you might start even higher.
* **Time Sensitivity:** If you're under time pressure to sell, you might lower the price slightly to increase the chance of a quick sale."
