Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it's worth a great deal and would be happy to sell it for $10,000."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always best to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a higher profit. 
* **Gauging Interest:** Bob's response to this initial offer will be telling. If he accepts, great! If he rejects, we know we need to potentially come down in price, but we haven't lost anything because we have John as a backup buyer.

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters. Remember, your absolute minimum is $8,000."
