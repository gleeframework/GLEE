Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $90. I think you'll find it's a great deal for a product you value highly."", ""product_price"": 90}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $100.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $80. 
* **Maximizing Profit:** By offering the product at $90, you're aiming for a price that's attractive to Bob (as it's below his perceived value) while still securing a significant profit for yourself. 
* **Alternative Buyer:** Knowing you have John as a backup buyer at $80 gives you leverage in negotiations with Bob. 

This strategy balances risk and reward. There's a chance Bob might try to negotiate for a lower price, but starting at $90 gives you room to potentially lower the price slightly and still come out ahead of your agreement with John."
