"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a valuable piece, and I believe this price reflects its worth. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but my budget is closer to $8,000. Would you consider that?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $8,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down a bit.  How about $10,500? This would be a fair price considering the value of the product.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $10,500 is still more than I'm comfortable spending.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,250?",9250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position. Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us.  I'm willing to come down to $9,750. It's a fair price, and it allows me to make a profit while giving you a good deal on the product.",9750.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, this is getting closer. I can appreciate you working with me on this. How about we split the difference again and settle at $9,500?",9500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm seeing your willingness to negotiate, and I appreciate that. $9,500 is close to my minimum, but I'm willing to meet in the middle one more time. How about $9,625? I believe this is a fair compromise, and it allows us to close the deal.",9625.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're tough! I'm willing to go up slightly to $9,550. This is my final offer. If this doesn't work, I'll have to go with John.",9550.0,Bob,8,
