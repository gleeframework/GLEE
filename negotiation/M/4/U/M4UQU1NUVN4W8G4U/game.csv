"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you're willing to negotiate.  However, $1,200,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $1,050,000 at this point.  Let me know what you think.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit far apart from your offer. I'm willing to meet you in the middle and offer the product to you for $1,175,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the effort I've put into it. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",1175000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  I'm still a bit high at $1,175,000. I'm willing to go up to $1,125,000. This is a significant step for me, and I'm hoping we can find common ground.",1125000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,175,000 and $1,125,000, which would be $1,150,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the effort I've put into it. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",1150000.0,Alice,5,
