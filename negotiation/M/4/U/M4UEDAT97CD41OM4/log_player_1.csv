Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really enjoy it. I'm offering it to you for $135. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 135}
``` 

This offer is a bit above Bob's perceived value, but it still allows for potential negotiation and gives me some room to lower the price if necessary. It also shows that I'm willing to negotiate and reach a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $135 is a bit too high for my budget. Could you do $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150. While I'd prefer to sell to him, it's not worth it at such a low price. I'll counteroffer to try and get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and I understand your budget constraints. However, $100 is a bit too low for me. Would you be willing to pay $120? That's still a great deal for a product that's worth so much."", ""product_price"": 120}
```"
