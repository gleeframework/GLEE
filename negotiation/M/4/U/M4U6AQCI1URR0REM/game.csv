"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of a price more around $8500. Would you be willing to consider that?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. However, $8500 is quite a bit lower than what I need to make this work.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $9250?  This would still be a great deal for you, and it would allow me to proceed with the sale. Let me know your thoughts!",9250.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thank you for the counteroffer. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $8800? I'm really interested in the product, and I'm willing to make a compromise, but I need to stay within my budget.",8800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I'm still interested in working with you.  However, $8800 is still a bit too low for me.  Would you be willing to go up to $9000? This would be a good compromise, and I would be happy to finalize the sale. Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I understand that you're still trying to make a profit, but I'm really close to my budget limit. I'm willing to go up to $8900, but I think that's the maximum I can stretch to. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",8900.0,Bob,6,
