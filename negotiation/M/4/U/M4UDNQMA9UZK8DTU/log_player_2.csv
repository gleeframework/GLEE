"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value to you is $1,500,000. I'm willing to make a concession, but I'm not willing to go too low. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $950,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $825,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're looking for a better deal, and I'm willing to listen. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. I can offer it to you for $800,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. This is already a discount from the original price, and I think it's a fair compromise. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000.

Alice has reached her minimum price and it's unlikely she'll go lower. Accepting the $800,000 offer is a good deal and avoids the risk of having to buy from John at the much higher price."
