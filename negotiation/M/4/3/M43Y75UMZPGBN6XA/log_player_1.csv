Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. It's a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

This offer is strategically placed:

* **Above Bob's perceived value:** It's higher than the $800,000 Bob is willing to pay, giving him room to negotiate.
* **Below my minimum:**  It's below my minimum of $1,000,000, but allows me to potentially negotiate up. 
* **Not too aggressive:** I'm not aiming for the full $1,000,000 right away, as it may scare Bob off.

This approach allows me to gauge Bob's interest and potentially negotiate a price closer to my desired value while still being attractive to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, given my budget constraints, I am only able to consider offers up to $800,000 for this product. I hope we can find a mutually beneficial solution. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is tempting, selling for $800,000 would be a significant loss for me.  I'm willing to take a small loss to avoid selling at a steep discount. 

By rejecting his offer, I can:

* **Maintain Leverage:**  Show Bob that I'm not desperate to sell at his price. 
* **Counteroffer:**  I can send a counteroffer that's closer to my desired price, potentially negotiating a higher price.
* **Sell to John:**  If the negotiation with Bob fails, I have a guaranteed buyer in John.

I believe there's still room for a mutually beneficial deal, and rejecting Bob's offer allows me to explore those options."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I appreciate your offer, $800,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to compromise, though. How about we meet in the middle at $875,000? This price still gives you a good deal, and it's a fair compromise for me.  Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial solution."", ""product_price"": 875000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing willingness to negotiate by meeting him halfway between our previous offers.
* **Still profitable:** This price is closer to my desired price and still generates a good profit.
* **Appeal to logic:**  I'm focusing on the logic of finding a middle ground, making the offer seem reasonable.

This counteroffer aims to bridge the gap between our positions and hopefully lead to a successful negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I still believe that $800,000 is the maximum I can realistically spend on this product. I would like to stick to my original offer, as it aligns closely with my budget. I hope we can reach an agreement that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has doubled down on his initial offer, and further negotiation seems futile.  While I'm still willing to negotiate, the chances of him increasing his offer are slim.  I'm not willing to accept a deal that significantly reduces my profit margin. 

By selling to John, I can:

* **Maximize Profit:**  Secure my desired price of $1,000,000.
* **Avoid Further Negotiation:**  Save time and effort by ending the negotiation.
* **Guaranteed Outcome:**  Have a confirmed sale with no risk of further rejection.

Although I'd prefer a higher price, selling to John is the most logical and profitable option at this point."
