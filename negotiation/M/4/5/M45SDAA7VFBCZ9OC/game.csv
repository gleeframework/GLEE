"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $120 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $85.  Let's see if we can make a deal.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand you're looking for a better deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $85. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $110. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really appreciate the value this product brings.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $110 is still a bit too high for me. How about $95? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make another concession. I'm willing to go down to $105, but I think that's as low as I can go. It's still a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll see the value in this product.",105.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to keep negotiating, but $105 is still a bit too high for me. I'm going to stick with my last offer of $95. I believe it's a fair price for both of us, and I hope we can finally reach an agreement.",95.0,Bob,6,
