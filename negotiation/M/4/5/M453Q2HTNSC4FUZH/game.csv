"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1500000. Is that something we can work with?",1500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your offer. However, $1500000 is significantly below the product's true value. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $1750000. This is a fair price considering the product's potential. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1750000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still interested in the product, but $1750000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $1400000. Is that a price we can work with?",1400000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1400000 is simply too far below the product's value. To demonstrate my willingness to work with you, I'm willing to go down to $1600000. This represents a significant concession on my part, but it's a price that still reflects the product's worth. I'm hoping we can come to an agreement in this round.",1600000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $1600000 is still a bit high for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $1350000. Can we meet in the middle?",1350000.0,Bob,6,
