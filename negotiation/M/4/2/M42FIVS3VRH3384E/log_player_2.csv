"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this valuable product.  My asking price is $1400000. I believe this price reflects the product's true value and potential benefits to you.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  Here's why:

* **Alice's offer is too high.** Bob's maximum budget is $1,500,000, and Alice is asking for $1,400,000. This leaves very little room for negotiation.
* **There's potential for a better deal.**  Bob can try to negotiate with Alice and potentially get a lower price.  While the risk exists that negotiations could fail, it's worth exploring. 

**Next steps:**

Bob should make a counteroffer to Alice, aiming for a price closer to his target range.  He should also be prepared to walk away if Alice is unwilling to budge significantly."

{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the value in this product, $1,400,000 is a bit outside my budget.  I'm prepared to offer $1,250,000 for it.  This reflects a fair price for both of us, allowing me to make the purchase and you to still make a profit.  Let's see if we can find common ground here."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Reasoning:** This counteroffer is a significant step down from Alice's asking price, demonstrating Bob's willingness to negotiate.  However, it's still above Alice's desired price, leaving room for potential compromise.
* **Message:** The message is friendly and professional, acknowledging Alice's offer and highlighting the value Bob sees in the product.  It also presents a clear justification for the counteroffer.
* **Price:**  $1,250,000 is a reasonable starting point for negotiation. It's a good middle ground between Alice's asking price and Bob's maximum budget, and it leaves room for further negotiation if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I understand your budget, $1250000 doesn't quite meet my minimum requirement.  I'm willing to come down to $1350000.  This compromise ensures a fair deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.  Let's aim for a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's Offer is still too high:** While Alice has lowered her price, it's still $150,000 higher than Bob's ideal price.  This leaves room for further negotiation.
* **Bob has room to push for a lower price:**  Bob's counteroffer at $1,250,000 showed that he's serious about getting a good deal.  It's likely Alice is willing to come down further.
* **John is a backup option:**  Knowing he can purchase from John for $1,500,000 gives Bob leverage in negotiations with Alice.

**Next Steps:**

Bob should continue to negotiate with Alice by sending another counteroffer, aiming for a price closer to his target. He should be prepared to walk away if Alice is unwilling to budge significantly."
