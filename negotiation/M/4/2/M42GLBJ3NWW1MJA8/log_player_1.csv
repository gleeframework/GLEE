"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $2,000,000. This is a fair price given its value and potential.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 2000000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your initial offer was way too high.  I'm interested in this product, but I can't afford that price. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it. This is a fair price given my budget and the value of the product. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $850,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  I'm willing to risk a few more rounds to see if I can get closer to my goal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $850,000 is a decent starting point, it's still far below my minimum acceptable price.  To be fair to both of us, I'm willing to drop my price to $1,700,000. This leaves room for profit for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1700000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,700,000 is still way out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000.  This is a fair offer considering the value of the product and my financial constraints.  Let's see if we can close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is showing a willingness to negotiate, his offer of $1,000,000 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I'm willing to risk a few more rounds to see if I can get closer to my goal. I also want to see if he will continue to raise his offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,000,000 is simply not feasible for me.  To make this deal work, I need to be closer to my minimum.  I'm willing to drop my price to $1,400,000.  This is a significant compromise on my end. Let's see if we can find a middle ground here."", ""product_price"": 1400000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,400,000 is still above my budget.  I'm willing to offer you $1,200,000 for the product. This is a significant step closer to your minimum, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product and our ongoing discussions. Let's find a way to make this work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000, his offer of $1,200,000 is still below that threshold. I'm willing to risk a few more rounds to see if I can get closer to my target price. It's also possible that Bob might be willing to go even higher with his offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product. $1,200,000 is getting closer, but still not quite there. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to drop my price to $1,300,000. This offer is a fair compromise, considering the value of the product and our ongoing negotiations. Let's work towards a final agreement."", ""product_price"": 1300000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I see we're making progress.  $1,300,000 is closer to where I need to be, but I'm still not there yet.  My final offer is $1,100,000.  If you're willing to accept this, we can close the deal.  Otherwise, I'll have to go with John's offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is higher than his previous offers, it's still well below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. With only two rounds left, the chances of reaching my target price are slim. It's more beneficial for me to sell the product to John for $1,500,000, guaranteeing me a good return."
