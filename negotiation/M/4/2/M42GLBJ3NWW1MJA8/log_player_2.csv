Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $850,000 is a decent starting point, it's still far below my minimum acceptable price.  To be fair to both of us, I'm willing to drop my price to $1,700,000. This leaves room for profit for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,000,000 is simply not feasible for me.  To make this deal work, I need to be closer to my minimum.  I'm willing to drop my price to $1,400,000.  This is a significant compromise on my end. Let's see if we can find a middle ground here. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product. $1,200,000 is getting closer, but still not quite there. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to drop my price to $1,300,000.
