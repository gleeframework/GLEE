{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really love! I'm asking for $90 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 90}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value to see if I can get a good deal. I'm also being friendly and positive in my message to create a good rapport."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hey Alice, thanks for the offer.  $90 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  How about $75?  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $75 is more than my minimum, it's not ideal. I'll try to get closer to my desired price by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I appreciate your offer but $75 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $82.50? That seems fair, wouldn't you say? "", ""product_price"": 82.5}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $82.50 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying.  I'm willing to go up to $80, which is the price John is selling it for.  Let's make a deal at that price and avoid any further negotiations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $80 is my minimum, and it seems like he's not willing to budge further.  It's better to secure the sale now rather than risk him backing out or continuing to haggle."
