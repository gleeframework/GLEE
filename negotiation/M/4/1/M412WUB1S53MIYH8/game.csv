"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand that $90 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $95. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",95.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $95 is still a little outside my budget.  I'm sticking with my offer of $90.  It's a fair price for both of us and would allow us to close this deal quickly. ",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $90 is still a bit low for me, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $92. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's a fair price considering the value the product brings. Let me know what you think.",92.0,Alice,5,
