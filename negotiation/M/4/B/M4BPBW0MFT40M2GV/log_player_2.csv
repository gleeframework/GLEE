"Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

You can still get the product for a lower price than $900,000. There's potential to negotiate further and save money.  Buying from John right now would cost you more than negotiating with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Explanation:**

This counteroffer is a starting point for negotiation. It's significantly lower than Alice's offer but still above her minimum acceptable price ($800,000). This shows Alice that you're serious about buying the product, but you're also willing to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is higher than your initial counteroffer, but still within a range where you can negotiate further.  You haven't reached your maximum price point yet, so continuing the negotiation process is the most logical choice.  Buying from John would be more expensive at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 875000}
```

**Explanation:**

This counteroffer is a slight increase from your previous offer, showing that you're willing to compromise but still seeking a better price. It's a reasonable middle ground that might convince Alice to accept, especially as you're getting closer to her minimum acceptable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is back to her initial offer of $900,000. While you'd prefer a lower price, you've already tried negotiating and Alice is firm. Buying from John would cost you significantly more, making this offer the most cost-effective option."
