"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","Since Bob's offer is higher than my minimum price of $800,000, I'll consider it. However, since the product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob, I think I can do better.

I'll reject Bob's offer and send a counteroffer to him. I'll offer the product for $950,000.
