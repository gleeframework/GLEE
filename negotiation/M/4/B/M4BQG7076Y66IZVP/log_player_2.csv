"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is still above Bob's maximum budget, and he's already gone through a few rounds of negotiation. At this point, it's likely that Alice is unwilling to go lower, and further negotiation may be unproductive. Buying from John ensures Bob gets the product within his budget without the risk of further negotiation that may lead to a higher price or a stalemate."
