Round 2
Bob's offer:

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

**Reasoning:**

Bob is very slowly increasing his offer, and is unlikely to reach our $80 minimum in the remaining rounds.  It's more profitable to take the guaranteed $80 from John than risk getting stuck with a lower offer from Bob."
