Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Reservation Value (RV):** $1,500,000 (You'll sell to John at this price).
* **Bob's Perceived Value:** $1,200,000
* **Zone of Possible Agreement (ZOPA):**  Exists because Bob values the product at a lower price than your RV. Any price between $1,200,001 and $1,499,999 could potentially work.

**Strategy**

You want to aim for a price closer to Bob's perceived value while ensuring you don't go below your RV. Since you have a guaranteed buyer, you hold a strong position.

**Offer:**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product. I know it would be a valuable asset to you. I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000. This offer reflects my understanding of the product's worth and my desire for a mutually beneficial deal."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Direct and Positive Tone:** The message is clear and starts by acknowledging Bob's potential interest.
* **Strong Opening Price:**  $1,350,000 leaves room for negotiation while staying significantly above Bob's perceived value. 
* **Justification:**  You vaguely mention ""understanding of the product's worth"" without revealing your bottom line.
* **Emphasis on Mutual Benefit:**  Framing it as a ""win-win"" can make Bob more receptive.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Negotiation Style:** If you anticipate Bob to be a tough negotiator, you might want to start with a slightly higher price. 
* **Time Sensitivity:** If you need to sell quickly, you might be willing to accept a slightly lower price.

**Outcome:**

* **If Bob Accepts:** You've made a significant profit above his perceived value.
* **If Bob Rejects:** You can always counter-offer, or proceed with your guaranteed sale to John."
