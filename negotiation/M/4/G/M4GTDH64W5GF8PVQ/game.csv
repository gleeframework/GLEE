"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this exceptional product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. I'm willing to start the conversation with an offer of $1,400,000. What are your thoughts?",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  This product is quite interesting to me, but $1,400,000 is a bit steep for me right now. Would you consider $1,200,000?",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $1,200,000 is a bit lower than your target, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can do $1,300,000, which is a significant discount from my initial offer. What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  How about we settle at $1,250,000? That's a fair compromise.",1250000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence! I can see you're serious about this product. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving too much on the table. How about we meet at $1,280,000? It's still a great deal for you, and I think it's a fair price considering the value this product brings",1280000.0,Alice,5,
