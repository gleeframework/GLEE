Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be highly beneficial to you.  I'm asking for $11,500. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to Bob's $12,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $11,500 leaves some room for potential negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. 
* **Above Minimum:** The price is well above Alice's minimum of $10,000, ensuring a good profit even if Bob negotiates down.

This strategy aims to secure a deal with Bob at a high price while still leaving Alice the option to sell to John for her minimum acceptable amount."
