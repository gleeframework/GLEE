Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1100000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $1050000, which is still a fair price considering the product's value to me. What do you think?

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $1,050,000 is closer to my desired price, I believe I can get closer to $1,200,000 by continuing to negotiate with Bob. I'll try to push him a little higher in the next round."

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's getting closer, $1,025,000 is still too far below my desired price. I'm determined to reach a better agreement with Bob, or if necessary, I'll sell to John and secure the full $1,200,000."

I'm choosing to sell to John for $1,200,000. While I'm disappointed that I couldn't close a deal with Bob, the negotiations have reached a point where the potential profit is no longer worth the risk of further back and forth. I've decided to take the guaranteed profit from John and move on."
