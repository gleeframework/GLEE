"Hello Alice, thanks for your offer.  While I recognize the value of your product, that price point is a little high for me. I'd be willing to purchase the product for $850,000.  Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective on the price.  While I'm confident this product will yield significant returns for you, I can't go as low as $850,000.  How about we meet in the middle, say at $1,150,000?",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,150,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for a price closer to $900,000. Would you consider $925,000?",925000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your continued engagement.  I see you're serious about this purchase, and I want to find a solution that works for both of us.  While $925,000 is still below my ideal price, I'm willing to accept $1,050,000. This is a significant compromise on my end, reflecting my desire to see this deal through. What do you say?",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  Your offer of $1,050,000 is tempting, but I'm still aiming for something a bit lower.  Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $975,000? This would be a great point for us to close the deal.",975000.0,Bob,6,
