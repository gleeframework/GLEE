Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product, $1,450,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for it. Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,400,000 is still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $1,350,000? I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000.

While I could push for more, accepting Bob's offer of $1,350,000 is a strong return and avoids the risk of him walking away. It's a significant profit above my minimum, making it a good deal overall."
