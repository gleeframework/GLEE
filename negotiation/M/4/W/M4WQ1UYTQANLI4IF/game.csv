"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity. However,  $11000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to pay $10500.  Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer of $10500. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still looking to get a better price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11250. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",11250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $11250 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $10750.  This is a fair compromise, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement.",10750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $10750 is a good compromise, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for that price. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. I'll sell it to you for $11000, which is the lowest price I'm willing to accept. Let me know if this is acceptable to you.",11000.0,Alice,5,
