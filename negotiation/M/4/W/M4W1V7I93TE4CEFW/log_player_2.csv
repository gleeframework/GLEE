```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,187,500 is very close to Bob's last counteroffer of $1,175,000. This indicates that they are very close to reaching a deal. Accepting this offer is a good compromise for both parties.  While Bob could continue negotiating, the risk of reaching a stalemate or the product being unavailable from Alice increases.  Additionally, Bob has the option of purchasing the product from John for $1,500,000 if he doesn't reach a deal with Alice. Accepting this offer is the most beneficial option for Bob, as it allows him to save a significant amount of money compared to buying from John."
