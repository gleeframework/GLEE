"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $150. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!",150.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $125.  This gives you a good deal, and I still get a fair price for the product.  Let me know what you think.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above $125. How about we meet in the middle at $115? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",115.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. $115 is closer, but I'm still a bit off. How about we meet at $118? It's a small compromise from both of us, and it gets us closer to a deal. What do you say?",118.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above $118. I'm willing to meet you halfway from $115, so how about we try $116? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",116.0,Bob,6,
