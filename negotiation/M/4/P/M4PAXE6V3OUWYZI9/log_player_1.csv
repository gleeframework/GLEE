I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,250,000 is a decent amount, I believe I can get closer to my desired price range. I have 9 more rounds and I'm not in a rush to settle for anything less than I believe the product is worth."

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While getting closer to my desired price, $1,300,000 still doesn't reflect the true value of the product in my eyes. I'm willing to continue negotiating to see if we can reach a mutually beneficial price."
