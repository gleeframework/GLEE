"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  $500,000 is a great price, but it's worth seeing if Alice will go lower. There are still 9 rounds to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 300000}
```

**Reasoning:** I'm starting with a low counteroffer to see if Alice is willing to negotiate significantly. This is a substantial reduction from her initial offer and allows room for bargaining in subsequent rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** While $400,000 is a good price, I'm still hoping to get it lower. I have several rounds left to negotiate, and Alice is clearly willing to compromise.  Rejecting and countering will allow me to try to reach a price closer to my initial counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 350000}
```

**Reasoning:**  I'm increasing my counteroffer slightly from the previous round.  $350,000 is a middle ground between my initial offer and Alice's latest offer. This shows I'm serious about buying but still want a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $450,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice has moved closer to my counteroffer, and I'm running out of rounds. $450,000 is a good price, considering my maximum budget is $1,500,000. It's worth accepting this offer rather than risking a higher price or running out of time."
