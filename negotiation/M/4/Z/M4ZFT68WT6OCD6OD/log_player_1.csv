Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

```

I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,000,000. This is a good starting point because it's higher than what the product is worth to Bob, but lower than what it's worth to me. This gives us both room to negotiate. 

If Bob rejects, I'll evaluate his counteroffer and consider if it's worth continuing the negotiation or selling to John instead."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $900,000 is closer to my minimum than my initial offer, it's still significantly below my desired price point. I'll try to push for a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

I'm offering the product to Bob for $950,000. This is a compromise, meeting him halfway between our last offers.  I'm hoping this demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while still ensuring I get a price closer to my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting too low. I'm not willing to drop below my minimum price point. Selling to John for $1,200,000 is the best option at this point. It ensures I get my desired price and avoids further negotiation with Bob."
