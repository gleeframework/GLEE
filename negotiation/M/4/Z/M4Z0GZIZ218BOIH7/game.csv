"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. I'm looking to spend closer to $7,000. Would you be willing to come down on the price?",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $7,000 is simply too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $8,500?  This gives us both a good deal and allows us to move forward.  Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  While $8,500 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still hoping to get a little bit of a better price. Would you consider $7,500? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",7500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, and I'm willing to be flexible. However, $7,500 is still a bit too low for me. Let's try to find a middle ground.  I'm willing to come down to $8,000. This would be a good deal for both of us.  What do you say?",8000.0,Alice,5,
