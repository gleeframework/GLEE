Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,500. I believe that's a fair price considering the value you mentioned.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $12,500 is better than John's offer, I believe I can still get closer to my desired price of $14,000. I'll counter with a lower price than my initial offer but still higher than Bob's."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my original asking price. How about $13,500? It's a good compromise, and it still leaves some room for you to benefit from this product."", ""product_price"": 13500}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $13,000. How about we meet in the middle at $13,250? I'm willing to compromise, but I don't want to go too far above my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,250

Bob's offer of $13,250 is a good compromise and gets me closer to my desired price. Accepting this offer is a good decision, as it is significantly higher than John's offer of $12,000."
