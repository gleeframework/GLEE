{""product_price"": 1200000}

Since I'm Alice, I value the product at $1,200,000.  My best option is to sell it to John for that amount, as that's my minimum acceptable price.  I'll offer Bob the same price, knowing he will likely reject it.  This ensures I get my desired price while also being fair to Bob, as he can opt out and find a different solution."
