"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $950,000 is fair. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer is too high. While the product is worth a good amount, starting at $950,000 leaves little room for negotiation and savings. It's in Bob's best interest to counter-offer and try to bring the price down."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, $950,000 is a bit steep for me. How about we meet in the middle at $850,000?"",
""product_price"": 850000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you countering. I'm willing to negotiate, but $850,000 is below its true value. How about we agree on $900,000? This reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your interest. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is coming down, but there's still room to negotiate. A $50,000 reduction isn't enough to warrant accepting just yet. Bob should counter again, aiming to close the gap further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm definitely interested in the product, but $900,000 is still a little high for my budget. Would you consider $870,000? That feels like a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 870000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I respect that. How about we split the difference and settle on $885,000? I believe that's a fair deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $885,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $885,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice is moving closer to Bob's range, and $885,000 is a reasonable price. While Bob could try to negotiate further, the potential savings might not outweigh the risk of Alice increasing her price or Bob running out of rounds. Accepting at this point ensures Bob gets the product at a significant discount from both Alice's initial offer and John's price."
