Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. It's a fantastic deal considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting at $950,000, leaving some room for negotiation. This price is still significantly higher than Bob's perceived value of $800,000, but it's less than my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.
* **Positive framing:** I'm emphasizing the ""fantastic deal"" aspect to encourage Bob to consider my offer.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** By starting high, I can potentially negotiate down to a price that is still profitable for me while still leaving Bob feeling like he got a good deal.

**Next steps:**

* If Bob accepts, I've successfully secured a good price.
* If Bob rejects, I'll assess his counteroffer and determine whether to accept or make a counteroffer of my own.
* If the negotiation stalls or doesn't seem promising, I can always switch to John and sell the product for $1,000,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $950,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $850,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. 
* **Negotiation room:** I still have room to negotiate with Bob. While his offer is lower than my initial price, there's potential to reach a compromise closer to my target.
* **Potential for a better deal:**  I believe I can secure a better price by continuing the negotiation.

**Next Steps:**

* I will counter Bob's offer with a price closer to my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. 
* I'll use a counteroffer to gauge Bob's commitment and potentially find a middle ground. 
* If the negotiation becomes too time-consuming or unproductive, I will switch to John and sell the product for $1,000,000."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $900,000, which is still a great deal for you considering the product's value.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-offering closer to my minimum:**  I'm offering $900,000, which is closer to my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000 but still leaves some room for negotiation.
* **Highlighting the value:** I emphasize that $900,000 is still ""a great deal"" for Bob, reminding him of the product's value. 
* **Positive and collaborative tone:** I'm using a positive and collaborative tone to encourage Bob to consider my counteroffer.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, I've successfully secured a good price.
* If Bob rejects, I'll reassess his next offer and determine whether to accept it or make another counteroffer.
* If the negotiation becomes unproductive, I'll switch to John and sell the product for $1,000,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but $900,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $875,000 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:**  While it's closer to my minimum acceptable price, $875,000 is still below the $1,000,000 I can get from John.
* **Potential for further negotiation:** There's still some room for negotiation with Bob. I believe I can push for a higher price.
* **Risk of losing John:** If I keep negotiating with Bob and he rejects my next offer, I risk losing the opportunity to sell the product to John for $1,000,000. 

**Next Steps:**

* I will counter Bob's offer with a price slightly closer to my minimum. I'll aim for $925,000 or $950,000.
* I'll emphasize the product's value to Bob and the limited opportunity he has to purchase it. 
* If Bob rejects my next offer, I will likely sell the product to John to secure the guaranteed $1,000,000."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $875,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $925,000, which reflects the value of this product and your commitment to acquiring it.  This is my final offer.  If you decide to accept, we can close the deal.  Otherwise, I'll need to move on to other interested buyers."", ""product_price"": 925000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** I'm framing this as my final offer to increase the pressure on Bob.
* **Higher Price:** $925,000 is a significant increase from Bob's last offer but still below my minimum price.
* **Value and Commitment:** I highlight both the value of the product and Bob's commitment, implying a limited window of opportunity.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, I've successfully secured a good price.
* If Bob rejects, I will sell the product to John for $1,000,000.  The risk of further negotiation is too high, and John provides a guaranteed price that is more beneficial to me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that this is your final offer, but I'm still not comfortable going above $875,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and pay $900,000 for the product. This is my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Risk outweighs reward:**  Bob's offer of $900,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. 
* **No room for negotiation:** It's likely that further negotiation with Bob will be unproductive, and I risk losing John as a buyer.
* **Guaranteed profit:** John offers a guaranteed profit of $1,000,000, which is significantly higher than what I can achieve with Bob.

**Next Steps:**

* I will sell the product to John to secure the guaranteed $1,000,000 profit. 
*  The time and effort required to negotiate further with Bob is not worth the potential loss in profit."
