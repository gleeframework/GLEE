"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in this product, $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for it. This is a fair price that reflects the potential value to me, and it allows us to both walk away satisfied. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
