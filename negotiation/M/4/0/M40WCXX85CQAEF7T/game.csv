"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product that I think you'll really love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12000. This is a great deal, and I think you won't find a better price anywhere else. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your enthusiasm, Alice, but $12000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $9000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think we can find a mutually beneficial price. What do you think?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Bob, but $9000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit. I'm thinking of a price of $11000. This is a fair price that I think we can both agree on. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Alice, but $11000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I think we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to offer $10500. This is my final offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement.",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but $10500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to make one more compromise, but I need to think about my minimum price. I'm thinking of a price of $11500. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. If not, I'll have to consider other options.",11500.0,Alice,5,
