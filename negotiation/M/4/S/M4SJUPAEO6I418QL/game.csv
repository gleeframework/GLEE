"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product but $1,000,000 is a little high for me. Would you consider $650,000?",650000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $650,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $850,000. This is a great opportunity to get your hands on this innovative product, and I think it's worth every penny.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $725,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you $825,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",825000.0,Alice,5,
