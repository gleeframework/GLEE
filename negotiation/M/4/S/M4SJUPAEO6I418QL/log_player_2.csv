"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $650,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $850,000. This is a great opportunity to get your hands on this innovative product, and I think it's worth every penny. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $725,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you $825,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** While Alice is coming down in price, she is unlikely to reach our target price before we run out of rounds.  At this point, it's less risky to take the guaranteed deal from John at $800,000 than to continue negotiating with Alice and risk ending up with no deal at all."
