Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $14,000. I believe it offers significant value, even at that price. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** We want to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($12,000) as possible without going below our minimum ($15,000).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $14,000 leaves some wiggle room if Bob tries to negotiate down.  
* **Alternative Buyer:** We have a guaranteed sale at $15,000 from John, so there's no pressure to accept a lowball offer from Bob. 

This strategy aims to secure a sale above our minimum while still making the offer attractive enough for Bob to consider."
