Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're looking to pay a bit less, but I'm still looking to get a good price for the product. I'm willing to meet you in the middle and offer it to you for $12500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair compromise considering the product's value to you.

If he fails, he can still buy the product from John for $15,000.  Bob has shown a willingness to negotiate and has proven he's not afraid to walk away, so there's still potential for a better deal."
