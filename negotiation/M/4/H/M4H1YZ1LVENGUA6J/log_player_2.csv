"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product, and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $130 to start. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's initial offer is too high. We have room to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $130 is a bit steep for me. Could you do it for $100?"",
""product_price"": 100
}
```

**Reasoning:** 

* **Aim low but reasonable:** We start with an ambitious counteroffer at Alice's value ($100). While it's unlikely she'll accept immediately, it sets a strong anchor for the negotiation.
* **Polite and direct:**  We maintain a positive tone to encourage a good negotiating relationship."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. How about we split the difference and meet at $115? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still room for negotiation:** While $115 is better, we're aiming to get as close to $100 as possible. There's room for further negotiation.
* **Alice is willing to move:**  Alice reducing her price indicates she's open to negotiation. We can likely get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice. How about $105? That's a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 105
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental increase:**  We're moving closer to Alice's price in smaller increments to signal seriousness and find a middle ground.
* **Justification:** Providing a reason for the counteroffer (""fair compromise"") can make it more persuasive.
* **Maintaining positivity:** We continue with a friendly and appreciative tone."
