"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I believe will be of great value to you. My initial offer is $14,000.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. I want to see if I can get close to my minimum price of $15,000. If Bob rejects, I'll be prepared to counter with a lower price.  I'm also keeping John in mind, knowing I can always get $15,000 from him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product you're selling. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $10,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  While I'm open to negotiation, I'm not willing to drop that low this early in the process.  I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer and see if we can find some common ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $10,000 is a bit too far below my minimum.  How about we meet in the middle?  I'm willing to go down to $12,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $11,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $11,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still a bit low. I believe there's room for further negotiation, and I'm not ready to settle just yet.  I'll see if I can push for a higher price in the next round. I'm also mindful that John is always an option, offering a guaranteed $15,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm still hoping we can find a price that works for both of us.  I'm willing to go down to $11,500.  This is a significant compromise on my end, but I'm eager to close this deal.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 11500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your continued flexibility, Alice. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $11,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

We're nearing the end of the negotiation, and Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price.  While I'm open to compromise, I'm not willing to go lower than $15,000. Since John is a guaranteed buyer at that price, it's time to stop the negotiation with Bob and sell to John.  This ensures I achieve my minimum desired profit and avoids further rounds of potentially unsuccessful negotiations."
