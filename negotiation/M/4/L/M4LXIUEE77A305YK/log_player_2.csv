While $100 is a good deal, it's still above your maximum price point. You can likely negotiate a better price with Alice."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob! I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $110. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit on this sale. Would you be open to that price?

While Alice has come down from $100 to $110, it's still above your maximum price point of $120.  It's worth trying to negotiate further to see if you can get a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to stay under $100, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $95 and $110, which would be $102.50. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair price for both of us.

While Alice's offer is getting closer to your ideal price, $102.50 is still above your maximum price point of $120. It's worth trying one more time to negotiate a lower price, as you are very close to your desired range."
