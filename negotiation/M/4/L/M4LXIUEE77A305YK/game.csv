"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I really appreciate it. However, $100 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay at the moment.  Would you be open to $90? I'm really interested in the product, and I think this price would be fair for both of us.",90.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the offer, Bob! I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $110. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit on this sale. Would you be open to that price?",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $110 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm really hoping to stay under $100.  Would you be willing to consider $95? It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can make this deal work.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to stay under $100, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $95 and $110, which would be $102.50. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair price for both of us.",102.5,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  I'm really close to my budget, and I'm hoping we can find a solution.  Would you consider $100? It's a fair compromise for both of us, and it would allow me to move forward with the purchase.",100.0,Bob,6,
