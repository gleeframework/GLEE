Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's worth significantly more to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:**  $12,000 is higher than your minimum of $8,000, so you're already making a profit.
* **It's below Bob's value:**  $12,000 is lower than what the product is worth to Bob ($15,000), so it's likely he'll be interested.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  You can still increase the price if Bob accepts, or you can negotiate further if he makes a counteroffer.

Remember, this is just the initial offer. Be prepared to adjust your strategy based on Bob's response."
