"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I really appreciate your enthusiasm. However, $90 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $75? I'm very interested in this product, and I think $75 is a fair price for both of us.",75.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $90 might be a bit steep for you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $82. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",82.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $82 is still a little too high for me.  I'm ready to close the deal right now at $80.  That's the absolute most I can spend, and it's a fair price for both of us.  Let's make this happen!",80.0,Bob,4,
