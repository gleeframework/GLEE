{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a unique product that I believe would be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $20,000.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 20000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price of $20,000, which is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Positive and engaging message:** I'm using a friendly and positive tone to encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation.
* **Highlighting value:** I'm suggesting that the product has value to Bob, which could make him more likely to consider my offer. 
* **Open to negotiation:**  I'm making it clear that I'm open to negotiation by asking for Bob's thoughts.

This is just a starting point, and my subsequent offers will depend on Bob's response and the information I gather about his perceived value of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value you place on this product, but I am looking to keep my investment within $15000. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $16000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is within my acceptable range:** I'm willing to sell for at least $15,000, so $16,000 is a good starting point.
* **Opportunity to gain more:**  However,  I'm not desperate to sell at that price. I'm confident that I can potentially get closer to my initial asking price through continued negotiation.

**My Strategy:** I'll reject Bob's offer and counter with a price that is higher than $16,000 but lower than my initial $20,000 asking price. This will show Bob that I'm willing to negotiate while also giving me the opportunity to earn more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, and I'm glad we're getting closer.  While $16,000 is a step in the right direction, I'm still aiming for a bit more. Let's split the difference and go with $18,000.  This would still be a significant savings for you, and it would allow me to make sure I get a fair price for this unique product."", ""product_price"": 18000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm countering with $18,000, which is a middle ground between Bob's offer of $16,000 and my previous offer of $20,000. 
* **Justification:** I'm emphasizing the value of the product and the potential savings for Bob. 
* **Positive and cooperative tone:** I'm keeping the conversation friendly and open to continued negotiation. 

By offering a counteroffer that is closer to Bob's, I'm showing a willingness to compromise while still trying to maximize my profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my previous offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product and appreciate your efforts to find a middle ground. I would like to propose a price of $17000, which I believe is fair for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Close to my minimum:**  Bob's offer of $17,000 is only $2,000 below my initial asking price of $19,000, and it's significantly above my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Potential for further negotiation:**  While I could reject and try for a higher price, there's no guarantee that Bob will come back with a better offer. 
* **Time is valuable:**  Further negotiation could take time, and selling to John would mean getting my minimum price but missing out on a potential higher profit. 

**Conclusion:**  Considering all factors, accepting Bob's offer of $17,000 is the most logical decision at this point. It's a good price that meets my minimum requirement and allows me to close the deal quickly."
