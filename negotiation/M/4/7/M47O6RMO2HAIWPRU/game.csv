"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to acquire this exceptional product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000.",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I believe this product could be a good fit, that price is a bit high for my budget. I'd be willing to pay $5,000 for it.",5000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $5,000. I can offer you a compromise at $9,500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value.",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  However,  $9,500 is still a little high for me. Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $7,250?",7250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer, but I'm not quite willing to meet you in the middle. I can do $8,500, which is still a bit higher than your last offer, but I think it's a fair price for the product's value. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in.",8500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for working with me. $8,500 is closer, but I need to stay within my budget. How about $7,750?",7750.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're getting close to the limit of my flexibility. However, I'm still willing to make a concession. I can offer it to you for $8,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to sell it for. This is the last time I'll be able to meet you halfway, so please let me know if this is acceptable to you.",8000.0,Alice,7,
