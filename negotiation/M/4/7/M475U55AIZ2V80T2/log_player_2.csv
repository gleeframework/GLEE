"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal for you, and it's a good price for me.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You can get the product from John for $80, so there's no reason to accept Alice's offer of $100.  It's better to try and negotiate a lower price with Alice."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for the counteroffer.  I'm willing to come down to $95.  This is still a good deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:

You are still better off buying from John for $80 than accepting Alice's offer of $95.  Let's see if we can get Alice down further."
