{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal for you, and it's a good price for me.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 
 
This offer is a starting point. I'm aiming for a price closer to my value of $120, but I'm also trying to be reasonable and make it worthwhile for Bob.  If he rejects, I'll adjust my offer based on his counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, $100 is a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $85 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $85 is closer to my minimum value of $120, I'm still not happy with that price.  I'm going to counter with a price closer to $100 to see if we can meet in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for the counteroffer.  I'm willing to come down to $95.  This is still a good deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. However, $95 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $85. Let's see if we can find a compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is persistent with his $85 offer, which is significantly lower than my minimum value of $120. I'm not willing to go lower than $95, but it seems like we're at an impasse.  John is a guaranteed sale at $120, so it's better to sell to him and avoid further negotiation with Bob."
