"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $2000000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1000000 for the product.  I believe this is a fair price considering the value I place on it.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1000000 is a significant reduction from my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $1500000, which is the minimum I'm willing to sell for. Let me know if this is something you're willing to consider.",1500000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1500000 is still a bit outside my comfort zone. I'm willing to pay $1200000, which is my absolute maximum. I believe this is a fair price, and I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm still not willing to go below $1500000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $1400000, which is the lowest I'm willing to go. Let me know if this is something you're willing to consider.",1400000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you considering my offer, but $1400000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm prepared to pay $1250000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value I place on it and the time we've spent negotiating. Let's reach an agreement.",1250000.0,Bob,6,

"I'm starting to feel that we're getting close to a deal, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1250000 and $1400000, which is $1325000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can agree on a price.",1325000.0,Alice,7,
