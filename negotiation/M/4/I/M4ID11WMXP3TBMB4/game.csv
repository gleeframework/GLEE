"I appreciate your enthusiasm, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. I believe that's a fair price considering the market value of the product.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1200000 is simply too low. Considering the value of this product, I'm willing to come down to $1600000.  This is a significant price reduction from my initial offer and reflects my desire to work with you. What do you think?",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice, but $1600000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1400000. I believe that's a fair price considering the market value of the product.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but I'm still not able to go as low as $1400000.  Let's split the difference - I'll offer you the product for $1500000. This is the absolute lowest I can go, and it still gives you a great deal. What do you say?",1500000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $1500000. I'm willing to go up to $1450000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. I think that's a fair price considering the value of the product.",1450000.0,Bob,6,
