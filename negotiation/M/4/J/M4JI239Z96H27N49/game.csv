"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $11,500. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else.",11500.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested in the product, but $11,500 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $11,500 might be a bit high for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11,000. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll really love the product at this price.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  How about we split the difference again and settle at $10,500?",10500.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're trying to find a middle ground, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go down to $10,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I'll compromise at $10,750. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",10750.0,Alice,5,
