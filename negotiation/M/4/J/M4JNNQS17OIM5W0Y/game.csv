"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I do like the product, $15,000 is quite a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to pay $6,000, which I think is fair considering the market value.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $15,000 is a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6,000. How about we meet in the middle at $10,000? I think that's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",10000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you working with me on the price, Alice. While $10,000 is closer, it's still a bit higher than I'd like to go.  Could we settle on $7,000? ",7000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob. I can see you're willing to pay $7,000, but I'm still not willing to go that low. Let's try to find a compromise. How about we meet at $9,000? It's a bit higher than your offer, but I think it's still a fair price for this unique product.",9000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're definitely getting closer!  I'm willing to budge a little more. How about $7,500? That's a firm offer, and I think it's more than fair.",7500.0,Bob,6,

"I can see you're serious about buying the product, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $7,500. Let's try to find a sweet spot. How about we meet at $8,500? It's a bit higher than your offer, but I think it's still a reasonable price for this product.",8500.0,Alice,7,
