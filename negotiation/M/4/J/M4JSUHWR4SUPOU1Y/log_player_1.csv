"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and think it would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $120 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price significantly higher than my minimum but still below the value Bob places on the product. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Friendly Tone:** I'm being polite and trying to build rapport to increase the chance of a successful deal.
* **Direct Offer:** I'm stating the price upfront and leaving it open for Bob to respond."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but I'm only willing to pay $100 for it right now.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value vs. Risk:** While $100 is significantly better than selling to John, I believe I can still get a better price from Bob. He's shown interest and the product is worth more to him.
* **Negotiation Strategy:** Rejecting his offer keeps the negotiation open and allows me to make a counteroffer that might lead to a more favorable outcome.
* **Room to Compromise:** I have room to lower my price a bit more without going below my minimum acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $100 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $110.  Let's make this happen! "", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing flexibility by lowering my price from my initial offer.
* **Positive Framing:** I'm focusing on reaching an agreement with Bob. 
* **Maintain Margin:** $110 still leaves me with a decent profit while still being attractive to Bob."
