"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and think it would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $120 for it.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* Bob's goal is to save money and the product is worth $150 to him.
* Alice's offer is $120, which is a good starting point, but Bob can likely get a better deal.
*  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to negotiate and potentially lower the price further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but I'm only willing to pay $100 for it right now.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Bob is trying to get a good deal, and $100 is a significant discount from Alice's initial offer. 
* This counteroffer is still within Bob's budget and shows a willingness to negotiate.
* It's a good starting point for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $100 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $110.  Let's make this happen!  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* Bob's goal is to save money, and Alice's offer of $110 is a good deal. 
* It's significantly lower than the initial offer and still within Bob's budget.
* While Bob could potentially try to negotiate further, accepting the offer ensures he gets the product at a reasonable price without risking losing it to John."
