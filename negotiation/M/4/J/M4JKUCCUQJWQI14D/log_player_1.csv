"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product! Given its value to you, I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. My initial offer is $1,400,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,300,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
 
The product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob, and $1,000,000 to John. As I have 10 rounds, there is still room to negotiate with Bob. I want to try to secure a higher price, so I'll reject Bob's offer and counter in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm looking for a price closer to my initial proposal.  I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This price still reflects the value of the product, and allows us both to walk away happy. Let's find common ground!"", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I'm glad we're making progress. I would like to counter with a price of $1,325,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,325,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, I still believe I can get a better deal. We're already on round 4 and I have a good chance of closing the deal with Bob. It's worth rejecting and seeing if I can get him closer to my asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,325,000 is still a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $1,337,500? This would give us both a good outcome. Let's get this deal done!"", ""product_price"": 1337500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your effort, Alice. I think $1,330,000 would be a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,330,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,330,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd prefer a higher price, it's getting close to the end of the negotiation rounds. Bob's offer of $1,330,000 is still significantly more than what I can get from John, and it's likely I won't be able to secure a better price with Bob in the remaining rounds. It's time to accept and finalize the deal."
