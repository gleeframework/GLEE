"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'd like to offer you a great deal on this product, valued at $15,000 to you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $14,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

While Alice's offer of $14,000 is tempting, you know you have a backup option to buy the product from John for $15,000.  There's a chance you could negotiate a better price with Alice or she might improve her offer if she's eager to sell."
