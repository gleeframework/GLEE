"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product.  I believe it has tremendous value for you, and I'm confident you'll find it to be a game-changer. I'm asking for $1,150,000 for it.  Let's see if we can strike a deal!",1150000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe it's a great product, but I need to stay within my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer, but $900,000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  How about we split the difference?  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and allows me to make this transaction worth my while.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you think the product is worth more than $900,000, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $950,000. Can we meet in the middle at $1,025,000?",1025000.0,Bob,4,
