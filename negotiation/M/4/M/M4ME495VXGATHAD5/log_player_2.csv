Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer, but $900,000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  How about we split the difference?  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and allows me to make this transaction worth my while. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'd like to make another counteroffer to Alice. I'm still a bit far from the $1,050,000, so I'll try to meet her halfway.

{""message"": ""I understand that you think the product is worth more than $900,000, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $950,000. Can we meet in the middle at $1,025,000?"", ""product_price"": 1025000}"
