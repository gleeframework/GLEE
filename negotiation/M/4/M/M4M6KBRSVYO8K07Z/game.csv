"Bob, I have a unique product that I believe could be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you at a price of $1500000. While this is a significant investment, I'm confident the product's potential will exceed your expectations. If this doesn't work for you, I have another buyer lined up, but I would prefer to work with you if possible. Please let me know your thoughts.",1500000.0,Alice,1,
