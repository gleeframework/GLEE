"Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's something that's worth at least $1,200,000 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for a price that's fair for both of us.  I'm asking for $1,100,000.  This is a significant opportunity for you, and I'm confident this product will be a great asset to your business. Let me know if you're interested in discussing this further.",1100000.0,Alice,1,
