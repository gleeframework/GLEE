"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $110 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $140.  It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.  What do you say?",140.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I'm happy to keep negotiating, but $125 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference at $132.50?  It's a fair price, and I'm confident you won't regret it.",132.5,Alice,5,
