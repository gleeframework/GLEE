Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $130. I believe it's a great deal considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
 
Let me know what Bob says! I'll continue to negotiate as Alice to get the best possible price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $130 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $115.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Bob's offer of $115 is still quite a bit lower than my target price. I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm not going to settle for such a low offer right away.  Let's see if we can meet somewhere in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""I appreciate your interest, Bob.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $115 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $125?  That's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 125}"
