"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $1100000. This is a competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's a good price, it's still above Bob's maximum budget. By rejecting the offer, Bob can counter with a lower price and potentially get a better deal. There's a chance Alice might be willing to come down in price, especially since she values the product at $1,200,000.  It's also worth considering that Bob has a guaranteed alternative with John at $1,000,000, giving him leverage in the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $1,100,000 is a bit above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. This reflects my maximum value for it, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter Offer:** Bob starts the negotiation by offering a price significantly lower than Alice's initial offer. This shows he's serious about getting a good deal.
* **Reasoning:** The counteroffer of $950,000 leaves room for negotiation. It's still above Bob's maximum budget, so he's willing to pay more than John but not too much.
* **Communication:** The message is polite and respectful, highlighting the value for both parties.  It also emphasizes Bob's budget constraint to justify the lower offer.

**Next Steps:**  Now the negotiation is in Alice's hands. She can either accept Bob's offer or counter with her own price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $950000 is your maximum budget, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1050000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it's a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's counter-offer of $1,050,000 is within Bob's budget and represents a good compromise.  While Bob could try to negotiate further, the risk of Alice rejecting another offer is high, and the potential savings are minimal. Accepting the offer allows Bob to secure the product while staying within his budget."
