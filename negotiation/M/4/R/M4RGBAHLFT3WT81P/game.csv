"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a unique asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000. What are your thoughts?",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer. However, I have done some market research and  believe that $1,100,000 is a bit high. I'm willing to offer you $650,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price that reflects its true market value.",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you've done some research, but I believe the product's value is higher than what you're offering. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $900,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and my minimum sale price.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, $900,000 is still a bit beyond what I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to increase my offer to $725,000. This represents a significant investment on my part, and I believe it's a fair compromise.",725000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to consider your offer, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm counteroffering at $950,000. This is a compromise, but it's still a significant discount from my original offer.",950000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, and I'm still very interested in the product. However, the price difference remains a significant obstacle. To bridge the gap, I'm proposing $775,000. This demonstrates my commitment to finding a mutually beneficial agreement.",775000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to find a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to make one final concession. I'm counteroffering at $975,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",975000.0,Alice,7,
