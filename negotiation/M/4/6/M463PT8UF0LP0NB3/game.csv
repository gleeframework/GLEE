"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with an offer of $10000. What are your thoughts?",10000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However,  $10000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to pay $9000 for the product. Let's see if we can find a compromise.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $9000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm now offering the product to you for $9500. This is a fair price considering the value the product holds for you, and I believe it's a good compromise.",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $9500 is still a bit more than I'm prepared to spend. I'm willing to offer $9250, which is a fair price given the potential value to me. Let's reach a deal!",9250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm getting closer to your price, Bob, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you at $9500 was a bit too high, but $9250 is a good starting point. I'll meet you halfway between that and my previous offer. I'll offer the product to you for $9375. Let's see if we can seal the deal!",9375.0,Alice,5,
