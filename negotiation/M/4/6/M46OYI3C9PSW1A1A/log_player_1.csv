Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable.  Given its unique features and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000.  I'm open to discussing this further, so please let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1100000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm beginning the negotiation significantly above Bob's perceived value but below my minimum. This leaves room for negotiation while aiming for a highly profitable outcome.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  The message explicitly mentions openness to discussion, signaling to Bob that I'm willing to adjust my initial price.
* **Alternative Option:**  While I haven't mentioned John directly, knowing I have a guaranteed buyer at my minimum price gives me a strong position in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product you're offering. However, given my budget constraints, I am only willing to consider a price within the range of $800,000 to $900,000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $850,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob's counteroffer is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price. While his range shows some willingness to negotiate, accepting $850,000 would be a substantial loss compared to what John is offering. I need to signal that his initial range is too low while still encouraging further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and understand your budget considerations. However, the value of this product is significantly higher than your proposed range.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000.  This is a significant concession on my part, reflecting my desire to find a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant but Measured Reduction:** I've made a substantial decrease from my initial price to show flexibility but remain firmly above both Bob's offer and his stated range. 
* **Emphasizing Value:** I'm reiterating the product's high value, aiming to shift Bob's perception of its worth.
* **Seeking Middle Ground:**  While I haven't met Bob in the middle, my counteroffer suggests a willingness to negotiate toward a more reasonable price point. 
* **John in the Background:** I'm still holding onto John's offer, giving me leverage if Bob's counteroffers remain too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. While I understand the value of the product, I still feel that we might be able to reach a better agreement within my budget. I am willing to consider a price of $950,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Reaching the Limit:** Bob's latest offer, while a step in the right direction, is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price.  
* **Diminishing Returns:** Further negotiation seems unlikely to close the gap significantly. Bob is unlikely to suddenly jump to a price point above $1,000,000. 
* **Guaranteed Profit:** John's offer provides a guaranteed $1,200,000, which is a substantial profit and worth more than the risk of continued negotiation with Bob. 

It's time to cut my losses with Bob and secure the excellent deal with John."
