"Thanks for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the suggestion, but I'm looking to keep my spending within $10,000. Would you be able to lower the price?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I'm willing to negotiate, $10,000 is simply too low for me. I can offer you the product for $11,500. This price still gives you a good deal, and it's closer to my desired price. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating, but $10,500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,000, which is a fair compromise.  This price reflects the value of the product and also allows you to stay within a reasonable budget.  Let me know what you think.",11000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob,  I appreciate your persistence, but I need to be realistic about my minimum price. While I want to work with you, I can't go lower than $10,750.  This is a fair compromise that allows me to cover my costs and still provides you with a good deal.  Let's see if we can finally come to an agreement.",10750.0,Alice,7,
