Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you a fantastic opportunity to acquire a unique product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering its worth to both of us. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's valuation ($1,500,000) as possible. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $1,400,000 allows some wiggle room if Bob tries to negotiate down. 
* **Secure a Significant Gain:** Even if Bob negotiates down slightly, selling at this price point still yields a much higher profit than selling to John for $1,200,000. 

This strategy balances ambition with the need to secure a deal that is significantly better than the guaranteed backup option."
