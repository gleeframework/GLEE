Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While Bob's offer is higher than what John is offering, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'll reject his offer and try to get closer to my target price."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate your interest, Bob.  $90 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $102.50?"", ""product_price"": 102.5}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the compromise, but I'm still a bit short on budget. How about we meet at $97.50? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $97.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $97.5

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, but I'm still not satisfied.  I'll reject it and try to push for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $97.50 is still a bit too low. How about $100? That way, I can sell it to you and still make a reasonable profit."", ""product_price"": 100}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but I'm still a bit short on budget. How about we meet at $99? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $99. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $99
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting very close to my minimum, but it's still not enough to justify risking further negotiation.  Selling to John for $100 ensures I make a profit, and I can't risk potentially going even lower with Bob."
