Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm offering you my product for $115. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for several reasons:

* **It's above Bob's value:**  $115 is higher than Bob's perceived value of $100, but it leaves room for negotiation.
* **It's below your minimum:**  $115 is still above your minimum acceptable price of $120, giving you some wiggle room if Bob counters.
* **It's a reasonable price:**  It's not too aggressive, which could make Bob feel pressured, but it's also not too low, which could make you seem desperate.

This strategy aims to find a price that is acceptable to both parties while maximizing your profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate it. I'm willing to pay $100 for the product. Let me know if this works for you! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While selling to Bob for $100 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. It's more strategic to reject his offer and try to get closer to my desired price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer.  I appreciate you showing interest. While I value your business, $100 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $110. This would still give you a good deal, and it's closer to what I need to get for the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand, Alice. Thank you for adjusting your offer. I'm still interested in purchasing the product, so I'm willing to pay $105. Let me know if this works for you! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $105 is a little closer to my minimum, it's still not enough. I'm comfortable with the offer from John for $120, which meets my minimum requirement. I don't want to risk losing John's offer by continuing to negotiate with Bob."
