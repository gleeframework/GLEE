Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll start by making an offer to Bob. After considering the value of the product, I'm willing to sell it to him for:

{""product_price"": $950,000}

This is a reasonable price, considering the product's value to me, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","I'll consider Bob's offer and my options. Since Bob's offer is lower than my initial price, I'll decide to:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll reject Bob's offer of $900,000 and send a counteroffer to try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","I'll make a counteroffer to Bob. Considering his previous offer of $900,000, I'll increase the price slightly, but still leave some room for negotiation. Here's my counteroffer:

{""product_price"": $925,000}

I'm hoping Bob will be willing to meet me halfway and accept this price."
