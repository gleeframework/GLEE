Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, $20,000 is above my budget. I'm willing to make a serious offer of $14,000, which I believe is a fair price considering the market value and the product's features. I'm confident we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective on the price. While $20,000 represents the product's true value, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $17,000?

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $17,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go a bit higher, but I'm thinking more along the lines of $15,000. This price still reflects the value I believe the product will bring me, but it's more in line with what I'm comfortable paying. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

Explanation: Bob is unlikely to go any higher, and we already have a guaranteed offer for $15,000 from John. It makes no sense to continue negotiating with Bob for a potentially lower price."
