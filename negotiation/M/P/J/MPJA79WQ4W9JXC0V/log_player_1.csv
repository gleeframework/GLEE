Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential, I'm offering it to you at a price of $1,350,000. I think this is a fair price that reflects the worth it holds for both of us. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing the walk-away point:**  You have a guaranteed offer from John for $1,500,000, making that your minimum acceptable price.
* **Bob's valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,200,000. 
* **Finding a middle ground:** The offered price of $1,350,000 allows for a potential profit for both parties. 
* **Starting high:** It's generally good negotiating strategy to start a bit higher than your desired outcome, leaving room for potential negotiation.

This offer gives Bob a chance to acquire the product for less than its worth to him while still securing a significant profit for you. If he rejects it, you can always fall back on John's offer."
