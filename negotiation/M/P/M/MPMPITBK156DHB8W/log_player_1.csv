Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1800000} 
```

I'm starting high, at $1,800,000. This is above Bob's perceived value, but it gives me room to negotiate.  I'm confident that I can secure a better price than John's offer, which is my fallback option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, but I'm not ready to settle yet. I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can get him closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000} 
```

I'm countering with $1,600,000. It's a compromise, but I'm still holding out for more than Bob's offer.  This price is closer to his perceived value, and hopefully, it will lead to a quick agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, but it's still too low. At this point, I'm starting to think I won't be able to get a better price from Bob. I'm better off taking John's offer to secure a higher price and avoid further negotiation."
