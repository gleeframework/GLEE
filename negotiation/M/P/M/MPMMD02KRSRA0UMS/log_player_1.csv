Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm offering a price of $1,000,000, which is higher than Bob's perceived value of $800,000 but still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** This leaves room for Bob to counteroffer, allowing for a potential negotiation.
* **Protecting My Interest:** If Bob rejects the offer, I can always fall back on John's offer of $1,200,000. 

This strategy aims to maximize my potential earnings while keeping the negotiation open."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $950,000 is a decent price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  I'm confident Bob values the product enough that he'll likely make further counteroffers.  By rejecting his current offer, I maintain leverage and keep the negotiation open."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 980000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** I'm increasing my offer to $980,000, showing willingness to compromise. This is only $30,000 below Bob's offer, demonstrating that I'm taking his counteroffer seriously.
* **Maintaining Leverage:** It's still below my minimum acceptable price, leaving room for further negotiation while also showing Bob that I'm not desperate to sell.
* **Strategic Increment:** This small increment encourages Bob to accept, as he's likely to see the potential for a successful deal. 

This approach aims to strike a balance between securing a better price than Bob's initial offer while keeping the negotiation moving towards a potential agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $940,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $940,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $940,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below it.  At this point, the negotiation seems to be stalling, and it's possible that further rounds with Bob might result in even lower offers.  To guarantee a price that meets my minimum, I'm choosing to sell to John, ensuring I receive my desired $1,200,000."
