"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $90 is your maximum budget, but I'm still looking to get a good price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $105. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product at this price.",105.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I'm still not willing to go below $105, as that's the minimum I need to make a profit. However, I'm willing to compromise further. I'll offer you a deal at $102.50. It's a small step closer to your desired price, and I think it's a fair compromise.",102.5,Alice,5,
