Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $12,000.
* **Bob's Value:** Bob values the product at $10,000.
* **Your Guarantee:** You have a guaranteed sale of $12,000 from John.

**Strategy**

Since you have a guaranteed buyer at your minimum price, you have leverage. The goal is to see if Bob is willing to pay a price that's beneficial for you, knowing you have a fallback option.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product before I open it up to other buyers. I've set the price at $13,500. This is a unique product, and I believe it offers significant value. Let me know what you think."",
""product_price"": 13500
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Higher Starting Point:** We start above both your minimum and Bob's perceived value. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Justification:**  We subtly highlight the product's value and the exclusive nature of the offer. This could make Bob more amenable to paying a premium.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone suggests you're open to hearing Bob's thoughts, leaving the door open for a counteroffer. 

**Possible Outcomes**

* **Bob Accepts:** You make a profit above your guarantee.
* **Bob Negotiates:** You can counter, potentially settling at a price higher than $12,000.
* **Bob Rejects:** You sell to John at your guaranteed price.

**Important:** This is just one strategy. You can adjust the price and message based on your assessment of Bob's personality and negotiating style."
