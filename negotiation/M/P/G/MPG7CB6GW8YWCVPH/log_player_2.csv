"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product before I open it up to other buyers. I've set the price at $13,500. This is a unique product, and I believe it offers significant value. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

Alice's offer is too high. You have a better option available by buying from John for $10,000, which is within your budget and saves you $3,500."
