Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This is a good starting point as it's significantly higher than my minimum price of $10,000, but it leaves room for negotiation if Bob is interested."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to reject his offer and try to get closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm offering $12,000, which is still higher than Bob's offer but closer to his price point.  This shows flexibility and might encourage him to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $10,000 is my minimum acceptable price. While I could try to negotiate further, there's no guarantee that Bob will increase his offer, and I risk losing the sale entirely.  Accepting his offer ensures a sale at my minimum price."
