"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it has tremendous value and I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's worth to you is $1,500,000, but I'm willing to make a concession to get the deal done. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. While it's a good starting point, I'm looking to pay closer to $700,000.  This product is valuable to me, but I need to stay within my budget.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to offer you a price of $850,000. This is still a significant discount from the original price, and I believe it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still a bit higher than my target price, but I'm willing to go up to $750,000. This is a fair price that allows me to stay within my budget, while also giving you a decent profit. Let's see if we can close this deal.",750000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're willing to go up to $750,000, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for that price. I'm willing to offer you a price of $825,000. This is the highest price I'm willing to go, and I believe it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,5,
