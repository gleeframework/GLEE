Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

This offer is a good starting point. It's significantly higher than your minimum of $800,000, leaving room for negotiation, but it's also below Bob's value of $1,200,000, giving him a reason to consider accepting. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  $950,000 is closer to my minimum, but I think I can still get a bit more. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 975000} 
```

I'm offering $975,000. This is a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer, showing that I'm willing to negotiate, but I still want to get closer to my ideal price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $960,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $960,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While it's still a bit lower than my initial goal, it's getting very close, and continuing to negotiate might risk losing the deal altogether.  $960,000 is a good compromise and a solid profit for me."
