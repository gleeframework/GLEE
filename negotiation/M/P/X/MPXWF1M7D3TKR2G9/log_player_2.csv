"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be incredibly valuable to your portfolio. Given its potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,300,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  It's above Bob's maximum budget of $1,500,000, and he wants to save as much money as possible.
* **Negotiation is worthwhile.**  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price.  There's a good chance Alice will be willing to drop her price, as she values the product at $800,000. 
* **John's offer is a fallback.**  Bob can always buy from John if negotiations with Alice fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm very interested in the product, but $1,300,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to pay $1,000,000 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Counteroffer:** Bob's offer is a substantial reduction from Alice's initial price. This shows his seriousness in buying the product but also his desire for a significant discount. 
* **Within Budget:**  $1,000,000 is within Bob's maximum budget and leaves room for further negotiation if necessary.
* **Appealing to Alice:**  The offer is still profitable for Alice, considering her valuation of $800,000. This makes the offer more likely to be accepted."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer.  While I'm eager to find a deal that works for us, $1,000,000 undervalues the product's potential. Would you consider $1,175,000? This reflects a willingness to negotiate while still recognizing the true value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,175,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,175,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above Bob's Target:** $1,175,000 is still higher than what Bob wants to pay. He's aiming to save as much money as possible.
* **Negotiation Room:** There's still potential to negotiate further. Alice has shown flexibility by dropping her price from $1,300,000, and Bob can likely get her to go lower.
* **Avoiding John's Price:**  While John offers the product at $1,500,000, Bob can get a better deal through further negotiation with Alice."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,175,000 is closer, it's still a bit high for me. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  I'd like to offer $1,100,000.  This reflects the value I see in the product while staying within my budget."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Reduction:**  Bob is reducing the price further, but in a way that suggests he is serious about finding a compromise. 
* **Staying Within Range:**  $1,100,000 is still a significant profit for Alice, considering her valuation of $800,000. 
* **Emphasizing Shared Benefit:**  The message highlights that Bob is looking for a deal that works for both parties, increasing the likelihood of Alice accepting."
