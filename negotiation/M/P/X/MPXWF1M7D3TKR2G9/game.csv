"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm very interested in the product, but $1,300,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to pay $1,000,000 for it. Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer.  While I'm eager to find a deal that works for us, $1,000,000 undervalues the product's potential. Would you consider $1,175,000? This reflects a willingness to negotiate while still recognizing the true value of the product.",1175000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,175,000 is closer, it's still a bit high for me. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  I'd like to offer $1,100,000.  This reflects the value I see in the product while staying within my budget.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
