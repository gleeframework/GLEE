"I understand that $180 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I have to make a living, and $80 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $120.",120.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you're serious about the product, Bob, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I've already met you halfway at $120, and I'm not willing to go any lower than that. I'm willing to make one more compromise, so I'll meet you at $110.",110.0,Alice,5,
