# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone like you, and I'm confident you'll find it highly beneficial. Given its unique features and potential, I'm offering it to you at a starting price of $1,350,000. I'm open to discussing this further, so please feel free to share your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above your maximum price of $1,000,000. It's better to reject and see if you can get a better price. There's still potential to negotiate with Alice or buy from John."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is a significant gap from where I see the value of this product.  To be fair to us both, I can come down to $1,275,000. I think this price reflects a more accurate representation of its true worth and potential return on investment for you.  What do you think?

Alice's offer of $1,275,000 is still above my maximum price of $1,000,000.  I'm not willing to pay that much, even though it's a lower price than before. I'll try to negotiate further or buy from John."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're getting closer. While I value finding common ground, I believe the product's inherent worth justifies a price closer to my previous offer. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,225,000.  This feels like a fair compromise that recognizes its value while acknowledging your interest.  Let me know your thoughts.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,225,000 is closer to my desired price, it's still above my maximum of $1,000,000.  It's getting late in the negotiation, and I don't want to risk Alice coming back with a higher offer or the negotiation going on indefinitely.  I'm confident that John will sell me the product for $1,000,000, so I'll take that deal and save myself the hassle."
