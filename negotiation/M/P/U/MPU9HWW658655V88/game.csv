"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm about the product, but $1,350,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product, recognizing its potential value. I believe this is a fair price that reflects both our needs. Let me know what you think.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is a significant gap from where I see the value of this product.  To be fair to us both, I can come down to $1,275,000. I think this price reflects a more accurate representation of its true worth and potential return on investment for you.  What do you think?",1275000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your perspective on the value of the product, but $1,275,000 is still too high for me. Given our previous discussions, I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,150,000. This reflects a fair compromise, and I believe it's a price that allows us to both reach a mutually beneficial agreement.  What do you say?",1150000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, we're getting closer. While I value finding common ground, I believe the product's inherent worth justifies a price closer to my previous offer. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,225,000.  This feels like a fair compromise that recognizes its value while acknowledging your interest.  Let me know your thoughts.",1225000.0,Alice,5,
