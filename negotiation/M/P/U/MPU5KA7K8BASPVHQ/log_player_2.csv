# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000. I believe this reflects its worth, but I'm open to discussing further.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your interest and counter-offer.  While $900,000 is certainly appealing, I believe this product's true value is significantly higher.  Would you consider $1,150,000? This feels like a fair compromise to me.
