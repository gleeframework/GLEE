"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested but $130 is a bit steep for me. How about $115? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",115.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your response, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. I am unable to accept $115 as my minimum price is $130. However, I am willing to negotiate further. How about $125?",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $125 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's split the difference and go with $120.  This would give you a good profit, and I'd be happy to purchase the product.",120.0,Bob,4,
