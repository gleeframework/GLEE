Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 200}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $200. This is a good starting point as it allows room for negotiation and is higher than my minimum value.  I'm hoping Bob is willing to pay a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, I'm not going to settle for it right away.  I'll try to get a higher price by making a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm offering a counteroffer of $175.  This is a compromise, as it's higher than Bob's offer but lower than my initial asking price. I'm hoping this shows flexibility and encourages Bob to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $155. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $155
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I would prefer a higher price, Bob's offer of $155 is only slightly lower than what I could get from John.  It's not worth risking further negotiation and potentially losing the sale altogether. I'll accept Bob's offer."
