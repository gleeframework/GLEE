Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. I know it's worth a lot to you, but this is a fair price considering its value to me.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:**  You're already making a profit of $4,000.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** Bob is likely to counteroffer, giving you the opportunity to potentially secure a higher price.
* **It's not too high:** A much higher offer might scare Bob off entirely."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit too steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $9,000 for it. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,000 is a decent profit, I'm aiming for a bit more.  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to continue negotiating and potentially secure a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is still a bit low for me.  How about $10,500?  That's a fair compromise considering the value of the product to both of us.  Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me. $10,500 is closer, but I'm still aiming for a bit lower. How about $9,750? I think that's a fair offer considering its value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $9,750 is only $250 less than my last counteroffer. At this point, it's likely that further negotiation won't get me a much higher price.  Accepting his offer is the best option to secure a decent profit and avoid risking the deal falling through."
