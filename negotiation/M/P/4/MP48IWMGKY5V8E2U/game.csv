"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting our conversation, I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'll sell it to you for $1200000. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $1200000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $900000. Can you consider that?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $900000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so I'll counter with a price of $1100000. This is the best I can do, considering the value this product brings. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet you halfway, but $1100000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $950000, but that's as high as I can go. Can you consider that?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $950000 is a significant concession, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle. However, I'm still not willing to go that low. I'll counter with a price of $1050000, which is the lowest I can go while still ensuring a fair return on my investment. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think that we're getting close, but I still need to make a significant reduction in price. I'm willing to go up to $925000, but that's my final offer. Can you consider that?",925000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal possible, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $925000. I'll counter with a price of $1025000, which is the absolute lowest I can go without losing money on this deal. What do you think?",1025000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to my limit, but I still need to make a significant reduction in price. I'm willing to go up to $900000, but that's my absolute final offer. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'll have to consider other options.",900000.0,Bob,8,

"Bob, I understand that you're making a serious commitment to this deal, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me at the table. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $900000. I'll counter with a price of $1010000, which is the best I can do. If you're willing to meet me here, I'll make it happen. If not, I'll have to consider other options.",1010000.0,Alice,9,
