"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but the price is a little high for me. Could you consider a lower price, perhaps closer to $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that the price is a bit high for you, but I have to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a bit more than that. I can offer you the product for $900,000. This is a fair price, considering the value it brings to you. Let me know if this is something you'd like to consider.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While $900,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch for my budget. How about we settle at $700,000? I think that's a fair compromise.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a price you're comfortable with. However, $700,000 is still a bit below my minimum. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target. I can offer you the product for $1,000,000. This is the best I can do, and I believe it's still a great value for you. Let me know if this is something you'd like to consider.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
