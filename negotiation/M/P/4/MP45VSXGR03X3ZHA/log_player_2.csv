# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that the price is a bit high for you, but I have to make a profit on this sale.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a price you're comfortable with. However, $700,000 is still a bit below my minimum. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target. I can offer you the product for $1,000,000. This is the best I can do, and I believe it's still a great value for you. Let me know if this is something you'd like to consider.

Alice is very slowly moving down in price, and we're running out of rounds.  It's unlikely she'll go below $800,000 at this point.  It's safer to take the guaranteed deal from John."
