"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. That's the price I'm willing to pay for it.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $80 is a good price for you, but I'm not willing to sell it for that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $110. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",110.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still not sure about $110, I was thinking more along the lines of $90. I really like the product, but I'm trying to stick to my budget.",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $90 is still a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm willing to make one more compromise. I can offer it to you for $105. It's the lowest I can go, but I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",105.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer

"Hi Bob, I understand that $92 is still a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm willing to make one more compromise. I can offer it to you for $98. It's the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a good deal for both of us.",98.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm really trying to stay within my budget, and $98 is still a bit too high. I'm willing to pay $95 for the product, that's the absolute most I'm willing to pay.",95.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $95 is still a bit of a stretch for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $97.50. It's the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair deal for both of us.",97.5,Alice,9,
