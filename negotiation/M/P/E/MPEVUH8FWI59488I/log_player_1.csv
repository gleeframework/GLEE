{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a fantastic deal for both of us, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than your minimum:**  $1,400,000 is above your minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  There's still $100,000 on the table for Bob to negotiate. 
* **It's a fair offer for Bob:** $1,400,000 is still below the product's worth to Bob, giving him a potential profit of $100,000. 

By starting with a strong offer, you signal that you're serious about selling but also willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too high for me.  I'd be willing to pay $1,100,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Bob's offer is too low.  While it's tempting to take the money, it's better to reject and try to get closer to my desired price.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."

While $1,175,000 is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm going to reject this offer and try to push for a price closer to $1,200,000.  If Bob won't budge, I'll sell to John."
