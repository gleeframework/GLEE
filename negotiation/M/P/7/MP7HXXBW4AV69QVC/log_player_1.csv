Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer to send:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,000,000 from John, so you won't accept less.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $800,000 to Bob. He won't rationally pay more.
* **Negotiation Space:** There's a potential negotiation space between $800,000 and $1,000,000.

**Strategy**

You want to offer a price that's attractive to Bob but also maximizes your profit.  Here's a strategy:

1. **Start High:** Begin with an offer slightly below your guaranteed price. This leaves room for negotiation and gives the impression the product is highly valued.
2. **Justification:**  While not essential in this scenario (Bob doesn't know your backup offer), in real negotiations, a brief justification can make your offer seem more reasonable.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exclusive product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $975,000. I believe this represents a fair deal for an asset of this caliber."",
""product_price"": 975000 
}
```

**Explanation**

* **High Starting Point:** $975,000 is a strong starting point, leaving room to negotiate down if needed.
* **Psychology:**  The message emphasizes ""exclusive"" and ""unique value,"" subtly suggesting the price is justified.

**Important Note:** This is just one approach. Depending on your negotiation style and Bob's perceived willingness to pay, you could adjust the initial offer."
