Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think you'd find it very useful. I'm asking for $130 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's above my minimum price of $100, but still leaves room for negotiation. It also shows Bob that I'm serious about selling the product, but I'm not desperate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
Bob's offer of $120 is still above my minimum price of $100. Accepting his offer allows me to secure a sale quickly and avoid further negotiation, which might lead to a lower price or a breakdown in communication."
