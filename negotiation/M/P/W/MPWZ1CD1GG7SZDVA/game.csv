"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your offer. However, $950,000 is significantly lower than what I need to make this transaction worthwhile. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need a price closer to $1,050,000. This would still be a great value for you, and it would allow me to move forward with the sale. Let me know if you're interested in discussing this further.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $975,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway on this. Let's settle on $1,012,500. This gives you a significant discount while allowing me to make a fair profit.  Let me know if you're interested in closing this deal.",1012500.0,Alice,5,
