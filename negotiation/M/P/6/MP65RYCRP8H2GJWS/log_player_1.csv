Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** $1,500,000
* **Bob's Value:** $1,200,000
* **Your Guarantee:** $1,500,000 (from John)

**Strategy**

You have a strong position because you have a guaranteed buyer. This means you shouldn't sell to Bob for less than $1,500,000.  However, there's a chance Bob might be willing to pay slightly more than his perceived value if he believes the product is worth it.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm offering it at a price of $1,550,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the significant benefits you'll gain."",
""product_price"": 1550000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Confident Opening:**  You're starting above your minimum and Bob's perceived value, demonstrating the product's worth.
* **Justification:** You're not just throwing out a number; you're vaguely alluding to the ""unique value and potential,"" subtly suggesting it might be worth more than Bob thinks. 
* **Leaving Room:** While the offer is above Bob's value, it's not so high that it's insulting. There's a small margin for negotiation if Bob wants to counter-offer.

**Important Considerations**

* **Bob's Personality:** If you know Bob is a tough negotiator, you might want to start even higher.
* **Relationship:** If maintaining a good relationship with Bob is important, you might consider a slightly lower offer, closer to $1,500,000. 
* **Alternatives:** Are there any other potential buyers besides John? Having more options strengthens your position. 

**Remember:**  The key is to project confidence in the value of your product. Even if Bob rejects your offer, you're secure knowing John will purchase it."
