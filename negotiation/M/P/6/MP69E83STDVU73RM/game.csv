"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me and the current market conditions. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget. What are your thoughts on this counteroffer?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your counteroffer. While $900,000 is below my minimum acceptable price, I'm willing to be flexible. I'm prepared to come down to $1,000,000. This price reflects the product's value and allows for a fair deal for both of us. I'm confident this price is reasonable considering the potential benefits you'll realize from this product. Let me know your thoughts on this counteroffer.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,000,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I can only go up to $950,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget constraints. What are your thoughts on this revised counteroffer?",950000.0,Bob,4,
