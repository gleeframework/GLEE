"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Explanation:**

Since your goal is to save as much money as possible, and you know you can buy the product from John for $100, it's not worth accepting Alice's offer of $120.  Rejecting allows you to try and negotiate a better price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 90} 
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $90. This is a significant discount from Alice's initial price, and it shows I'm serious about getting a good deal.  It's also a reasonable starting point, considering I can always buy from John for $100."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is still higher than what I can get from John.  I'll reject and continue negotiating to see if I can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 95}

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to my target, it's still slightly higher than what I can get from John.  I'll reject and continue negotiating to see if I can get her down to $100 or a little less."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100} 
```

**Explanation:**

I'm now offering Alice $100, the same price I can buy it from John for.  This puts the pressure on her to accept and hopefully close the deal.  If she rejects, I'm ready to walk away and buy from John."
