"I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to acquire a high-value product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start with a price of $900,000.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you starting the conversation. While I see the value in this product, $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm willing to offer $700,000 for it. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $700,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll make a counteroffer of $850,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product, and I'm confident you'll see the benefits of owning it.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $850,000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $800,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. I believe this reflects the value of the product while staying within my financial constraints.",800000.0,Bob,4,
