"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $12000 is a significant discount from my initial offer, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $16000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to me is $15000. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $16000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $14000.  This is a fair price, considering your profit margin, and my budget. Let me know what you think.",14000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $14000. I'm willing to make one more concession and sell the product to you for $15500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to me is $15000.
