Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer. While $1200000 is a good starting point, I'm not quite ready to let it go for that price.  How about we split the difference and settle on $1350000? It's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my asking price.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.
