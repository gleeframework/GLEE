Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone like you, and I'm confident you'll find it well worth the investment. I'm asking for $1,500,000.  Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, you can afford to start negotiations higher.  A starting point of $1,500,000 aims to maximize potential profit.
* **Open to negotiation:** The message implies a willingness to discuss the price further, allowing Bob to feel involved in the process and potentially reach a mutually agreeable deal above your minimum.
* **Value emphasis:** Highlighting the product's value to Bob specifically aims to justify the high price and pique his interest.

This strategy aims to balance ambition with flexibility, increasing the chances of exceeding your minimum sale price while keeping Bob engaged in the negotiation."
