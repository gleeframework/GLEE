"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a fair price considering the value it holds for you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's valuation but lower than my own minimum. This gives me room to negotiate while also signaling my commitment to a successful deal.  I'm aiming to get as close to my desired $1,000,000 as possible within the 10 rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your product's value, but I believe we can reach a more agreeable price. I am willing to pay $950,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum desired price of $1,000,000. I'm not desperate and have John as a backup, so I will reject the offer and try to get a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I value your interest, $950,000 is still a bit too low. Let's split the difference -  I'm willing to accept $1,050,000. This price is still below my ideal value but shows my desire to come to an agreement.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1050000}
``` 
 
I'm counteroffering with a price halfway between my previous offer and Bob's last one. This shows my willingness to compromise while still pushing for a price closer to my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. I'm willing to consider your latest offer of $1,050,000. However, I would like to propose a price of $1,000,000 to see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

Bob's offer is exactly my minimum desired price of $1,000,000. Accepting this offer ensures I meet my goal and get the best possible price without risking losing the deal."
