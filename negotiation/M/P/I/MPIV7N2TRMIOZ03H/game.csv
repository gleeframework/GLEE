"Alice, thanks for the offer! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm really interested in this product, but my budget for it is a bit lower than your initial price.  I'm willing to offer $1,100,000 for it.  I believe this is a fair price considering the value we both see in this product. What do you think?",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand that you're looking for a better price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,100,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,200,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a great value considering the product's worth to you.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
