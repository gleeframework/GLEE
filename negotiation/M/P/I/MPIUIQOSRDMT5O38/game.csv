"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I see the value in this product, $18,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'd be willing to pay $12,000 for it, which is my absolute maximum.  Let me know if that works for you.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer.  I understand your position, but $18,000 is closer to my initial expectation for this product. Could you meet me halfway at $15,000?",15000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I'm still interested in the product but $15,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm happy to compromise and offer $13,500.  This would be a fair price for both of us, as it's halfway between my previous offer and your current one.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",13500.0,Bob,4,
