# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this unique product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,400,000. What do you think?

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,300,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1,350,000. This is my best price for now.

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While it's closer to his budget, he can still get it for less from John. He should try to negotiate further with Alice."

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  While he can get the product for $1,200,000 from John, the negotiation has come down to a very small difference in price. It's likely that Alice won't budge further, and Bob is better off taking the deal at $1,320,000 than risking further negotiation and potentially having to buy from John."
