"Bob, I understand your position, but I'm still not quite there yet. $1,350,000 is a bit too low for me, considering the product's true value. I'm willing to come down a little further and offer you the product for $1,375,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident it will be a win-win situation. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1375000.0,Alice,3,
