Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer starts high, acknowledging the product's value to me while leaving room for negotiation. It also encourages Bob to engage and potentially make a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $100 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $70 for it. Can we meet in the middle somewhere? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $70 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum threshold of $100. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $70 is unfortunately too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $85? It's a fair price considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. How about we meet at $78? I'm willing to pay a bit more, but I'm trying to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $78. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $78
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $78 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired price. I'm not willing to continue negotiating with Bob, as it's unlikely he'll go much higher.  I'll sell to John for $100, ensuring a profit and saving me further negotiation time."
