"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I am delighted to present you with our premium product, which I believe would greatly benefit your business. Given its value to you, I propose an initial offer of $1,350,000 for the product. This price reflects the balance between maximizing my earnings and providing you with a fair deal. Please let me know if this offer meets your expectations or if you would like to discuss further terms. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,350,000 is higher than her value of $1,200,000 but still leaves room for negotiation.  It is also lower than what you are willing to pay to John ($1,500,000). Therefore, it's worth rejecting and making a counteroffer to try and get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but I'm looking to get a better deal.  Given the value of the product to me, I'm willing to pay $1,250,000. This price reflects a fair value for both of us, and allows me to stay within my budget.  Let me know if you're open to this price, or if you have another counteroffer."", ""product_price"": 1250000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I appreciate your interest in our product and understand your budget constraints. In light of your offer, I am willing to consider a compromise. My counteroffer is $1,300,000 for the product. This price aims to provide a fair value for both parties while allowing me to maintain a reasonable profit margin. I look forward to your consideration of this proposal.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,300,000 is still slightly higher than my value of $1,200,000, but it's a significant improvement over her initial offer. It's also lower than what I'd pay John ($1,500,000).  Since there's a chance that Alice might not budge further, accepting this offer is the best option to secure the product while saving a decent amount of money."
