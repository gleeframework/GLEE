"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I am interested in the product, $900,000 is a bit outside my budget. Would you be willing to come down to $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $700,000 is a bit of a stretch for you. However, I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm now offering the product to you for $850,000. Let me know if this is more in line with what you're looking for.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  To be honest, I have a hard limit at $750,000. If you can meet that, I'm ready to close the deal today.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $750,000 is your absolute limit, Bob. I'm willing to push the price a bit higher, but I'm not willing to go all the way down to $750,000. I'm now offering the product to you for $825,000. This is my final offer before considering other options.",825000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're close, but $825,000 is still a bit too high for me. I can do $775,000 and no higher. That's my absolute best offer. Let me know what you think.",775000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I can see that you're really interested in the product, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to make a serious offer. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $775,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $825,000 and $775,000, which would be $800,000. I'm confident that this is a fair price for the product, and I'm willing to sell it to you at this price. Let me know if this is acceptable to you.",800000.0,Alice,7,
