"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling this amazing product to you. I've done some research and understand that it's worth $15000 to you. However, I'm willing to make a compromise and offer it to you for $12000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I was thinking of making a counteroffer of $10000. I believe this price is more in line with the product's value to me, considering its worth $8000 to you. I'm willing to meet in the middle and pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget of $15000. What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $10000. Considering the product's worth $15000 to you, I'm willing to compromise further and offer it to you for $11500. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",11500.0,Alice,3,

I believe this is a fair price, taking into account the product's value to me and the value you place on it. What do you think?",9500.0,Bob,4,
