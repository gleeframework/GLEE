Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I list it publicly. Given its value and the demand I anticipate, I'm proposing a price of $19,000.  What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 19000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Potential Profit:** Since we have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, we should aim higher with Bob. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $19,000 allows room for Bob to negotiate down, potentially still landing a price higher than $15,000.
* **Justification:** The message hints at high value and demand, which might make Bob more amenable to the higher price. 

**Important Considerations:**

* This strategy assumes we have no time constraints. If we need to sell quickly, a lower offer to Bob might be more strategic.
* Bob's personality and negotiation style are unknown.  Adjusting the offer based on those factors could be beneficial."
