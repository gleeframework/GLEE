Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,800,000 is still a bit out of my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $1,500,000? This price reflects the product's value to me while also allowing you to make a profit.  I believe this is a fair compromise and a good starting point for a mutually beneficial agreement.
