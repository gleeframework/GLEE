"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a great product that I think you'll really like. I'm willing to sell it to you for $120. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $120 is a good price, you can potentially do better. You're willing to pay up to $150, so there's room to negotiate.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  $120 is a bit high for me.  How about $105?  I'm really interested in the product, and I think this price is fair for both of us."", ""product_price"": 105} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $120 was a bit steep, but I was thinking more along the lines of $115. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit on this sale. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $115, which is closer to my ideal price of $105.  Since I'm willing to pay up to $150, this is still a good deal for me. Accepting her offer saves me $35 compared to buying from John."
