Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $15,000.  Let me know if you're interested, and we can discuss further."",
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a higher profit. 
* **Justification:** The message subtly implies the product's value to justify the higher price without explicitly revealing your minimum.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The phrase ""and we can discuss further"" signals to Bob that you're open to negotiation, making him more likely to engage. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Perspective:** While you know Bob values the product at $12,000, he doesn't know that you have a guaranteed buyer at that price. This gives you some leverage.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  There's a risk that Bob will reject the offer outright. However, the potential reward of securing a higher price outweighs the risk of losing out on the $12,000 from John."
