Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product. I believe it would be incredibly beneficial for you, and I'm confident it's worth a significant investment. Given its value, I propose a price of $925,000. This is a fair offer considering the potential return on investment you'll gain."",
""product_price"": 925000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we know Bob values the product at $1,000,000, we want to secure the highest possible price. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting high allows for potential negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, and we can always come down slightly while still staying above our minimum.
* **Strategic Positioning:** Offering a price closer to Bob's perceived value increases the chances of him accepting, as the perceived gain for him is still substantial. 

By starting at $925,000, we aim for a sweet spot that entices Bob to accept while maximizing our potential profit."
