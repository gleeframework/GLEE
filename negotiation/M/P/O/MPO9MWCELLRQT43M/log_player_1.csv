While Bob's offer is higher than John's, it's still significantly lower than my desired price.  I'm going to counteroffer and try to push for a higher price."

I'm lowering my offer again, but I'm still holding out for a price closer to my valuation.  I believe this offer remains attractive to Bob, but also puts more pressure on him to accept.  If he rejects this offer, I'm starting to get closer to the point where I might consider selling to John."

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to John's offer, I'm still not ready to give up on getting a higher price from Bob. I'll counteroffer one more time, and then I'll seriously consider selling to John if Bob continues to reject my offers."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

I've reached the point where I need to make a decision. Bob's offer is now the same as John's offer.  While I would prefer to get a higher price, I don't want to risk losing a sale completely. It's time to sell to John and secure the $800,000."
