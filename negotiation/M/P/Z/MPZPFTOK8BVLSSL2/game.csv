"Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think would be a great fit for you. It's worth at least $10,000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,500.  What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $9,500 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you're interested but $7,000 is far too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but $8,500 is my absolute minimum.  Let's try to find a middle ground.",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand that you're looking for a fair price. How about we settle at $7,750? That's a reasonable compromise.",7750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I'm happy to keep negotiating, but $7,750 is still too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $8,125?  This is a fair price considering the value of the product and my willingness to negotiate.",8125.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer. I appreciate your willingness to work towards a deal. How about $7,900?",7900.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're very close to a deal.  I'm going to make one final offer of $8,000. This is a significant compromise on my part, and I really hope you'll accept. If we can't agree, I'll have to move on to other options.",8000.0,Alice,7,
