"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product. It's a unique and valuable item that I'm confident you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $2000000. This is a fair price considering its worth to me, and I believe it's a great value for you as well.",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer but $2000000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay at this time. I'm very interested in this product, but given my budget, I can only offer $1000000.  What do you think?",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $1000000. I appreciate your interest in the product, and I'm willing to consider a counteroffer. After careful thought, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1400000. This is a fair compromise, considering the value I place on the product. What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1400000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm happy to meet you closer to the middle, and offer $1200000. This is the absolute maximum I can pay, given my budget. Let me know what you think.",1200000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your revised offer of $1200000. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for that price. Considering the value I place on the product, I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $1300000. This is as low as I'm willing to go. What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,5,
