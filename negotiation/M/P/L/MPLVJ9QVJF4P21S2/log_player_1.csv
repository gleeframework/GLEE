"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 140}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $140. This is a good starting point, as it's below Bob's perceived value but still above my minimum acceptable price. I'm hoping to secure a good deal while leaving room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $130 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get a better price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 135}
```

I'm counteroffering at $135. This is a compromise, showing willingness to negotiate while still trying to get a price closer to my initial offer."
