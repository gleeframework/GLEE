"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be of significant value to you. It's worth at least $1,000,000 to me, and I know it would be equally valuable to you. I'm offering it to you for $1,000,000. This is a one-time opportunity, and I'm confident you won't regret it. Let me know your decision. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is offering the product at her minimum price, which is the same price John is willing to sell it for.  Since Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible, rejecting Alice's offer makes sense. Bob can then buy the product from John at the same price, achieving his goal."
