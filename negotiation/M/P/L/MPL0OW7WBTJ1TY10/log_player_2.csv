Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Since my goal is to save as much money as possible, I'm starting with my maximum budget of $100.  This is a significant discount from Alice's initial offer, and it demonstrates my seriousness in wanting to buy the product while staying within my financial limits."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to my budget, it's still above my maximum $100 limit. I believe I can still negotiate a lower price and will try to counteroffer in the next round."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}

I'm increasing my offer slightly from $100 to $120. This shows Alice I'm willing to compromise, but still firmly within my acceptable price range.  It also gives us some room to meet in the middle for a mutually agreeable price."
