"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the discount, but I'm looking to pay closer to $800,000. This product is valuable to me, but I need to be sure I'm getting a good deal. What do you think?",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your honesty about your budget. However, I'm still a bit above your target. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $950,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $950,000 is a better price, I'm still hoping to close this deal closer to $900,000. This would allow me to move forward with the purchase and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product to me. Let's see if we can bridge the gap.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your desire to get closer to your target price, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $900,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $925,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.
