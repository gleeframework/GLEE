"Hi Alice, $15000 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in the product but I'm only able to offer $8000 at this time. Let me know what you think.",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit to $12000. This reflects the value of the product and gives you a good deal. Let's meet in the middle!",12000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $12000 is still higher than my budget. I'm willing to go up to $9500. This shows my serious interest, and I hope it's a starting point for us to find a solution.",9500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I see your commitment to this product, but I can't go lower than $10000. This is my absolute minimum.  It's a fair price considering the product's value, and it gives us both a good deal. Let me know if you're willing to meet me there.",10000.0,Alice,5,
