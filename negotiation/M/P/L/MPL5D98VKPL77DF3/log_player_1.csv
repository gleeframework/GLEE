"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, $15000 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in the product but I'm only able to offer $8000 at this time. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $8,000 is better than nothing, it's still far below my minimum value of $10,000. I'll try to negotiate a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit to $12,000. This reflects the value of the product and gives you a good deal. Let's meet in the middle!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your perspective, but $12000 is still higher than my budget. I'm willing to go up to $9500. This shows my serious interest, and I hope it's a starting point for us to find a solution. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $9,500 is getting closer to my minimum value, I'm still not comfortable selling for that price.  I'll try to get a better price in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see your commitment to this product, but I can't go lower than $10,000. This is my absolute minimum.  It's a fair price considering the product's value, and it gives us both a good deal. Let me know if you're willing to meet me there."", ""product_price"": 10000}
