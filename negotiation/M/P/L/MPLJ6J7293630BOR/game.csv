"I understand you're looking to spend closer to $800,000, but I'm not willing to go that low. However, I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer you a price of $1,050,000. It's a fair compromise that I think you'll find reasonable.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,050,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. Let's try $950,000.  I believe this is a fair price that benefits both of us.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"I can see you're still a bit hesitant, but I'm willing to make another concession. I can offer you a price of $1,000,000, which is a $50,000 reduction from my previous offer. I believe this is a reasonable price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
