"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I believe this product is incredibly valuable and will be a game-changer for you. I'm offering it to you for $1,500,000. This is a limited-time offer, so I encourage you to consider it carefully."",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm aiming high initially to test Bob's willingness to pay a premium. This leaves room for negotiation while still staying significantly above my minimum acceptable price.
* **Creating Urgency:** By mentioning a ""limited-time offer,"" I'm subtly introducing a sense of urgency, encouraging Bob to act sooner rather than later. 
* **Justification:** While brief, I'm highlighting the product's value to Bob to justify the high asking price. 

This strategy allows me to gauge Bob's interest and adjust my approach in subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice, but I'm not willing to pay $1,500,000. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the market value of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is a significant amount, I'm not ready to settle just yet. I started high for a reason, and I believe there's still room for negotiation. Selling to John for $1,000,000 is my absolute fallback option, so I'm willing to see if I can secure a better deal with Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective on the price.  However, the value this product brings to your specific business needs is significant. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000, which I believe is a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Concession with Justification:** I'm making a significant concession by dropping $150,000, but I'm also reiterating the product's unique value to Bob's business. 
* **Meeting in the Middle:** This counteroffer aims to find a middle ground between my initial asking price and Bob's offer.
* **Maintaining Value:** I'm still aiming for a price significantly higher than my minimum while showing a willingness to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product. I think this is a more reasonable price considering the market value and the value it brings to my business. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has now increased his offer twice, signaling serious interest. While $1,250,000 isn't my ideal price, it's a strong return and significantly above my minimum. Continuing to negotiate aggressively risks pushing Bob away and potentially losing the deal altogether. It's better to secure a very good offer now than risk ending up with John's $1,000,000."
