Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}

I'm starting high, at $2,000,000. This gives me room to negotiate if Bob counters. I believe the product is worth more than this to me, so I'm confident I can earn a good profit. If Bob rejects, I'll evaluate his counteroffer and decide if it's worth continuing the negotiation or moving on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,500,000 is my minimum, I believe I can do better. Bob's initial offer shows he's interested, so I'll try to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

I'm lowering my price to $1,750,000. This is a significant concession from my initial offer, but it still leaves some room for profit. I believe Bob is willing to pay more than $1,500,000, but I'm not willing to go lower than $1,750,000 at this point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob has come up to $1,600,000 which is closer to my ideal price.  I'm going to accept his offer. I'm not sure if I can get a better price, and this is worth more than selling to John right now."
