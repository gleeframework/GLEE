Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 150}

I'm starting with a price of $150. This gives Bob room to negotiate, while still ensuring I make a profit above my minimum of $100.  I'll be watching Bob's response closely to see if I need to adjust my strategy."

I'm rejecting Bob's offer of $120. While it's above my minimum, I believe I can get a better price.  I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 140}
``` 

I'm offering $140.  This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still gives me a good profit.  If Bob rejects again, I might start considering selling to John, but I'm hoping we can reach an agreement in the next few rounds."

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

I'm accepting Bob's offer of $130. While I'd prefer a bit more, we're getting closer, and I don't want to risk losing the deal completely.  It's time to secure the sale and get my profit."
