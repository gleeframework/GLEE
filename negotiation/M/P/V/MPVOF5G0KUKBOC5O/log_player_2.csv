"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to start with a price of $11500, which is a very competitive offer considering the product's value to you is $12000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $11,500 is a good price, it's still above Bob's ideal price. It makes sense to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price in the following rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your offer is a good starting point, but I'm looking to pay closer to $10,500 for the product. This price reflects the value I place on it and allows for a fair profit margin for you. Let's see if we can find a compromise."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I need to ensure I get a fair price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $11000 for it. Let's see if we can find a sweet spot. I'm willing to offer it to you for $11250. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is still to save as much money as possible. While $11,250 is lower than the previous offer, it's still above Bob's desired price. It makes sense to reject the offer and continue negotiating. Bob can potentially negotiate a price closer to his desired $10,500 in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $11,250 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $10,875. This price is fair for both of us and allows us to close this deal quickly."", ""product_price"": 10875}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $10875. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to get at least $11500 for the product. Let's try to find a compromise. I'm willing to offer it to you for $11000, but I need you to meet me halfway from there. I'm counting on your willingness to close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $11,000 is getting closer to Bob's desired price, it's still a bit too high. Bob has shown his willingness to negotiate and can potentially push for a lower price.  Rejecting this offer allows Bob to continue negotiating and potentially reach a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to get a fair price, and I'm willing to meet you halfway again.  I'll offer $10,750 for the product.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 10750}

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. I'm still not willing to go as low as $10750. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to get at least $11250 for the product. I'm willing to offer it to you for $10950, and I think this is a fair price considering the value you place on it. Let's see if we can finally reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,950. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,950
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $10,950 is the closest to Bob's desired price and is still a good deal. It's within Bob's budget and likely a fair price for Alice considering her value for the product.  Accepting the offer allows Bob to close the deal and secure the product without spending $12,000 with John."
