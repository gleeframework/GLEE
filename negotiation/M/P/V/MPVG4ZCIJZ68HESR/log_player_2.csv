``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is better for Bob:**  Alice is offering the product for $9,500, which is less than Bob's maximum budget of $10,000. 
* **Rejecting Alice's offer is worse:**  If Bob rejects Alice's offer, he'll have to buy from John for $10,000, which is more expensive.

Therefore, accepting Alice's offer is the best choice to save money."
