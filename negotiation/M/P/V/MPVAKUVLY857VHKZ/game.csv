"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but the price is a bit high for me.  Could we work something closer to $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $600,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $900,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the value I place on it.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $900,000 is getting closer, but it's still a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $700,000? I think that's a fair compromise.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $850,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",850000.0,Alice,5,
