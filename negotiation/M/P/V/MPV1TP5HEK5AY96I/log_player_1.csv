"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,150,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's still below what it's worth to me and a significant saving for you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to save even more. I'm willing to pay $1100000 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired value. I'm willing to negotiate further to see if I can get a better price. There are still 8 rounds left, and I believe I can secure a better deal by continuing the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,125,000. This is a fair price that allows you to get a great deal while also ensuring I get a reasonable return on my investment. Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1125000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but I'm still looking to save some more. I'm willing to pay $1090000 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,090,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,090,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is now lower than my minimum acceptable value of $1,200,000.  There are only 6 rounds left, and it seems unlikely Bob will meet my price. Selling to John ensures I get my desired amount, even though it means forgoing further negotiation with Bob."
