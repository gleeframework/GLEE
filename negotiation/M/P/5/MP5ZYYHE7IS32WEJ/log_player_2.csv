**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer:** $1,400,000
* **Your maximum willingness to pay:** $1,500,000
* **John's offer:** $1,500,000

Since John is willing to sell the product for the same price as your maximum willingness to pay, there is no benefit to accepting Alice's offer. Rejecting her offer allows you to purchase the product from John for the same price, which is your maximum value."
