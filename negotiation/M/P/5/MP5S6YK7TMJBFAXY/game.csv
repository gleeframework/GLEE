"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. Given its unique value, I'm initially proposing a price of $20,000. I'm confident you'll recognize its worth, but I'm open to discussing what makes sense for both of us.",20000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $20,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $12,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest and counteroffer.  While I appreciate your perspective, the product's value is significantly higher than that to me. I could consider letting it go for $17,000.  This feels like a fair compromise to ensure you're getting a good deal on something truly valuable.",17000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that the product has value, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $13,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers, but I think this is the maximum I can go.",13500.0,Bob,4,
