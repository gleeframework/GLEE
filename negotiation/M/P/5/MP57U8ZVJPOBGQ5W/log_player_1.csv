Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you might be interested in. I'm asking for $115 for it. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 115
}
``` 

I'm starting the negotiation at a price slightly lower than Bob's perceived value ($120) to leave room for bargaining while still aiming for a price significantly higher than my minimum ($100)."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $115 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $105? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $105 is above my minimum, I believe I can still negotiate a better price with Bob.  I'm willing to push a little further before accepting an offer below $110."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand your position, Bob. How about we meet in the middle at $110?"", 
""product_price"": 110
}
``` 

I'm proposing a price closer to the middle ground between our initial offers. This shows a willingness to compromise while still aiming for a price that benefits me significantly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  How about $107? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $107. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $107
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob is clearly trying to get the best possible deal, and while I could push for a little more, accepting $107 is a good outcome. It's significantly above my minimum and avoids the risk of Bob walking away if I push too hard."
