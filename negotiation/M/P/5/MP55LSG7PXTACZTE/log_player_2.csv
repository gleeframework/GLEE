"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I'm proposing a price of $925,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering the significant return you stand to gain. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, you can still do better.  You are willing to pay up to $1,000,000, and Alice is willing to sell for $800,000. This means there is room for negotiation. By rejecting her offer, you can potentially get a lower price."
