"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's an exceptional opportunity that could significantly benefit your business. Considering its value, I propose a price of $900,000 for this exclusive item. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I recognize the value of your product, I believe a price of $600,000 would be more reasonable. Let me know what you think."",
""product_price"": 600000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  By starting significantly lower than Alice's asking price, we establish a negotiation space and signal our intent to bargain. 
* **Strategic Number:** $600,000 is a substantial offer that might be tempting to Alice while still leaving room for us to increase our bid if needed.
* **Polite and Professional:** Maintaining a courteous tone is essential for a successful negotiation, even when presenting a counteroffer that's significantly different."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I appreciate your perspective. After careful consideration, I am willing to negotiate further. I propose a price of $750,000 for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the movement on price. I'm getting closer to a point where I can make this work. How about we settle at $675,000?"",
""product_price"": 675000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Increase:** We are increasing our offer, but by a smaller amount than Alice's decrease. This shows we're negotiating but still aiming for a significant discount.
* **Middle Ground:** $675,000 is a midpoint between our previous offer and her current one, potentially finding a compromise.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  By suggesting we are ""getting closer"" to a deal, we subtly introduce a sense of time sensitivity without being overly aggressive."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your position, Bob. In light of our previous discussions, I am prepared to offer the product at $725,000. This represents a fair compromise considering the value you place on it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $725,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. To be completely transparent, my budget ceiling is $700,000. If you're able to meet that, I'm ready to close the deal today."",
""product_price"": 700000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:** We are setting a clear limit to avoid prolonged back-and-forth. This shows we're serious but still willing to negotiate.
* **Transparency Builds Trust:** By being open about our budget, we might encourage Alice to be more flexible, knowing we're reaching our maximum.
* **Sense of Urgency (Again):** Mentioning ""closing the deal today"" subtly reinforces the time constraint, potentially leading to a quicker resolution."
