"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $140 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $115.  This is my final offer, as I can get the product for $120 elsewhere. Let me know what you think.",115.0,Bob,4,

"I can see you're a serious buyer, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $125, but that's as low as I can go. It's still a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll love the product.",125.0,Alice,5,
