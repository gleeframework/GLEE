Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting with an offer of $15,000. This is a reasonable starting point, giving Bob some room to negotiate while still ensuring I profit significantly above my minimum value.  If Bob rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my desired price, and I'm not willing to settle for such a low amount.  I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round, trying to find a more reasonable compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $13,000. This is still above my minimum value of $12,000 but closer to Bob's offer, showing my willingness to negotiate. I'm hoping this will be more appealing to Bob, but I'm prepared to continue negotiating if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum value, I'm still not satisfied with the price. I'm going to reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round. It's worth trying to push for a slightly higher price, as I'm confident I can secure at least $12,000 from John if this negotiation fails."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500}
```

I'm counteroffering at $12,500. This is a compromise, as it's only $500 higher than Bob's offer and $500 lower than my previous offer.  I'm hoping this shows my willingness to meet halfway and encourages Bob to accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is finally at my minimum value. While I'd love to earn more, it's not worth risking the sale and ending up with nothing.  Accepting Bob's offer ensures I get at least my desired amount, which is the most important factor."
