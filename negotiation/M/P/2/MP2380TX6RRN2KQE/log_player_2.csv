"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,500. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident it's worth that much to you. If you're not interested, I'll be selling it to John for $12,000. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's product might be worth $12,000 to Bob, her offer of $12,500 exceeds his budget. It's more advantageous for him to reject Alice's offer and buy the product from John for $12,000, saving himself $500."
