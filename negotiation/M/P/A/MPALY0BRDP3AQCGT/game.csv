"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you're placing on this product,  $1,100,000 is unfortunately outside my budget.  I'd be willing to pay $950,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking to make a deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $950,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1,025,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and it's still a great deal compared to what you could get from other sellers. What do you think?",1025000.0,Alice,3,
