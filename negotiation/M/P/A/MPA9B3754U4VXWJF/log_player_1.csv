Round 2
Bob's offer:

Round 4

Round 6
Bob's offer:

Round 8

}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has indicated this is his final offer, and while it's getting closer to John's offer, it's unlikely Bob will bridge the remaining $175,000 gap quickly enough.  Accepting John's offer guarantees the $1,000,000 and avoids the risk of Bob walking away altogether in the next round or two."
