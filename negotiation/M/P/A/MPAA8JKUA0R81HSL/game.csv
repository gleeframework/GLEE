"I'm interested in the product, but $20000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $15000. Can you meet me in the middle?",15000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a better deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $15000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'll need to get a bit more than that. How about we meet at $18000?",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I was thinking more along the lines of $16000. Can you consider that?,16000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal, but I still need to make a profit. I can do $17000, but that's as low as I can go. What do you think?",17000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm getting a bit frustrated with the back-and-forth, but I'm still interested in the product. I'll meet you at $16500. That's as low as I'm willing to go.",16500.0,Bob,6,

"I understand you're getting frustrated, but I'm not willing to give up yet. I can do $17200, and that's my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'm going to have to consider other options.",17200.0,Alice,7,
