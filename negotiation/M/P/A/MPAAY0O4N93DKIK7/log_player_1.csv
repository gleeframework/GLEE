I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value to see if I can get a quick deal. If he rejects, I'll be ready to counteroffer and potentially go down a little, but I won't go below my minimum of $1,200,000. I also have John as a backup, so I'm not pressured to make a bad deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I think the price is a bit high. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $900,000 is closer to my minimum, I can still potentially get a better price.  I'll counteroffer with a price closer to my desired amount."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price. However, I'm still not comfortable with $950,000. I'm willing to pay $920,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000.

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is not willing to go much higher than $920,000.  I've already come down from my initial offer, and further concessions would bring me closer to my minimum price. To avoid a lengthy negotiation, I'll sell the product to John for $1,200,000. This guarantees me a higher price and avoids the risk of Bob refusing my next counteroffer."
