{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $12,000 is a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8500 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10000, which is still a great deal for you. Let's find a middle ground.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, $10,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm really keen on this product, but I'm only able to go up to $9,000. Let's see if we can find a compromise."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9000 is still a little low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $9500. This is a fair price considering the product's value, and it gives us both a good outcome. Let's close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

You should choose to buy from John. While Alice's offer is getting closer to your desired price, it's still above your maximum budget of $8,000. John is offering the product for your exact budget, so there's no reason to continue negotiating with Alice."
