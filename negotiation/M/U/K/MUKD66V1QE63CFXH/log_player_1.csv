Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 115}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than Bob's perceived value:** $115 is more than what Bob is willing to pay, so he'll likely counteroffer.
* **It's lower than your minimum:**  $115 is still above your minimum of $120, giving you some room to negotiate.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between getting the best price possible while also keeping the negotiation open."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low. While it's tempting to take the $105, it's better to hold out for a better price. John is willing to pay $120, so there's no reason to settle for less. 

Rejecting Bob's offer keeps the negotiation open and gives you the opportunity to make a counteroffer that's closer to your desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

This counteroffer is a compromise:

* **Higher than Bob's offer:** $110 is more than Bob's offer of $105, showing you're willing to negotiate.
* **Lower than your initial offer:**  $110 is less than your initial $115, showing flexibility.
* **Still above your minimum:** $110 is still higher than your minimum of $120, ensuring you don't lose out.

This counteroffer is a good balance between getting a better price and keeping the negotiation moving towards a potential agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $108
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer of $108 is still below my minimum of $120. While it's tempting to keep negotiating, John is willing to pay my minimum price. 

It's more efficient and less risky to sell to John, ensuring a guaranteed profit and a faster transaction."
