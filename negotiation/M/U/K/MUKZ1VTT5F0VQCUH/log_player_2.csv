# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $850,000 is a significant reduction, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you and my original asking price. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.
