"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

I'm starting high, aiming for a profit. Bob knows the product's worth to him, so he'll likely counter. I'll then adjust my price based on his response and the remaining rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,001. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,001
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is insultingly low.  He's clearly trying to lowball me. I'll counter with a more reasonable price and see if we can find common ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly, but still aiming for a decent profit. This shows Bob I'm serious about selling, but also that I'm not willing to go for his ridiculously low offer.  I'll see how he reacts to this more reasonable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, and we're already halfway through the rounds.  While I'd prefer more, it's a reasonable profit. It's not worth risking further negotiation for a higher price, especially with the risk of John becoming a more attractive option."
