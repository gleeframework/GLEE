"I'm really interested in the product, but $12000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $9000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $10500?  That would still be a great deal for you, and it gets me closer to where I need to be.",10500.0,Alice,3,
