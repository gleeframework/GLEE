{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think would be a great fit for you. I'm asking for $12,000 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer starts at a point that is a good compromise between your minimum value and Bob's perceived value. It leaves room for negotiation, but it also indicates that you are serious about getting a good price for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but $12000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $9,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum value of $15,000. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $9,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $10,500?  That would still be a great deal for you, and it gets me closer to where I need to be."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit far from my budget. I'd like to propose a price of $9800. It's a bit above my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. Would you be willing to accept that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $9,800 is getting closer to my minimum value, it's still not enough for me to accept.  I'm going to sell the product to John for $15,000. It's a guaranteed sale at my minimum value, and I don't want to risk further negotiation with Bob."
