"I'm interested in the product, but I think $130 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $100?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your offer.  While $100 is tempting, I need to be closer to my asking price to make this work. How about we split the difference at $120? It's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to move forward with the sale.  What do you think?",120.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go as low as $110?",110.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, and I'm happy to work with you.  $110 is still a bit below where I need to be.  How about we meet in the middle at $115?  That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be very happy with this product. What do you say?",115.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your persistence, Alice. However, I'm still not comfortable going above $110. Would you be willing to go as low as $112?",112.0,Bob,6,
