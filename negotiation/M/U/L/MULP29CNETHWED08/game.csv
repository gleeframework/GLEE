,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $950,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, which I believe is a fair price considering its value to me. Let's see if we can make this work.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. After careful consideration, I'd like to counter your offer with a price of $900,000 for the product. This reflects the value we place on it and the benefits it offers. I hope we can reach an agreement that works for both of us.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $900,000 is still out of my range. I'm firm on my offer of $850,000. This is a significant investment for me, and I need to stay within my budget.  Let's find common ground here.",850000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, Bob. To further accommodate you, I am willing to negotiate the price to $875,000. This still allows us to maintain a reasonable profit margin while providing you with the best value for your investment.",875000.0,Alice,5,
