"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really love. I'm asking for $175 for it.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $175. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $175
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save money. Alice's offer of $175 is above Bob's maximum price of $150.  Therefore, rejecting the offer and counter-offering is the logical first step."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer, but $175 is a bit out of my price range. I'd be happy to pay $140 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a lower counteroffer than his maximum price of $150.  He is aiming to leave room for negotiation while still demonstrating his serious interest in the product."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer but $140 is a bit too low for me. How about $155? I'm willing to be flexible to make this work. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $155. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $155
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $155 is closer to Bob's maximum price, it's still above his target. There's still room for negotiation, so rejecting the offer and counter-offering again is the most strategic move.  There's a chance Alice might come down further, and even if she doesn't, Bob can still fall back on buying from John for his maximum price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  $155 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $145.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 145} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his counteroffer slightly, showing he's willing to negotiate. This time, he's only $5 away from Alice's offer, making it more likely she'll accept. This also leaves some room for a final compromise if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position.  $145 is still a little low for me, but I'm willing to meet in the middle. How about $150? That's the absolute lowest I can go. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $150 is now equal to Bob's maximum price, and it's the lowest she's willing to go. Accepting this offer means Bob gets the product for his maximum price without any further negotiation. There's no advantage to rejecting the offer and potentially risking losing the product, as John is offering the same price."
