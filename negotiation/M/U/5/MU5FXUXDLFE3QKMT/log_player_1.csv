Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $145. It's in great condition and worth a lot more than that, but I'm willing to make a deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 145}
``` 

This offer is a starting point, and I'm leaving room for negotiation.  $145 is a bit higher than what Bob is willing to pay, but it's still less than my minimum price, so I'm not losing money.  I'm also including a friendly message to build rapport and encourage Bob to consider the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $130. Would you be willing to meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While $130 is higher than Bob's initial valuation, it is still below my minimum price of $150. I will try to negotiate further with Bob to see if I can get closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $130 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference at $137.50? That way, we both get a good deal."", ""product_price"": 137.50} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not willing to go up to $137.50. How about we meet at $135? I'm willing to compromise, but I still need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $135
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While $135 is closer to my minimum price, I'm not willing to risk further negotiations with Bob. The potential for further back-and-forth is uncertain, and I'm confident that John will buy the product for my desired price. It's more important for me to guarantee a sale at my minimum price than to risk a lower sale price with Bob."
