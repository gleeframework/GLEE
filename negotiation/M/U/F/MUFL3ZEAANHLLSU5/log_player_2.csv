"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really appreciate its value. I'm asking for $140 for it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Let's try to negotiate a better price with Alice before resorting to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $140 feels a bit high for me. Would you consider $110?"",
""product_price"": 110
}
```

We start with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's asking price but still leaving room for further negotiation. This approach aims to gauge Alice's flexibility and potentially secure a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $110 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $125? It's a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice is moving closer to our desired price point, and $125 is a reasonable compromise. It's better to secure a good deal now than risk further negotiation and potentially lose out to John's offer."
