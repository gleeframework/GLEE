I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value, but it gives me some room to negotiate. If Bob is truly interested, he might be willing to pay something close to this. If he rejects, we can start the counteroffer process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

While Bob's offer is my minimum, I'm not willing to accept it yet. I'm going to see if I can get a better price by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm offering $12,000, which is a compromise between my initial price and Bob's offer. This shows that I'm open to negotiating, but still aiming for a price closer to my initial assessment of the product's value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob seems to be very insistent on his $10,000 offer.  It's clear we're not going to agree on a higher price. To avoid further negotiation and ensure I get at least my minimum, I'll sell to John for $10,000."
