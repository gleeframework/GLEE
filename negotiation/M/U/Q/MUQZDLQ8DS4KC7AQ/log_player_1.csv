Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1500000} 

This is a starting point. I'm aiming high, knowing the product is worth at least $1,000,000 to me. I'll assess Bob's response and adjust my strategy based on his counteroffer (if any) and the risk of losing him as a buyer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Bob's offer is closer to my desired price, but I'm still not satisfied. I believe I can potentially get more, especially if I can make him believe I have other options. I'll counter-offer and see where it leads."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1350000} 

I'm lowering my price slightly, but still keeping it above Bob's offer. This shows flexibility while maintaining a good price point. I'm hoping this counteroffer will be attractive enough for Bob to accept, but I'm also prepared to negotiate further if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is now the same as his previous offer, which means he's unlikely to budge further. While I would prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, the risk of going through another round of negotiation and potentially ending up with nothing is too high. Accepting his offer guarantees me $1,200,000, which is significantly better than selling to John for $1,000,000."
