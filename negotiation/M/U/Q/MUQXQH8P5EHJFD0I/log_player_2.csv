"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,200,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible.  $1,200,000 is still too high, and he can likely get a better price by negotiating with Alice.  He has 10 rounds, so there's time to negotiate.  Buying from John right now would be the worst financial outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000. Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1,050,000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm counteroffering at $1,225,000. I believe this price reflects the value of the product and I'm confident you'll find it a fair deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,225,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,225,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice has moved closer to Bob's desired price, $1,225,000 is still higher than his ideal.  There is still room for negotiation, and Bob is not desperate to close the deal immediately.  He can continue negotiating and see if he can get Alice to come down further.  Buying from John at this point would be a worse financial outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,225,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. Let's try $1,100,000. This offer reflects the value of the product for me, and I believe it's a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $1,100,000 is still a bit lower than my target, but I'm willing to meet you closer to your price. I'm counteroffering at $1,175,000. I believe this price is a fair compromise and reflects the value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,175,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,175,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's ideal price, it's still above his target.  Bob is willing to continue negotiating and potentially reach a price closer to his desired $1,100,000. Buying from John at this point is still a worse financial outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, we're getting closer.  I'm willing to go up to $1,150,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and it's the best I can do.  Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $1,150,000, Bob. However, I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target price. I'm counteroffering at $1,200,000, which is the lowest I'm willing to go. This is a fair price for the value the product brings, and I believe it's a reasonable compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is still above Bob's ideal price, and they are getting close to the end of the negotiation rounds.  While it's possible to continue negotiating, Bob risks running out of time and having to accept a price closer to Alice's minimum.  At this point, buying from John for $1,500,000 is a better financial outcome than risking a deal that might not get to a satisfactory price."
