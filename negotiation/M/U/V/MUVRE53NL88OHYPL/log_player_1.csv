Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. It's a valuable piece, and I believe this price reflects its worth. I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's slightly higher than the product's value to Bob, but still leaves room for negotiation. I'm also framing the offer as a potential for a mutually beneficial agreement, setting a positive tone for the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your confidence in the product's worth, but I'm a bit concerned about the price. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to be more comfortable with the cost. I'm thinking of offering $750,000 for the product. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. I'm not willing to sell for less than $800,000, and I believe there's still room for negotiation to reach a mutually agreeable price. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $750,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to compromise, however. Let's meet at $850,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us both to benefit from this deal."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $850,000 is still a bit above my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $750,000 and $850,000, which would be $800,000. I'm confident that this is a fair price for both of us. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, and I'm happy to close the deal with him. There's no need to continue negotiating, as I've reached my goal."
