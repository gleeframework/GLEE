Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1750000} 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's value:**  $1,750,000 is more than what the product is worth to Bob, giving him incentive to negotiate.
* **It's below your minimum:** This price leaves room for negotiation while still ensuring you get a better price than selling to John.

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is far too low. While it's tempting to take the quick cash, it's significantly below my minimum value of $1,500,000.  I will reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

I'm offering $1,250,000, which is still above Bob's value but significantly lower than my initial offer.  This shows I'm willing to compromise while also making sure I get a decent return on my investment."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer of $900,000 is a slight improvement, it's still far below my minimum value of $1,500,000. I'm going to reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

I'm offering $1,100,000.  This is a further compromise, but it still leaves a decent margin for profit.  I'm hoping this offer is attractive enough for Bob to consider seriously."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is still too low. While I am willing to negotiate, I'm not willing to go below my minimum value of $1,500,000. It's time to cut my losses and sell to John for a guaranteed profit."
