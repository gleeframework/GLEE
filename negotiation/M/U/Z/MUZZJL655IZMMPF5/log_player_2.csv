The offer from Alice is way over your budget.  It makes sense to reject and make a counter offer."

While Alice's offer is closer to your budget, it's still too high.  You should try to negotiate further."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

This counteroffer is a compromise, halfway between your maximum and Alice's last offer. This shows you're serious about buying but still trying to save money."

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000

This is a slightly higher counteroffer than your previous one, showing you are willing to move, but still firmly within your budget. It also leaves room for potential compromise if Alice counters again."
