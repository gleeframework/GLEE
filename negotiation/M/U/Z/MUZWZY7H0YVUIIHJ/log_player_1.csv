Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you might be interested in. I'm asking for $170 for it. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 170}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's valuation isn't helpful in this scenario.**  You have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $150. Any information about Bob's willingness to pay is irrelevant unless you can get him to pay more than John.
* **Starting high anchors the negotiation.** While Bob's perceived value is $80, starting with a higher price leaves room for negotiation. It also might make him think the product is more valuable than he initially thought.
* **You can always go down, but you can't go up.** If Bob rejects the initial offer, you can always lower the price closer to $150. However, if you start low, you lose potential profit.

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes you don't need to lie to Bob about the product's value or availability. Ethical considerations are important in any negotiation."
