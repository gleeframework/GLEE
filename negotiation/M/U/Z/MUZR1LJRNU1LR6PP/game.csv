"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity to consider this product.  I'm interested, but $12000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go right now.  How about $10000? I'm confident we can reach a mutually agreeable price.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob. However, I have to consider my own minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $11500. Can you meet me there?",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  I'm still trying to stay within my budget, and $11500 is a little too high for me right now.  How about we split the difference and go with $11000? I'm confident this price works for both of us.",11000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm thinking $12500 is a fair compromise. What do you think?",12500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $12500 is still too high for me.  Let's try $11250. That's a fair compromise and closer to where I need to be. I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",11250.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. I'm getting closer to my minimum price, but I still need to get a bit more. I'm willing to meet you at $13000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us.",13000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're firm on your price, but $13000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $12000. That's a good price for me, and it's still a good profit for you. Let's close this deal.",12000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go any lower than my last offer, Bob. However, I'm willing to make a slight concession. I'll meet you at $12500. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's the best price we can both agree on.",12500.0,Alice,9,
