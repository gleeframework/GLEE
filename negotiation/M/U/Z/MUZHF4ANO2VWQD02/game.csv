,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $140 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. How about $125? I'm sure we can find a middle ground.",125.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $125 is unfortunately too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $132.50? I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us.",132.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $132.50 is still a bit too high for me. How about we settle on $130? It's closer to my budget, and I'm really interested in this product.",130.0,Bob,4,
