"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product but $11,500 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps closer to $10000?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob.  While I value the product highly, I'm willing to negotiate. How about we settle at $11,000? It's a fair compromise that reflects the product's true worth.",11000.0,Alice,3,
