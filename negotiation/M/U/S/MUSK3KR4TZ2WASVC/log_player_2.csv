Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm afraid $800,000 is a bit low for me.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to get a good deal, Bob, but $950,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'm thinking of a price of $1,025,000. This is as low as I can go, but I'm willing to consider it. What do you think?

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for working with me on this. I understand this is your bottom line, but I'm afraid $1,025,000 is still a bit too high for my budget.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but $975,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm not willing to go any lower than $1,050,000, and I'm starting to think it's time for me to explore other options. I'm giving you one last chance to meet me at $1,050,000. If not, I'll have to consider other buyers. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly holding firm to a price above your budget and has even threatened to walk away.  While you could try to negotiate further, the risk of losing the deal and not getting a better price from Alice is high.  At this point, John's offer of $1,200,000 is more attractive than continuing to negotiate with Alice and potentially ending up with nothing."
