"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product that I'm sure you'll love. I'm thinking of a price of $1,500,000 for it. What do you think?",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. However, that price is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $800,000 for the product.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm afraid $800,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so I'm thinking of a price of $1,200,000. However, I'm willing to make a slight concession to $1,100,000. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate you meeting me closer to the middle ground. While $1,100,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm aiming for a price closer to $950,000.  Would you be willing to consider that?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to get a good deal, Bob, but $950,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'm thinking of a price of $1,025,000. This is as low as I can go, but I'm willing to consider it. What do you think?",1025000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for working with me on this. I understand this is your bottom line, but I'm afraid $1,025,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. I can make a firm offer of $975,000. This offer reflects the value I place on the product while acknowledging its worth to you. Let me know what you think.",975000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but $975,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm not willing to go any lower than $1,050,000, and I'm starting to think it's time for me to explore other options. I'm giving you one last chance to meet me at $1,050,000. If not, I'll have to consider other buyers. What do you say?",1050000.0,Alice,7,
