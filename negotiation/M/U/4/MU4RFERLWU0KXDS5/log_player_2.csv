"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to sell you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. Would you like to buy it from me for $100? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

Let's try to negotiate a better price with Alice before resorting to John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""That's a bit too steep for me, Alice. How about $85?"",

}
``` 

I'm aiming to get the price closer to Alice's perceived value of $80 without being too aggressive initially. There's room to negotiate further if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a good deal, but I think $95 is a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is coming down, but there's still room for negotiation. I'll try a counteroffer slightly below her current offer to see if we can meet in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me on the price, Alice.  How about we settle at $90?"",
""product_price"": 90
}
``` 

This counteroffer aims to split the difference between her last offer ($95) and my previous counteroffer ($85). This shows a willingness to compromise while still working towards a price closer to my target."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting close to my minimum price, but I think we can meet in the middle. How about we say $97.50? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $97.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $97.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice is clearly signaling that she's nearing her bottom line. While I could try to push for a slightly lower price, the potential savings are minimal at this point. Accepting her offer at $97.50 secures a reasonable deal and avoids the risk of her walking away from the negotiation."
