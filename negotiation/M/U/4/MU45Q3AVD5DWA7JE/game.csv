"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is way too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $9,000 for the product. Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I'm afraid $9,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to compromise and sell the product to you for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, $12,000 is still more than I had in mind. Would you consider $10,000? I think that's a fair offer.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable with $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $11,500. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",11500.0,Alice,5,
