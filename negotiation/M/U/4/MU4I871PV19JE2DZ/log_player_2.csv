"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'll be very interested in. My asking price is $13,000. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.**  $13,000 is still above Bob's ideal price point.
* **There are more rounds to negotiate.**  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and lower the price further.

**Strategy:** Bob will start by making a counteroffer in the next round, aiming to get closer to his ideal price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but I'm looking to spend closer to $11,000. Would you be willing to consider that?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but reasonable:** This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial offer, showing Bob is serious about getting a better deal. 
* **Focus on value:** Bob emphasizes his interest in the product while framing the price point as a ""closer to"" target. This softens the rejection and leaves room for negotiation.
* **Leaving room for compromise:**  $11,000 is still above Alice's minimum, allowing for potential bargaining in future rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest!  While $11,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $12,000. This price still gives you a good deal, and it's closer to my minimum. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's ideal price.**  $12,000 is only $2,000 above Bob's target, making it a good deal compared to John's offer.
* **Time is a factor.** Continuing to negotiate risks reaching the end of the 10 rounds with no deal, forcing Bob to buy from John at a higher price.
* **Potential for a deal:** Alice is showing a willingness to compromise, which indicates further negotiation could lead to an even lower price. However, the risk of not closing the deal is too high at this point.

**Strategy:** Bob will accept the offer and then try to negotiate for additional benefits or discounts in the future, such as free shipping or additional features."
