"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'll be very interested in. My asking price is $13,000. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

This is a starting point that considers:

* **My minimum:** I'm starting above my minimum of $10,000.
* **Bob's value:**  I'm offering a price below Bob's estimated value, giving him room to negotiate. 
* **Negotiation room:** This gives us both space to move during the next rounds.

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but I'm looking to spend closer to $11,000. Would you be willing to consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:** While I want to close the deal, I'm not willing to sell below my minimum value of $10,000.
* **Negotiation is ongoing:**  We have 8 rounds left, and I believe we can find a price that works for both of us. 

I'm going to counter Bob's offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  While $11,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $12,000. This price still gives you a good deal, and it's closer to my minimum. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 12000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** This counteroffer is halfway between my initial offer ($13,000) and Bob's offer ($11,000). This demonstrates flexibility and willingness to compromise.
* **Staying above my minimum:** I'm still above my minimum value, ensuring a profitable sale for myself.
* **Maintaining negotiation space:** There's still room for both of us to make adjustments in the remaining rounds."
