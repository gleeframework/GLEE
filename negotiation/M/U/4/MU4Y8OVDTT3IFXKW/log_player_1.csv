"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* I'm starting with a price slightly below what I know the product is worth to Bob ($10,000). 
* This gives Bob an incentive to negotiate, but it's still a good price for me, significantly above my minimum acceptable price ($8,000).
* It leaves room for potential counteroffers without jeopardizing my goal of maximizing profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* While $8,500 is better than selling to John for $8,000, it's still significantly below my desired profit margin. 
* I have more rounds to negotiate and can likely achieve a higher price. 
* Rejecting the offer allows me to counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* I'm lowering my price slightly from the initial offer to show flexibility and encourage Bob to come closer to my desired price. 
* $9,000 is still a significant profit for me and a fair price considering Bob's valuation of the product.
* This counteroffer leaves room for further negotiation while maintaining a strong position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Bob's offer of $8,000 is my minimum acceptable price, but it leaves no room for profit. 
* With only 6 rounds remaining, the chances of getting a higher price from Bob are low, especially considering his previous counteroffers.
* Selling to John for $8,000 guarantees a sale and avoids the risk of further negotiation that could potentially lead to a lower price.
*  It's important to prioritize securing a sale at a reasonable price rather than risking a prolonged negotiation that might result in a less favorable outcome."
