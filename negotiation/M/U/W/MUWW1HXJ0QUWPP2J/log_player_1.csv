Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product.  I believe it would be incredibly valuable to you, and I'm willing to part with it for $1,450,000."", ""product_price"": 1450000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, you want to see if Bob will pay more. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high but below your guaranteed price leaves room for Bob to negotiate down, potentially landing you a price higher than John's offer.
* **Appeal to Value:** The message emphasizes the product's value to Bob, justifying the high price. 
 
**Important Considerations:**

* This strategy assumes you have time for potential back-and-forth with Bob. If you need to sell quickly, a price closer to John's offer might be wiser. 
* Bob's willingness to negotiate is unknown. He might outright reject the offer, knowing the product is worth less to him."
