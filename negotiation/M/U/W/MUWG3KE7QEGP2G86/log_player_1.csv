"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $200 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be comfortable paying $100. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your position, but $100 is too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $170?"", ""product_price"": 170}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm still interested in the product, but $170 is still above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $130. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

While I could push for a bit more, accepting $130 is a reasonable compromise. It's significantly more than Bob initially offered and avoids the risk of him walking away from the deal."
