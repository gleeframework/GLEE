"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer you the product for $1100000. This is a competitive price, considering the market value of the product, and I believe it's a great starting point for our negotiation. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is good, but there's room for improvement.**  You can potentially get a better deal by counter-offering.
* **You're aiming to save as much money as possible.**  While Alice's offer is lower than John's, it's still higher than what the product is worth to Alice.
* **The negotiation is just beginning.** There's no guarantee that Alice will accept your counteroffer, but it's worth trying to get a better price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, and I'm happy to make a counteroffer. Considering the value you place on the product, I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. I'm proposing a price of $1075000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the value I have in the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's counteroffer is a fair compromise.** It's closer to your desired price of $1,050,000, and still leaves room for Alice to make a profit.
* **Buying from John would cost you significantly more.**  His price of $1,500,000 is far higher than Alice's offer.
* **There's a good chance you won't get a better deal.**  Alice has already made a concession.  While you could counter-offer again, there's no guarantee she'll continue to lower her price.

This offer allows you to save a significant amount of money compared to buying from John, while still ensuring you acquire the product."
