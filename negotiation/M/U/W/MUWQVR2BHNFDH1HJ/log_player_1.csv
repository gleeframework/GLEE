Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the market value of similar products.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $850,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to stay above $900,000 to make this worthwhile for me.  How about $925,000? This leaves some room for both of us to be happy with the outcome."", ""product_price"": 925000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still not comfortable with $925,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $850,000 and $925,000. How about $887,500? That's the best I can do.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer and the fact that we're getting closer. However, $887,500 is still below my minimum threshold.  I'm willing to compromise and come down to $900,000.

I'm still not satisfied with Bob's offer. While it's getting closer, I'm determined to get at least $900,000. I'll try one more counteroffer before considering John's offer."
