"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth $12,000 to you, and we're looking to maximize our earnings. Let's start with a fair offer. Would you be interested in purchasing the product for $11,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:** While it's lower than what the product is worth to you, it's still above your desired price point.  
* **Negotiation is possible:** There's room to negotiate, and you want to save as much money as you can. 
* **John's offer is a safety net:**  Knowing John is willing to sell for $12,000 provides a fallback option."

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. We understand your position and would like to make a competitive offer. Considering the value of the product to both of us, we propose a price of $10,750 for the product. This allows us to earn more while staying within your budget. Please let us know if this is acceptable. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,750.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high:** While closer to your target, $10,750 is still above your desired price point of $10,500.
* **More negotiation is possible:**  You believe you can still get a better price.
* **John's offer is a safety net:** You still have John's offer as a backup."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,750 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference - I'll pay $10,625 for the product. This is a fair price for both of us, and it gets us closer to a deal."", ""product_price"": 10625}

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your proposal, Bob. We've considered your offer carefully, and we're willing to meet you halfway. We propose a price of $10,650 for the product. This allows us to earn a reasonable profit while remaining competitive with your offer. Please let us know if this is acceptable. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,650. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,650
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is close to your target:** $10,650 is only $25 more than your last counteroffer, and is within your acceptable range.
* **Further negotiation may be unproductive:**  At this point, continuing to negotiate risks either getting stuck at a stalemate or Alice becoming unwilling to negotiate further.
* **John's offer is a safety net:** While you'd prefer a lower price, John's offer provides a guaranteed backup.

It's a good deal to accept. You've saved a significant amount compared to John's offer, and the negotiation has reached a point where further bargaining might not yield a substantially better result."
