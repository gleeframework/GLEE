"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit too steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can reach a deal.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000, recognizing your interest in the product. Let's try to find a common ground.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I'm still interested in the product, but $1,300,000 is still a bit out of my range.  Let's split the difference and go with $1,250,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and allows us to move forward with the transaction.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
