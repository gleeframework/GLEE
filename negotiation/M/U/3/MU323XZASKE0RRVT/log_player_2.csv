"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's worth a lot to me, but I believe you'll find it equally valuable. I'm asking $1,400,000 for it. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is too high.  I can potentially get a better deal by negotiating further.  It's also worth noting that I have a fallback option with John, so I'm not under extreme pressure to accept immediately."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit too steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can reach a deal."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000, recognizing your interest in the product. Let's try to find a common ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high.  While it's a step in the right direction, I believe I can still get a better deal with further negotiation.  I want to keep pushing for a price closer to my target of $1,200,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm still interested in the product, but $1,300,000 is still a bit out of my range.  Let's split the difference and go with $1,250,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and allows us to move forward with the transaction."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective. Let's meet in the middle at $1,275,000.  This offer reflects the value of the product and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,275,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,275,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,275,000 is within my budget and a good compromise.  While I would prefer to pay closer to $1,200,000, I risk losing the deal if I continue to counteroffer.  It's also worth noting that I have a fallback option with John, but at a higher price.  Accepting this offer allows me to secure the product at a reasonable price."
