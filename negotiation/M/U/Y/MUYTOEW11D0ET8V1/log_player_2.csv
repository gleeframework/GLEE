"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be of significant value to you. I'm offering it to you at a price of $1,250,000. This is a fair price, considering the product's worth to you and my own minimum value. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice's opening offer is halfway between our valuations. While it's tempting to accept and secure a decent deal, there's room for negotiation. We can likely get the price lower with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but I'm working with a tighter budget. Would you be willing to come down to $1,100,000?"",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:** We're starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's opening but still leaves room for further negotiation. This approach aims to:

* **Establish a lower price point:**  By anchoring our offer lower, we try to shift the negotiation range downwards. 
* **Gauge Alice's flexibility:**  Her reaction to this counteroffer will give us valuable insight into how much she's willing to budge.

We'll adjust our strategy based on Alice's response to this counteroffer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While I understand your budget concerns, $1,100,000 doesn't reflect the true value this product offers. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. This price still leaves me a reasonable profit and gives you a significant advantage over other potential buyers. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice moved down slightly from her initial offer, indicating some willingness to negotiate. However, the current price is still closer to our desired range. We'll continue negotiating to see if we can push the price closer to $1,050,000."
