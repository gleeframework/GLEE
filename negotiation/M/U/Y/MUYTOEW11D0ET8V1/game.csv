"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While I understand your budget concerns, $1,100,000 doesn't reflect the true value this product offers. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. This price still leaves me a reasonable profit and gives you a significant advantage over other potential buyers.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
