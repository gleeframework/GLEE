Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be of significant value to you. I'm offering it to you at a price of $1,250,000. This is a fair price, considering the product's worth to you and my own minimum value. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting Point:**  I'm offering a price that's higher than my minimum but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Reasoning:** I want to maximize my profit, but I also need to incentivize Bob to accept. A too-high price could lead to immediate rejection.
* **Strategic Advantage:** By making the first offer, I establish the negotiation framework and show confidence in my product's value. 

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob rejects, I'll assess his counteroffer and adjust my strategy accordingly.
* If Bob's counteroffer is too low, I'll make a counter-counteroffer, ideally closer to my initial price.
* If negotiations stall, I'm ready to sell to John for $1,000,000, ensuring I still get a good return."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but I'm working with a tighter budget. Would you be willing to come down to $1,100,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  While it's higher than John's offer, it's significantly below my desired profit margin and my initial assessment of the product's value to Bob.
* **Potential for a better deal:**  There's still room for negotiation. I believe Bob is genuinely interested and will likely be willing to pay more.
* **Strategic advantage:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I maintain control of the negotiation and show that I'm not desperate to sell.

**Next Steps:**

I'll counteroffer Bob, aiming for a price closer to my initial $1,250,000. I'll use the fact that Bob is already willing to pay more than John as leverage."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While I understand your budget concerns, $1,100,000 doesn't reflect the true value this product offers. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. This price still leaves me a reasonable profit and gives you a significant advantage over other potential buyers."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a higher price. 
* **Leverage:**  I'm highlighting Bob's interest and the value of the product as a reason for him to consider this offer.
* **Strategic Middle Ground:** $1,150,000 is a halfway point between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer, making it a reasonable compromise.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, I've secured a good deal.
* If Bob rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and determine if it's worth negotiating further or if I should accept John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,050,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value it holds for me while still being profitable for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** Bob's offer of $1,050,000 is only slightly higher than John's offer of $1,000,000. This margin is not significant enough to justify the risk of further negotiations.
* **Time is money:** Continuing negotiations with Bob could drag on, and the longer the process takes, the more likely it is that I could lose out on potential buyers or opportunities.
* **Guaranteed profit:**  John's offer guarantees me a profit of $1,000,000, which is my minimum target. 

**Conclusion:**

It's best to accept John's offer and avoid further negotiations with Bob, who is clearly not willing to meet my price expectations."
