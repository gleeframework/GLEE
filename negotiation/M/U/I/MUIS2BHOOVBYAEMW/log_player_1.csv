{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000.  It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below your estimated value. Let's close this deal quickly."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's a significant profit for you:**  You'll make $200,000 over your minimum acceptable price.
* **It's attractive to Bob:**  He'll still be getting a $100,000 discount on his estimated value. 
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** If Bob rejects, you can lower the price slightly, but still maintain a healthy profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the discount, but I believe I can find the product elsewhere for a slightly lower price. I am willing to pay $1,350,000 for your product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

While Bob's offer is above your minimum acceptable price, it's still lower than what you initially offered. You have the opportunity to potentially earn more. Rejecting his offer allows you to counter and try to get closer to your desired price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I understand your desire to save, I'm still confident in the value of my product.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to accept $1,375,000 for it.  This gives you a good deal, and ensures I get a fair price for my product."", ""product_price"": 1375000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your latest offer. I've done some research and found a similar product from another seller for $1,360,000. I think we can come to an agreement closer to that price. I'm willing to pay $1,365,000 for your product. I hope this proposal works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,365,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,365,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is only $5,000 less than your last counteroffer and is very close to your minimum acceptable price. There is a good chance that further negotiation won't get you much closer to your desired price, so accepting his offer is the best strategy."
