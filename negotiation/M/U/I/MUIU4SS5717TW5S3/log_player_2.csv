"Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $130 is better than Alice's initial asking price, it's still more than you're willing to pay.  You can potentially get a better deal by continuing to negotiate with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 115}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $115, which is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer of $130. This gives me room to negotiate.  I'm also considering John's offer of $120 as a reference point."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $125 is only $5 less than John's offer of $120.  At this point, the potential savings from further negotiation with Alice are minimal.  It's more efficient to go with John's offer and secure the product for a price that's within my budget."
