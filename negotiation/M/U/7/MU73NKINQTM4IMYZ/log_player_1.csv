I'm starting with an offer of $15,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value, but leaves room for negotiation if Bob is truly interested. It's important to remember that I can always sell to John for $10,000 if I don't reach a satisfactory agreement with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

While $12,000 is a decent price, I'm still aiming for a higher sale. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to push for a price closer to my initial offer."

I'm counteroffering at $13,500. This is a compromise, but it still allows me to make a profit beyond my minimum value. I hope this price will be attractive enough to Bob to reach an agreement."

Bob has come up to $12,500. While I'd prefer my initial price, this is a good price and ensures I make a significant profit. I'll accept this offer."
