{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$10,000:**  This price is a good starting point. It's significantly higher than Bob's perceived value, but still lower than my minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest.
* **Message:** This message is friendly and encouraging, highlighting the potential for a mutually beneficial deal. It avoids being aggressive or pushy.

**Strategy:**

* **Start high:**  By starting at $10,000, I maximize my potential profit.
* **Leave room for negotiation:**  The difference between my asking price and Bob's value allows for negotiation and a potential compromise.
* **Keep John in mind:**  Knowing that I have another buyer at $12,000 sets a limit on how low I'm willing to go."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. That's the most I'm willing to pay. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $8,500 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum price of $12,000. I'm not willing to sell the product for that price, especially considering I have another buyer willing to pay $12,000. 

**Next Steps:**

I will counteroffer Bob with a price closer to my minimum. This will give him a chance to reconsider, but I will not accept any offer below my minimum."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $8,500 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $9,500. This is still a great deal for you, as it's well below what the product is worth to me. Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm offering $9,500. This is a significant move from my initial offer of $10,000, demonstrating flexibility and willingness to negotiate. 
* **Reasoning:**  I'm using my knowledge of the product's value to me and Bob's perceived value to justify the price. I'm also reminding Bob of the potential value he stands to gain. 
* **Leaving room for compromise:**  While $9,500 is close to my minimum, there's still some room for negotiation if Bob is truly serious about buying the product. 

**Strategy:**

* **Be firm, but fair:**  I'm not willing to go below $9,500.
* **Highlight the benefits for Bob:** I'm reminding him of the value he'll get by purchasing the product.
* **Staying open to negotiation:**  I'm open to further negotiations, but only if Bob is willing to move closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $9,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $9,000. That's the lowest I can go, but I'm really interested in the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $9,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired price point. I'm not willing to accept an offer that doesn't at least meet my minimum of $12,000.  

**Next Steps:**

* **Counteroffer:** I will make another counteroffer to Bob, likely closer to $10,000. 
* **Remain firm:**  I will continue to hold my ground, knowing I have a guaranteed buyer in John.
* **Gauge Bob's commitment:** I'll watch for any signs that Bob might be willing to raise his offer or is close to his limit."

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $9,000 is still too far from what this product is worth. I'm willing to go down to $9,800, which is a good compromise for both of us. This price reflects the value of the product, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9800}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:**  I'm offering $9,800, which is a small concession from my previous offer of $9,500. This shows flexibility while still staying above my minimum price.
* **Reasoning:** I'm reaffirming the value of the product and emphasizing the fairness of the price. 
* **Maintaining a firm stance:** While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm not willing to go below my minimum of $12,000.  
* **Creating pressure:** I'm putting the ball back in Bob's court and reminding him that he's running the risk of losing the opportunity if he doesn't accept the offer. 

**Strategy:**

* **Be firm, yet reasonable:** I'm making a small concession but still holding firm on my minimum.
* **Highlight the compromise:** I'm framing the offer as a win-win for both parties.
* **Push for a decision:** I'm putting pressure on Bob to decide and avoid further delays."

# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $9,800 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $9,200. I'm really interested in the product and I'm willing to pay a premium, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider this price?

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

**Decision:**

I will sell the product to John for $12,000. This ensures I get my minimum price and avoids further negotiation with Bob."
