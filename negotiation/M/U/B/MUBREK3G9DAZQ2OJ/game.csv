"Hi Bob, I'm offering my product to you for $135. It's in great condition and worth a lot to you, so I'm sure you'll agree it's a fair price. Let me know what you think!",135.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $135 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $100?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, though. How about $115? That's still a great deal for you considering the value of the product.",115.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me. How about we split the difference and settle at $107.50?",107.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $107.50 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with.  Let's meet in the middle at $111.25.  This is a fair price for both of us.",111.25,Alice,5,
