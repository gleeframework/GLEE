"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,800,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is closer to $800,000.  Would you be willing to consider a price closer to that? ",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer.  However,  $800,000 is significantly below its true value and what I'm willing to accept.  To find a middle ground, I propose a price of $1,400,000. I believe this reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your interest.",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but $1,400,000 is still a bit outside my range.  I'm confident we can find a mutually agreeable price point.  How about $1,000,000? This would be a fair price for both of us and allow for a smooth transaction. ",1000000.0,Bob,4,
