"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this truly unique product. I believe it holds immense value, and I'm confident it can greatly benefit you as well. Given its potential, I'm offering it for $1,800,000.  I'm open to discussing this further, so please let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer of $1,800,000 is far above your budget of $800,000. It's definitely worth rejecting and making a counteroffer to see if we can reach a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,800,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is closer to $800,000.  Would you be willing to consider a price closer to that? "", ""product_price"": 800000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer.  However,  $800,000 is significantly below its true value and what I'm willing to accept.  To find a middle ground, I propose a price of $1,400,000. I believe this reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your interest. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,400,000 is still above my budget, but it's a good sign she's willing to negotiate. I'll reject her offer and try to push for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but $1,400,000 is still a bit outside my range.  I'm confident we can find a mutually agreeable price point.  How about $1,000,000? This would be a fair price for both of us and allow for a smooth transaction. "", ""product_price"": 1000000}
