{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm confident it would be a worthwhile investment for you.  I'm willing to part with it for $950,000.  This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 950000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While John guarantees $1,000,000, there's a chance to earn even more from Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:** The offer is significantly higher than Bob's valuation ($800,000) but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  Mentioning ""other interested parties"" encourages Bob to act quickly.
* **Confident but not Greedy:** A price closer to $1,000,000 might make Bob walk away immediately.  This offer aims to start a conversation."
