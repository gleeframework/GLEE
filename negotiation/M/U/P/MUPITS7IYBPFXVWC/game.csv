"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $18,000 is a bit too high for my budget.  I'm interested in the product, but I would only be willing to pay around $10,000 for it. Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $18,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to sell it for $10,000. However, I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm now offering the product to you for $14,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I think you'll really appreciate its features.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving a bit on the price.  While $14,000 is closer, it's still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. Would you consider $11,500? I feel that's a fair compromise.",11500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $14,000 is still a bit above your budget, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $11,500. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm now offering the product to you for $13,500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a fair deal considering the product's value to you.",13500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for your flexibility. I understand this is your lowest price and I appreciate the concessions you've made. However, $13,500 is still a bit of a stretch for me. I can offer you $12,000. This is a firm offer, and I believe it is more than fair for both of us.  Let me know your thoughts.",12000.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $12,000 is a firm offer, and I appreciate your willingness to make a counteroffer. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum acceptable price. I'm now offering the product to you for $13,000. This is the final offer I'm willing to make, and I think it's a fair compromise considering the product's value to you.",13000.0,Alice,7,
