"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you considering me for this product. I'm very interested but $12,000 is a bit higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $10,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $10,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can do $11,000 for the product. It's a fair price considering its value to you, and I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thanks for being flexible. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still a bit over budget at $11,000. How about $10,500? It's a fair price considering the value of the product and would allow us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",10500.0,Bob,4,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. I'm getting closer to my budget, but $11,250 is still a bit high. How about $10,750?  It's a fair offer considering the product's value and would allow both of us to walk away happy. Let's make this deal happen.",10750.0,Bob,6,

"Alice, thanks for being so understanding.  I'm really hoping to close this deal and I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.  I'm still a little above my budget at $11,500.  How about we split the difference and I pay $11,000?  This way, we both get a good deal and we can move forward.  What do you think?",11000.0,Bob,8,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob! However, I'm starting to feel that we're getting close to the minimum price I'm willing to accept. I'm willing to meet you at $11,250 was my previous best offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower than that. If you're still interested, I'd be happy to discuss further, but I need to prioritize my own goals. What do you think?",11250.0,Alice,9,
