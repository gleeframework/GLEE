Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I believe would be a great asset for you. I'm open to negotiation, but I'm looking for at least $15,000 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price that's above my minimum ($10,000) but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffers:**  I've made it clear that I'm open to negotiation, encouraging Bob to counteroffer. 
* **Focus on Value:**  The message highlights the potential value of the product for Bob. 
* **Setting the Floor:**  By mentioning the minimum price I'm looking for, I establish a baseline for negotiations. 

This strategy allows me to gauge Bob's interest and potential willingness to pay while keeping the negotiation process open."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $12000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my desired price, but it's still above my minimum.  Rejecting his offer allows me to counter with a price that's more in line with my expectations while keeping the negotiations going."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the counteroffer.  I appreciate your interest.  $12,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $13,500?  I'm confident you'll find this product worth the investment."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** I'm proposing a price that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer. This shows I'm willing to compromise.
* **Positive Reinforcement:** I'm thanking Bob for his counteroffer and emphasizing my belief in the product's value to him.
* **Clear Offer:** I'm stating my counteroffer clearly to avoid any confusion.

This counteroffer demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while staying firm on my price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, $13500 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $12500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Desired Price:** Bob's offer of $12,500 is only $500 below my previous counteroffer.  This is a good compromise and closer to my desired price.
* **Risk of Losing Deal:** If I reject his offer and counter again, there's a risk he'll walk away entirely. 
* **Opportunity Cost:**  Selling to John for $10,000 would be significantly lower than this offer. 

Accepting Bob's offer is the best option to secure a good price without jeopardizing the sale or taking a huge financial hit."
