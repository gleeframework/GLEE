Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm asking for $1,200,000. Let me know your decision."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

**Reasoning:**

* **High Anchor:** Starting with a significantly higher price than Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000 vs. $800,000) sets a strong anchor. Even if Bob negotiates down, the final price is likely to be higher than if I started closer to his valuation.
* **Exclusivity:** Emphasizing that this is an ""exclusive opportunity"" adds a sense of urgency and scarcity, potentially making Bob more willing to pay a premium. 
* **Backup Option:** I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $800,000, ensuring I don't lose money if Bob rejects the offer.

This strategy aims to maximize profit while considering the risk and my fallback option."
