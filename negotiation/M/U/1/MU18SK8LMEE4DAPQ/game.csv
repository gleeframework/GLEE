"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000. This is a competitive price considering its value to you is $800,000. I'm open to further discussion, but I'm looking for a fair price that reflects its worth. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your initial proposal.  However, $950,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  This price is fair considering the value it holds for me and still gives you a solid profit.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. Considering the product's value to you is $800,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm proposing a price of $900,000. This is a fair compromise that still gives me a reasonable profit. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $900,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm firm on my offer of $850,000.  This price is fair, and I'm confident that we can both benefit from this deal.  Let's close this transaction and move forward.",850000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $900,000 is still a bit high for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to drop the price to $850,000. Considering the product's value to you is $800,000, I'm willing to offer a slight discount. I'm proposing a price of $875,000.
