Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I like your persistence, Bob! I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I still need to make a profit, and $950,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you at $1,050,000, but that's as low as I can go. This is a fair price considering the product's value and what I've already offered. What do you think?

Alice is very unlikely to go below $1,000,000, and it's not worth the risk of further negotiation. Buying from John guarantees the best price."
