{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know if you're interested. "", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point.  It's the minimum I'm willing to accept, as I have a guaranteed buyer in John. However, I'm hoping Bob will be eager to purchase and may be willing to pay a bit more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $1,000,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $700,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $700,000 is a significant amount, it's still below my minimum.  I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer and see if we can come to a mutually agreeable number."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and I'm happy to negotiate.  However, $700,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000, which is still a great deal for a product worth $1,000,000 to you.  Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. How about we meet in the middle at $800,000? That's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

$800,000 is a good compromise, and it's getting closer to my minimum. While I'd prefer to get closer to $900,000, accepting this offer means I can avoid any further haggling and secure a sale.  It's also significantly more than what John is offering."
