"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to buy this product, which I know you'll find valuable. I'm asking for $140. It's a great deal for something you'll get so much use out of! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

``` 

**Explanation:**

While $140 is cheaper than John's price, it's still above your maximum budget of $150. You're better off rejecting Alice's offer and buying from John, as your goal is to save as much money as possible."
