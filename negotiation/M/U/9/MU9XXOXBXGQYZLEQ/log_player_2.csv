"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $17,000. It's a great deal for you, as you know it's worth $15,000 to you. I'm confident this product will be a valuable asset for your needs. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Alice's initial offer is above Bob's maximum value for the product.  It's better to reject and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the value of the product,  $17,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $14,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 14000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $14,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer. How about $16,000?  This still gives you a good value, and it's closer to where I need to be.  Let's make this happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is still above Bob's desired price point. Although it's closer, Bob can still try to negotiate a lower price. It's worth seeing if Alice will come down further before considering buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $16,000 is still a bit higher than I can comfortably go.  Let's split the difference.  I'll offer $15,500 for the product.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it gets us closer to a deal."", ""product_price"": 15500}
