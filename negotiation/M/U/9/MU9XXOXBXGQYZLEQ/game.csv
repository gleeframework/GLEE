"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $17,000. It's a great deal for you, as you know it's worth $15,000 to you. I'm confident this product will be a valuable asset for your needs. Let me know what you think!",17000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the value of the product,  $17,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $14,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",14000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $14,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer. How about $16,000?  This still gives you a good value, and it's closer to where I need to be.  Let's make this happen!",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $16,000 is still a bit higher than I can comfortably go.  Let's split the difference.  I'll offer $15,500 for the product.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it gets us closer to a deal.",15500.0,Bob,4,
