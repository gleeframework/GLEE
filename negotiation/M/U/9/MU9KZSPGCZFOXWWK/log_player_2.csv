"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe you'd be very interested in. It's worth a lot to you, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable.  I'm willing to offer it to you for $14,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as I'm sure you'll agree. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $14,000 is less than your maximum budget, it's still higher than John's offer of $15,000. You can save $1,000 by going with John. 

Since your goal is to save money and you have a guaranteed alternative at a lower price, rejecting Alice's offer makes the most sense."
