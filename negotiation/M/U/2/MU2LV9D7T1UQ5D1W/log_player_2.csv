"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. I believe it's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $14,000 is a better price than John's $15,000, Bob can likely get a better deal by negotiating with Alice. He should reject the initial offer and see if he can push for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $12,500 for the product. Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $12,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $13,500.  This is a fair compromise considering the value of the product to you. Let me know if you're interested in this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:**  Alice's offer of $13,500 is lower than John's $15,000. 
* **Close to Bob's target:** Bob's goal was to save as much money as possible, and $13,500 is reasonably close to his desired price point.
* **Further negotiation could be risky:**  Further negotiation might lead to a lower price, but there's a risk that Alice will walk away from the deal. It's safer to accept this offer and secure the product at a good price."
