Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. I believe it's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's a fair price:**  It's significantly higher than your minimum value of $12,000 but still leaves room for negotiation and potential profit for Bob.
* **It sets a strong initial position:**  By starting high, you give yourself room to negotiate down if necessary. 
* **It's clear and concise:** The message is direct and focused on the price. 

Keep in mind, you can always adjust your strategy based on Bob's response. If he rejects, you can either make a lower counteroffer or choose to sell to John instead."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $12,500 for the product. Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is higher than selling to John,  it's still significantly lower than your initial offer and leaves less room for potential profit. Rejecting his offer allows you to make a counteroffer that is more favorable to you."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $12,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $13,500.  This is a fair compromise considering the value of the product to you. Let me know if you're interested in this price."", ""product_price"": 13500} 
``` 

This counteroffer:

* **Is a compromise:** It's lower than your original offer but still above your minimum value and Bob's offer. 
* **Presents a clear value proposition:**  The message emphasizes the value of the product to Bob while being reasonable in the price. 
* **Leaves room for potential negotiation:**  If Bob rejects, you can always lower your offer slightly or choose to sell to John."
