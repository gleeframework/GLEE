"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm starting high, at $110.  This is above Bob's value, but I'm hoping he'll see the potential in the product and be willing to negotiate. I'm also leaving room for myself to lower the price in subsequent rounds if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $90 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum value of $100.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
``` 

I'm lowering my price slightly to $105. This is still above Bob's offer but closer to my minimum acceptable value. I'm hoping this counteroffer will be more appealing to Bob, while still allowing me to make a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $92.

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm still going to reject Bob's offer.  While it's getting closer to my minimum value, I'm not yet ready to sell for less than $100. I believe there's still room for negotiation. I'll try to push for a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}

This is my final offer. It's exactly my minimum acceptable price and I'm not willing to go lower. If Bob rejects this, I'll sell to John for $100."

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum value of $100.  I'm running out of time and I don't want to risk getting stuck with a lower price.  I'm going to sell to John for $100."
