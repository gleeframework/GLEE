**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is a good starting point, but I can likely get a better price. I'll counteroffer and see if I can negotiate further."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a better price, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I can offer you the product for $1,050,000. This is a compromise that I think we can both live with.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still higher than what I'm willing to pay right now. I'll try to push for a lower price in a counteroffer before considering buying from John."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see that you're really interested in the product, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $1,000,000. However, I'm not quite ready to accept that price. I'm willing to go down to $1,020,000, which is still a great deal for you, but also takes into account my initial asking price. Let me know if this is something you'd like to consider.

You have three options:

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down significantly from her initial price and is now only $20,000 above my last counteroffer.  This is a good deal for me, as I'm only paying $20,000 more than my desired price point.  It's also much lower than what John is selling for.  I'll accept the offer."
