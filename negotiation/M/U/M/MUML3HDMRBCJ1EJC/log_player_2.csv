"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase a product that I believe will be incredibly valuable to your business. I understand it's worth at least $1,000,000 to you, and I'm willing to let it go for a price that's mutually beneficial.  Let's discuss a figure that makes sense for both of us.  What do you think about $950,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer is $950,000, which is less than your maximum budget of $1,000,000.
* Buying from Alice saves you $50,000 compared to buying from John. 
* Even though Alice's product might be worth more to you, the $50,000 savings is a significant benefit."
