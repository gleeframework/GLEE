"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product, but I believe I can't justify spending $20,000 on it. Would you consider lowering the price to $12,000?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is significantly less than what I'm willing to accept.  This product offers tremendous value, and I believe $17,000 is a fair price.  It reflects the quality and potential it holds for your needs.",17000.0,Alice,3,
