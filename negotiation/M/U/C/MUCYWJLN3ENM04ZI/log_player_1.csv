Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

I'm starting with an offer of $15,000. This gives Bob some room to negotiate while still ensuring I get a profit beyond my minimum of $12,000.  I'm also keeping in mind that I can always fall back on John's offer if Bob doesn't meet my expectations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is way too low.  I'm going to reject it and make a counteroffer.  While I can always sell to John, I'd prefer to try and get closer to my desired price."

I'm going to counteroffer Bob with $12,000. This is my minimum acceptable price, and I'm hoping that by being firm, Bob will see the value in my product and come closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is still too low. I'm going to reject it and try one more counteroffer before I consider selling to John. I'm hoping to squeeze a bit more out of this negotiation."

I'm going to counteroffer Bob with $11,000. This is a compromise, and I'm hoping it's enough to entice Bob to finalize the deal. If he rejects this offer, I'll go ahead and sell to John for $12,000."
