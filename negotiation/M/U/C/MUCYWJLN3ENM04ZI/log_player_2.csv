"Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

The product is worth no more than $10,000 to Bob. Alice's offer of $15,000 is too high. It makes sense to reject the offer and see if a better price can be negotiated."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8000}
``` 

Bob offers $8,000, which is significantly lower than Alice's offer but still leaves room for negotiation. This is a good starting point for a counteroffer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $12,000 is closer to Bob's limit, it's still above his desired price.  There's still potential to get a better price by making another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

{""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

Bob is getting closer to his limit, but he wants to see if he can squeeze out a little more.  $9,500 is a good compromise point."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's offer of $11,000 is still above Bob's maximum price of $10,000. It's better for Bob to buy the product from John, who is selling it for $10,000. This ensures that Bob gets the product within his budget."
