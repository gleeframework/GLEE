"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $12000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $15000. I'm confident you'll love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's a good deal compared to John's price, there's still room for negotiation. Bob can try to get a lower price by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I appreciate you considering my needs. However, $12,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer! I understand that $12000 might be a stretch for you, but I'm still confident that this product would bring significant value to your life. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11500. This is a great compromise that still reflects the product's worth to me. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has come down to $11,500, which is a good price for Bob. It's still a bit higher than his ideal price, but it's significantly lower than John's offer. Accepting this offer saves Bob $3,500 compared to buying from John.  While he could try to negotiate further, the risk of losing the deal entirely and having to buy from John makes accepting this offer the most sensible choice."
