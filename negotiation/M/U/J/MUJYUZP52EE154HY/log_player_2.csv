"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its unique features and benefits, I'm proposing a starting price of $13,000. I'm confident this represents a fair deal considering its potential worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $13,000 is less than Bob's maximum, it's still more than the product is worth to Alice.  There's room for negotiation, so rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer is the best initial strategy."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer but I'm hoping to pay closer to $10,000.  I think that's a fair price considering your value for the product.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's initial price, but still higher than the product's worth to Alice.  It's a good starting point for negotiation and leaves room for both parties to compromise.  Bob is making a strong effort to save money while still showing willingness to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your perspective, but $10,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to meet you halfway â€“ how about $11,500? This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the product's worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is moving in the right direction, but $11,500 is still a bit high for Bob.  There's still room for negotiation, and Bob can potentially get a better price.  Rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer will continue the negotiation process and hopefully lead to a price closer to Bob's desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still looking to pay closer to $10,500. This is a fair price that reflects the product's value to me. Let's meet in the middle!"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is sticking to his goal of saving money, but he's also showing that he's willing to compromise.  This counteroffer is only $500 higher than his last offer, indicating a strong desire to reach a deal. This makes it more likely that Alice will accept, or at least counter with a price closer to Bob's desired range."
