Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm selling this awesome product that I think you'll love. I'm asking for $175 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:**  I'm starting with a price higher than John's offer ($150) but still leaving room for negotiation. 
* **Message:** I'm keeping it friendly and positive to encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation. 
* **Strategy:** I'm aiming to maximize my profit, but I also want to keep Bob interested in the deal. Starting high allows for some room to come down and potentially get closer to my minimum acceptable price of $150."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but $175 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $120 for it. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $120 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Negotiation potential:** While I'm not happy with Bob's offer, there's still room for negotiation. I'm willing to counteroffer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price. 
* **Selling to John:** While selling to John for $150 is a safe option, I want to explore if I can get a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget. I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $140? It's a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 140} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** My counteroffer of $140 is closer to Bob's offer, showing a willingness to negotiate. 
* **Reasoning:** I'm aiming to bridge the gap and potentially find a price that's acceptable to both of us. It's still above my minimum acceptable price, but closer to a potential compromise.
* **Message:** I'm keeping the tone positive and emphasizing a win-win situation to encourage further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $140 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $110 for it. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:**  $110 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **Risk of further negotiation:** Continuing to negotiate with Bob risks going even lower and potentially ending up with a price I'm not satisfied with.
* **John's offer is a guaranteed sale:** Selling to John for $150 is a guaranteed sale and meets my minimum acceptable price. It's a safer and more secure option than continuing to negotiate with Bob."
