"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting the conversation, I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm looking for $12,000 for the product.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go as low as $8,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $9,500?

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  However, $9,500 is still a bit of a stretch for me. Would you be open to $8,500? I'm eager to make a deal happen."",

}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice is slowly coming down, but we're still $1,000 away from John's price. I'll make one more counteroffer before considering John's offer."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I'm ready to make a deal today but $9,000 is still more than I'd like to spend. My final offer is $8,750.  If this works for you, I'm ready to move forward."",
""product_price"": 8750
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm starting to feel like we're getting close to a deal. I'm willing to make one more concession. How about $8,900? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice is getting very close to John's price. It's unlikely she'll go much lower, and continuing to negotiate might make me lose the deal entirely. Accepting at $8,900 is a good compromise."
