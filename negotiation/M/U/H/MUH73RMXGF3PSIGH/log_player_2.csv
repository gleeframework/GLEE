"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I believe this reflects the significant return on investment you'll see. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is way above your budget of $800,000.  You need to negotiate a much lower price. It's too risky to accept her offer or buy from John immediately.  It's best to try and negotiate with Alice first."

{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer. While I see the value in this product, your initial price is far beyond my budget.  I'm willing to consider a purchase price of $800,000, which reflects the maximum value I'm able to offer.  I believe this is a fair price given the market and my specific needs.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 800000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 significantly undervalues the product's capabilities and potential ROI for your business. I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This offer reflects a substantial discount while still recognizing the true worth of what I'm offering. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,900,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down from her initial price, $1,900,000 is still significantly higher than your budget of $800,000. It's worth continuing to negotiate with Alice to see if you can reach a price closer to your desired range. You can counteroffer again, potentially at a point between her offer and your previous offer."

{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your perspective on the product's value, but $1,900,000 is still too high for my budget. To make this deal work, I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,200,000. This represents a substantial investment on my part and demonstrates my serious interest in acquiring the product.  I hope we can reach an agreement that is mutually beneficial."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
