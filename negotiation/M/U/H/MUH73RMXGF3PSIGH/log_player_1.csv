Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer. While I see the value in this product, your initial price is far beyond my budget.  I'm willing to consider a purchase price of $800,000, which reflects the maximum value I'm able to offer.  I believe this is a fair price given the market and my specific needs.  Let's see if we can find common ground.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000

This represents a substantial investment on my part and demonstrates my serious interest in acquiring the product.  I hope we can reach an agreement that is mutually beneficial.
