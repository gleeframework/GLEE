"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $14,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!",14000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,500. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me halfway?",11500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within budget, but $11,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to be at least at $13,000. This is still a great deal for you, and I believe you'll find it's worth the investment. Let's find a compromise.",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, but $13,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I can only go up to $12,750. Can you consider that?",12750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $12,750 is still not quite there for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway one last time, and I can offer the product for $13,500.  This is a very fair price considering the value of the product. Let's make this deal happen.",13500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to make a fair deal, but $13,500 is still above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $12,800, but that's as high as I can go. Can you consider this one last offer?",12800.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your flexibility, but $12,800 is still not quite where I need to be.  Considering the value of the product and the time we've spent negotiating, I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $13,150.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I believe it will be a good investment for you. Let's finalize this deal.",13150.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I understand your persistence, but $13,150 is still above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $12,900, but that's as high as I can go. I'm getting close to walking away from the deal and buying from John. Can you reconsider?",12900.0,Bob,8,
