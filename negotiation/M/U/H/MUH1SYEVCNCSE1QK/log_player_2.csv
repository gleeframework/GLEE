"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be a valuable asset to you. Given its value, I'm proposing a starting price of $20,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is way too high.  As Bob, my goal is to save money.  Rejecting the offer allows me to counteroffer and try to get a better price.  I'm not ready to buy from John yet, as I may be able to get a better price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $20,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $16,000.  Let's see if we can find a compromise."", ""product_price"": 16000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but the value of this product is truly significant. How about we meet in the middle at $18,000? This feels like a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $18,000 is closer to my target, it's still too high.  I'm not ready to buy from John yet as I believe I can still get a better price from Alice. Rejecting allows me to counteroffer and hopefully get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $18,000 is still a bit more than I'm willing to pay.  I'm going to stick with my offer of $16,000. I believe that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 16000}
