"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay. I'd be happy to buy it from you for $100. What do you think?",100.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $150 might be a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $100. How about we meet in the middle at $125? I think it's a fair price for this amazing product.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $125 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $110, and I think that's a fair compromise given your initial price.  Let me know what you think.",110.0,Bob,4,
