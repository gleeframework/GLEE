"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $2,000,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I can only offer $850,000. Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is quite a bit lower than I can consider. This product offers significant value that I'm confident will benefit you greatly. How about we meet in the middle? I'm willing to come down to $1,700,000.",1700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand the value of the product, but $1,700,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000.  This is a significant increase from my previous offer, and I believe it demonstrates my serious interest in purchasing the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  While $1,000,000 is closer to the range I had in mind, I can't accept that price at this time.  My absolute floor for this product is $1,400,000.  This is a final offer - I believe it's a fair price that reflects the inherent value of what's being offered. Let me know if this works for you.",1400000.0,Alice,5,
