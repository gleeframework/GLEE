Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the product at a price of $11,000. I believe this product would be highly beneficial to you, even at a premium over its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed buyer at $12,000, it's always better to aim for a higher profit if possible.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $8,000, so offering it at that price or lower guarantees a sale but minimizes my earnings.
* **Negotiation Room:** Starting at $11,000 leaves room for potential negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. 
* **Justification:**  The message emphasizes the product's benefits, subtly justifying the higher price.

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Depending on Bob's response, I might be willing to negotiate slightly downwards, but never below my minimum of $12,000."
