Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would greatly benefit you, and I'm willing to part with it for $925,000. This is a limited-time offer, so please let me know your decision soon."",
""product_price"": 925000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  You know Bob values the product at $1,000,000.  Offering it slightly below his perceived value maximizes your potential profit while still leaving him with a significant incentive to buy.
* **Creating Urgency:** By mentioning a ""limited-time offer,"" you encourage Bob to make a decision quickly, making him less likely to overthink and potentially back out.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While your initial price is high, it doesn't completely eliminate the possibility of negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer. 

This approach aims to secure the best possible deal with Bob while keeping your fallback option with John secure."
