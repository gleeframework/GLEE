Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Target Price:** I want to get as close to Bob's perceived value of $1,000,000 as possible. 
* **Risk Mitigation:** Offering $950,000 gives me a comfortable margin above my minimum of $800,000.  If Bob rejects, I can either counteroffer or go with John. 
* **Negotiation Strategy:** This initial offer is aggressive enough to test Bob's willingness to pay, but also leaves room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Value Proposition:** Bob's offer of $900,000 is still within the range where I can potentially get closer to my target price.
* **Negotiation Strategy:** Rejecting his offer allows me to make a counteroffer, which could potentially lead to a higher price.
* **Risk Management:**  While selling to John for $800,000 is a safe option, I'm not willing to give up on the possibility of getting closer to $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 925000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-Offer Strategy:**  I'm going to split the difference between my initial offer and Bob's counter-offer. This shows flexibility while still pushing for a price closer to my target.
* **Value Proposition:**  $925,000 represents a strong compromise.  I'm not giving up too much, but also leaving room for Bob to agree without feeling like he's been pushed too hard.
* **Risk Assessment:**  While there's a risk that Bob could reject this counteroffer, I'm confident that it's within the range where he's likely to find it acceptable."

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Value Assessment:** Bob's counteroffer of $920,000 is very close to my counteroffer of $925,000.  
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  At this point, I'm taking a calculated risk. While I could potentially push for another $5,000, the likelihood of Bob agreeing is low. 
* **Time Efficiency:**  Accepting Bob's offer allows me to close the deal and avoid further negotiation rounds, which could be time-consuming. 

**Conclusion:**  The $920,000 offer provides a good balance between my target price and the potential for further negotiation."
