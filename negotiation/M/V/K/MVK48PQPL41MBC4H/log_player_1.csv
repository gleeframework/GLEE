"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the deal, but I think we can work something out closer to my valuation of the product. How about $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm aiming for a higher price than $85.  While $85 is better than selling to John, I'm going to try to push for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $85 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $90. This is a great price for you, considering the product's value to you. Let's close the deal at this price!"", ""product_price"": 90}
