"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

I'm starting with a price of $100.  This is a bit of a gamble, but I think it's a good starting point.  If Bob is interested, I'll make a profit. If he isn't, I can always lower the price or go with John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. $90 is a good price, and it's better than selling to John for $80. It's also a good starting point for further negotiations if Bob decides to counteroffer in the future."
