Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate the value of your product, $1,200,000 is significantly above my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it, which is still a considerable investment. This price reflects my maximum willingness to pay and should give you a good return on your asset.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.

This would be a win-win for both of us, allowing me to make a reasonable profit and you to acquire a powerful asset at a competitive price."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
