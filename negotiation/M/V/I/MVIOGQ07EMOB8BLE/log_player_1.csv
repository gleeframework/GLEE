Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's valued at over a million dollars to me, and I believe it will be equally valuable to you.  To start, I'm offering it to you for $1,100,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1100000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $900,000 is a significant amount, it's still below the product's value to me, and I have a potential buyer in John who will pay $1,000,000. I'll see if I can negotiate a better price with Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $900,000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to lower the price to $1,050,000. This represents a significant concession on my part, and I believe it's a fair price that benefits both of us. Let's find common ground and finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,050,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm ready to pay $950,000 for the product.  Let's meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob is getting closer to my minimum price, I'm still going to reject his offer. I'm hoping to get closer to my desired $1,000,000 and I'm not yet at a point where I feel I need to accept Bob's offer. I'll see if I can negotiate a better price in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to see we're getting closer. However, $950,000 is still a bit below what I need to accept.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1,000,000. This price is fair considering the value of the product, and it's also a significant discount from my initial offer. Let's close this deal and move forward."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
