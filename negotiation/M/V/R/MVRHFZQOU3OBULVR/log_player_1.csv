"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 170}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than what I know the product is worth to Bob. This is to see if he's willing to pay a premium. If he rejects, I can adjust my offer in the following rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I can get a better price from John. While $130 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum threshold of $150."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 160}
```

I'm counter-offering at $160. This is still above Bob's offer, but closer to his potential value. I'm hoping this will be enough to incentivize him to accept, but I'm also keeping in mind my minimum price of $150."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $135
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer again. While it's a slight improvement, it's still below my minimum threshold of $150. I can still get a better deal with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 155}
```

I'm lowering my price to $155. This is still a decent profit for me, and it's closer to Bob's maximum value.  I'm hoping this offer will be enticing enough for Bob to accept. I'm also aware that if he rejects this offer, I can still sell to John for $150 in the next round, which is still a good outcome for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm choosing to sell to John. While Bob's offer of $140 is closer to my minimum price, I'm still not willing to accept it. I can get a better price from John, and I don't want to risk going through more rounds of negotiation with Bob. I've already spent five rounds, and I don't want to risk losing a guaranteed $150 deal for the chance of getting a slightly higher price from Bob."
