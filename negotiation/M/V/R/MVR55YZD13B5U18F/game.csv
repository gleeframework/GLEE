"Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the value of the product, $1,000,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to offer $750,000. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but the $750,000 price point doesn't reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down slightly to $925,000. I believe this is a fair compromise.",925000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $925,000 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's split the difference and aim for $850,000.  This price would be a fair compromise for both of us.",850000.0,Bob,4,
