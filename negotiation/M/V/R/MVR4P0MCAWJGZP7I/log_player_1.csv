Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in the product, $1,400,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to offer $1,250,000 for it, which is a fair price considering its potential. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your perspective on the product's value, but $1,350,000 is still a bit outside my comfort zone.  I'm willing to go up to $1,300,000.  This demonstrates my genuine interest in acquiring the product while staying within my budget.  I believe this price reflects the potential benefits and is a fair compromise.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.
