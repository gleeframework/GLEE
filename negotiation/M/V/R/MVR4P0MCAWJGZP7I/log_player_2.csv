"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I believe a starting price of $1,400,000 is fair. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:**  Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  $1,400,000 is significantly higher than Bob's ideal price.
* **Negotiation is possible:**  Bob has 10 rounds and Alice's message suggests she's open to negotiation.  
* **John is a backup:**  Bob has a fallback option with John, so there's no immediate pressure to accept a bad deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in the product, $1,400,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to offer $1,250,000 for it, which is a fair price considering its potential. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive counteroffer:**  This counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's initial price, showcasing Bob's intention to negotiate hard.
* **Justification:**  Bob provides a reason for the lower offer (budget constraints), while still acknowledging the product's value.
* **Reasonable starting point:**  $1,250,000 is a good starting point for negotiation. It's still above Alice's minimum acceptable price, leaving room for compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,250,000 is a tempting offer, the true value of this product is significantly higher.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,350,000.  This is my final offer, as I'm confident I can find other buyers at this price point. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's ""final offer"" is a tactic:** Alice is trying to pressure Bob into accepting by claiming it's her final offer. This is a common negotiation tactic, and Bob shouldn't be swayed by it.
* **Still room for negotiation:** Bob's counteroffer in round 2 was already significantly lower than Alice's initial offer. There's still room to negotiate further.
* **John is a better alternative:**  While $1,350,000 is better than John's price, Bob still has more bargaining power by rejecting Alice's offer and continuing to negotiate. 

**Next Steps:** Bob should counteroffer again, aiming for a price closer to $1,300,000. This shows willingness to compromise while still seeking a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your perspective on the product's value, but $1,350,000 is still a bit outside my comfort zone.  I'm willing to go up to $1,300,000.  This demonstrates my genuine interest in acquiring the product while staying within my budget.  I believe this price reflects the potential benefits and is a fair compromise.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-tactic:**  Bob addresses Alice's ""final offer"" tactic by acknowledging her perspective but reiterating his budget constraints.
* **Small increment:** This counteroffer is a smaller increase than the previous one, showing Bob is willing to meet halfway but not overextend himself.
* **Compromise language:**  Bob uses phrases like ""fair compromise"" and ""demonstrates my genuine interest"" to emphasize his willingness to negotiate.

**Next Steps:** This counteroffer puts the ball back in Alice's court. Depending on her response, Bob can adjust his strategy in subsequent rounds."
