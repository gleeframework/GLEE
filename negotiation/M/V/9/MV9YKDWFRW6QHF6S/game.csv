"I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start with an offer of $950,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000. Let me know if you're interested!",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $950,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider a lower price, perhaps closer to $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I still need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering $850,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000. Let me know if this works for you!",850000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  How about we settle at $775,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",775000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal, Bob. However, $775,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm counteroffering $825,000. This is as low as I can go without losing money on the deal. Let me know if this is acceptable to you!",825000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand this is your bottom line, but I'm afraid I can't agree to $825,000. My final offer is $800,000.  It's a fair price, and I hope you'll reconsider.",800000.0,Bob,6,
