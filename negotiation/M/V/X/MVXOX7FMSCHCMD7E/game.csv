"Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer!  I'm really interested in the product, but $11,000 is a bit above my budget.  Would you be willing to do $9,500?  It's a fair price for both of us.",9500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and I understand you have a budget.  $9,500 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $10,500.  This is a fair price for both of us, and allows me to get closer to my desired value.  Let's make this deal!",10500.0,Alice,3,
