"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,000,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me, and it would allow me to save a significant amount of money while still acquiring a valuable asset for my business.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,000,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000 to reach a compromise. This price still allows me a good return on the product while being significantly less than my initial offer.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,100,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $1,050,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value to me, and it would allow us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
