"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. While I see its potential, $950,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to offer $850,000 for it.  I believe this is a fair price that allows both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $850,000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $900,000. This is a fair price that still reflects the value of the product, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to get a fantastic product at a competitive price.",900000.0,Alice,3,
