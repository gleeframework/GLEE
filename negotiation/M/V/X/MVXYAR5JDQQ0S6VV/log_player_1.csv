"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. I think it would be incredibly valuable to you. Given its features and benefits, I'm initially offering it for $22,000."", ""product_price"": 22000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $22,000 is way beyond what I'm able to spend. I'm really interested in this product, but my maximum budget is $8,000.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $8,000 is significantly below its true value.  I'm willing to be flexible, how about we meet halfway at $15,000?"", ""product_price"": 15000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $15,000 is still out of my price range.  I'm firm on my maximum budget of $8,000.  If you're not able to come down to that, I'm going to have to explore other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

Bob is clearly unwilling to budge from his $8,000 offer.  It's unlikely further negotiation will bridge the gap. Accepting his offer is a significant loss, and it's better to secure the guaranteed $15,000 from John."
