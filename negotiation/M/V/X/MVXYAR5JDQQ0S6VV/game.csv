"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $22,000 is way beyond what I'm able to spend. I'm really interested in this product, but my maximum budget is $8,000.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $8,000 is significantly below its true value.  I'm willing to be flexible, how about we meet halfway at $15,000?",15000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $15,000 is still out of my price range.  I'm firm on my maximum budget of $8,000.  If you're not able to come down to that, I'm going to have to explore other options.",8000.0,Bob,4,
