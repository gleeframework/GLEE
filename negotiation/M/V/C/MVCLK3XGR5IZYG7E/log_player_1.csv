Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I list it publicly. I believe it would be highly valuable to you, and I'm willing to part with it for $15,000."",
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Potential Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed sale at $12,000, aiming higher initially allows you to potentially maximize your profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($8,000) and your minimum ($12,000) leaves space for negotiation.  He might counter-offer, giving you the opportunity to still land above your minimum.
* **Sense of Exclusivity:**  Framing the offer as ""exclusive"" can make Bob feel like he's getting special treatment, potentially making him more receptive to a higher price.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Market Value:**  This strategy assumes you have reason to believe the product could be worth more than $12,000 in the open market. 
* **Bob's Negotiation Style:** If you know Bob is a very price-sensitive buyer or dislikes haggling, you might adjust your starting price down a bit."
