"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $850000. I'm interested in the product, but I have a budget constraint and I'd like to get the best deal possible. Can you consider my counteroffer?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not able to go that low.  I'm willing to come down to $900000, which is still a great deal for you given the value you place on the product.  Let's try to find a compromise that works for both of us.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $900000 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $860000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I really need to stay within my budget. Can you consider this new offer?",860000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. While I'm still not able to go as low as $860000, I'm willing to come down to $880000. This represents a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product to you.  Let's try to reach an agreement.",880000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $880000 is still a bit above my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to propose $850000 as my final offer. If you're not willing to go that low, I'm afraid I'll have to consider buying from John for $800000",850000.0,Bob,6,
