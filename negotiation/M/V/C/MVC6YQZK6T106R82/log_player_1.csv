Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I have a unique product I believe would be of great value to you. It's worth at least $1,500,000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,400,000. This is a substantial discount, and I'm confident it would be a worthwhile investment for your business. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  Offering $1,400,000 leaves some room for negotiation, potentially allowing Bob to feel like he's getting a better deal. 
* **Higher Than Bob's Value:** The price is still higher than Bob's perceived value of $800,000, but it's significantly lower than my minimum value of $1,500,000. This increases the likelihood of Bob accepting.
* **Potential for a Win-Win:** If Bob accepts, I make a profit of $100,000. If he rejects, I can sell to John for $1,500,000."
