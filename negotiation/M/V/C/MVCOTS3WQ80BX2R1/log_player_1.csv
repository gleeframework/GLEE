Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's valued at over $1.5 million to me, but I'm willing to start the negotiation at $1,200,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is a significant amount, it's still far below my minimum value of $1,500,000.  I'm confident I can negotiate a better price with Bob, or at least get closer to my desired range. I'm not in a rush to sell and have a backup option with John."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $950,000 is closer to my desired range, I'm still holding out for a better price. I have a safety net with John, who is willing to pay my full desired amount. I'm confident that with continued negotiation, I can either reach a better deal with Bob or gracefully move on to John."

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $950,000 is still a significant distance from where I need to be. Let's split the difference and try $1,000,000. I believe this price reflects the product's value while also being fair to both of us."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $975,000 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's meet in the middle at $987,500.

Round 8
Bob's offer:

Round 9
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I see we're getting closer! I'm willing to meet you halfway at $986,250. This price is a fair compromise and allows for a win-win scenario. Let's close this deal! "", ""product_price"": 986250}

Round 10
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your efforts to negotiate, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to pay $980,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can make a deal at this price.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is the final round of negotiations, and Bob's offer of $980,000 is still below my desired price range and my minimum value. It's time to cut my losses and sell to John for $1,500,000.  Even though I've invested time in negotiations with Bob, it's more beneficial to secure the guaranteed higher price from John."
