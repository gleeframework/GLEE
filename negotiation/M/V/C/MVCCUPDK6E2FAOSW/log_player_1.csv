"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in.  I'm asking for $12,000 for it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a high offer, but one that still leaves room for negotiation.  This maximizes my potential profit while still leaving Bob room to feel like he's getting a good deal.  I'm also being friendly and enthusiastic to encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit high for me.  Would you consider $8,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum desired price, and I'm confident I can get more. I'm going to reject his offer and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you making an offer, but $8,000 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,000, which is still a great deal for you considering the value of the product. Let's meet in the middle!"", ""product_price"": 10000} 
```

I'm counter-offering with $10,000, which is still a good deal for me and hopefully enticing enough for Bob to consider. I'm emphasizing the value of the product to encourage him to see it as a good investment."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you can't go as low as $8,000, Alice.  How about we split the difference and settle at $9,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,000 is closer to my desired price, it's still a bit low. I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can get closer to $10,000 in the next round.  I think there's still room for negotiation, and I don't want to settle too quickly."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. I'm still hoping to get closer to my asking price.  How about $9,500? It's a fair price for both of us and we can finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

I'm counter-offering with $9,500, which is a slight increase from Bob's last offer and demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while still staying close to my desired price. I'm framing it as a fair price for both of us to encourage Bob to see it as a win-win situation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $9,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to offer $9,200, which is a fair compromise.  Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $9,200 is very close to my desired price and a good deal for me.  I'm accepting his offer to finalize the deal."
