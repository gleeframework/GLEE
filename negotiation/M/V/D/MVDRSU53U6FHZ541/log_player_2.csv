# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000. I'm confident you'll love it!

Alice's offer:

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your desire to get closer to your target price, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $950,000. I'm willing to make one more concession. How about $1,025,000? This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000.

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go below $1,000,000.  It's in your best interest to cut your losses and buy from John for your maximum budget."
