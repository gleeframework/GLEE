"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $110.",110.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $110 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Can you meet me in the middle at $100?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $100. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $110 and $100, which would be $105. I think that's a fair price considering the value the product brings.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $105 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $95, but I'm not sure I can go any higher. Can you consider that?",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $95 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to compromise further. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $110 and $95, which would be $102.50. I think that's a fair price considering the value the product brings.",102.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $102.50 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $95 and $102.50, which would be $98.75. Can you consider that?",98.75,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're getting too close to the minimum price I'm willing to accept. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $110 and $98.75, which would be $104.375. I think that's a fair price considering the value the product brings.",104.375,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're concerned about the price, but I'm still not comfortable with $104.38. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $98.75 and $104.38, which would be $101.56. Can you consider that?",101.56,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to my minimum price, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $101.56. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $110 and $101.56, which would be $105.78. I think that's a fair price considering the value the product brings.",105.78,Alice,9,

"I understand that you're getting close to your minimum price, but I'm still not comfortable with $105.78. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $98.75 and $105.78, which would be $102.26. This is my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider buying the product from John for $120.",102.26,Bob,10,
