"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. I'm interested, but I'd be willing to pay $800,000 for it.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

I'm not willing to sell the product for $800,000. I believe it's worth more. I'll try to negotiate with Bob further to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. However, $800,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $1,100,000. This still leaves room for both of us to be satisfied. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me a little, but the gap is still too wide. To make this work, I'd need to see it closer to $900,000.  That's a serious offer, and I think it's a fair deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000

While $900,000 is closer to my desired price, I believe I can still do better. I'm going to try to negotiate further to see if I can get closer to my ideal price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $900,000 is still not quite there. How about $1,050,000? This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a reasonable profit for me. Let's work together to find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer. I can tell we're both motivated to make a deal. How about we split the difference and settle at $975,000? It's a win-win. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000

I'm still not convinced that $975,000 is the best price. I value the product at $1,000,000, and I'm willing to negotiate further to get closer to that figure."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
