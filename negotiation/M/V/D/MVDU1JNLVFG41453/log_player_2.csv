Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. However, $800,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $1,100,000. This still leaves room for both of us to be satisfied. Let me know what you think.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $900,000 is still not quite there. How about $1,050,000? This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a reasonable profit for me. Let's work together to find a middle ground.

Round 7
Alice's offer:

It's time to cut bait and go with John.  Alice is very unlikely to go below $1,000,000, and even if she did, the savings would be minimal. John offers a sure thing at your target price."
