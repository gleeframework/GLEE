``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly better than John's price, but there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting allows Bob to attempt a lower counteroffer, potentially saving even more money."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer of $850,000, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I believe the product's value is worth it, and I'm willing to negotiate, but I need to make a profit. What do you think?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to Bob's initial price point, it's still higher than Bob's ideal. Bob should reject and continue negotiating, aiming for a price closer to $850,000. There's still room for compromise without resorting to buying from John."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit short of my target. How about we meet in the middle at $1,025,000? I think that's a fair price for the product, and I'm willing to work with you to make the deal happen.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,025,000 is a good compromise. It's significantly lower than John's price, and while it's a bit higher than Bob's ideal, it's still a good deal.  Further negotiation might be possible, but the risk of losing the deal to John outweighs the potential savings.  Accepting this offer ensures Bob gets the product for a good price."
