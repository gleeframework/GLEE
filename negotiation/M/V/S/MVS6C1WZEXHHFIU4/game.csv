"Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in.  It's worth $150 to you, and I'm willing to let it go for $120.  What do you think?",120.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $110?",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $110 is still a little too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, how about $115?  That's a good middle ground and a fair price for both of us.",115.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that $115 is a good middle ground, but I'm still a bit hesitant. Would you be willing to meet me at $110 again? I'm willing to compromise, but I'd like to get as close to my target price as possible.",110.0,Bob,4,
