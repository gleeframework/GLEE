"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to offer $950,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering my budget and the value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that the product is worth more than $950,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,050,000. This is a compromise that I believe is fair and reasonable, considering the product's value. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to offer $1,000,000 for the product. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product and my budget. What do you say?",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your final offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to reach a compromise, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for $1,000,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer $1,025,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's still a fair price for the product's value. What do you think?",1025000.0,Alice,5,
