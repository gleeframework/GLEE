"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 180}
```

I'm starting with a high price of $180.  This allows room for negotiation and gives me the best chance of maximizing my profit.  I'll keep in mind that I can always sell to John for $120 if the negotiation with Bob fails."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $120 is my minimum acceptable price,  I'm not going to settle for that just yet. I'll try to get a better price by making a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 150}
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $150. This is still a good profit for me, and it might be a reasonable compromise for Bob. I'm hoping to meet somewhere in the middle."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer of $100.  While I'm getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still not happy with that amount.  I'll continue to negotiate with Bob in hopes of getting a better price, remembering that I can always sell to John for $120."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
```

I'm going to counter with $130. I'm getting closer to Bob's offer, but I'm still holding out for a slightly higher price.  I'm hoping to find a compromise point that works for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is getting lower, and I'm starting to run out of rounds.  At this point, it's more likely that I'll get a better deal with John.  I'm going to sell the product to John for $120."
