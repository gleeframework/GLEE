```

I'm offering the product to Bob for $140. This is a fair price, considering it's worth $150 to him and $120 to me.  I'm confident we can reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json

While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, $130 is still a good profit. It's better than selling to John for $120, and there's no guarantee I'll get a better offer in future rounds."
