"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it has immense value and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start the negotiation with an offer of $800,000. I think this is a fair starting point, considering the product's worth to you.",800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $800,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'd be willing to pay $650,000 for the product.  I believe this price reflects the value to me and gives us both a solid starting point for further discussion.",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $650,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $725,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",725000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $725,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with at the moment.  I'm willing to go up to $700,000. This price reflects a significant compromise on my part and I believe it's a fair offer that allows us to move forward with the sale.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $750,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and it's getting close to the original price I had in mind.",750000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're holding firm on the price, but $750,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $720,000, which is a significant compromise on my part.  This price is a good midpoint between our last two offers and allows us to make progress toward a mutually agreeable deal.",720000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $720,000. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer and meet you at $740,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",740000.0,Alice,7,
