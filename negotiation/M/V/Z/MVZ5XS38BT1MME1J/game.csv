"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the price of $850000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $750000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $750000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $800000. It's a great price, and I think it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",800000.0,Alice,3,
