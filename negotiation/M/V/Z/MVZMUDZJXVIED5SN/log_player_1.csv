Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds immense value, and I'm confident it's worth $1,500,000 to you in the long run. To give you a head start, I'm willing to make a deal at $1,250,000. This is a time-sensitive offer, so I encourage you to act swiftly."", ""product_price"": 1250000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Anchor:** Starting with a price of $1,500,000 sets a high anchor, making the final offer seem like a better deal. 
* **Value Justification:** Emphasizing the product's long-term worth to Bob helps justify the high price.
* **Urgency:**  Adding a time constraint encourages Bob to make a decision quickly and potentially avoid missing out. 
* **Backup Plan:** You have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,000,000, so any amount Bob agrees to above that is profit.

This strategy aims to secure the highest possible price from Bob while still leaving room for negotiation."
