Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I know it's something you're interested in and would be a valuable asset to you. I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000.  This is a fair price considering its value proposition and potential ROI for you. "", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  Bob values the product at $1,500,000. Offering it at $1,400,000 allows Alice to capture a significant portion of the potential profit while still leaving Bob with a perceived gain ($100,000). 
* **Alternative Buyer:**  Knowing John provides a safety net at $1,200,000, Alice can confidently aim higher with Bob.
* **First Offer Psychology:**  A strong initial offer can set the tone for the negotiation. It shows Alice is serious but also leaves room for potential adjustments if Bob counters."
