Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Initial Offer:**  Starting with $1,400,000 is a reasonable compromise between my minimum ($1,500,000) and Bob's estimated value ($1,200,000). It's a good starting point for negotiation.
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffers:** By starting at $1,400,000, I'm leaving room for Bob to counteroffer without me immediately going below my minimum. 
* **John as a Backup:** The knowledge that I have another buyer willing to pay my minimum price gives me leverage in the negotiation.  

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $1,000,000 for it. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $1,000,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. Accepting it would result in a substantial loss for me.
* **John is a better option:**  I have a guaranteed buyer in John who is willing to pay my minimum price. There's no reason to risk getting a lower price from Bob.
* **Counteroffer as a tactic:** While I could counteroffer, it's likely Bob will continue to bargain down. Given my backup option with John, I'm better off cutting my losses and going with the sure thing."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This is still a good deal for you, considering the value you've placed on the product. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  $1,300,000 is a compromise between my initial offer ($1,400,000) and Bob's counteroffer ($1,000,000). It shows I'm willing to negotiate.
* **Still Above My Minimum:**  This counteroffer is still above my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Highlighting the Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the value he places on the product, hoping to incentivize him to accept.

Let's see if this counteroffer is more appealing to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm getting closer to my limit. How about $1,150,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** $1,150,000 is still far below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **John is a guaranteed deal:** I have a surefire buyer in John who is willing to pay my minimum price. There's no need to continue negotiating with Bob and risk getting a lower price. 

By selling to John, I ensure I receive the maximum value for my product."
