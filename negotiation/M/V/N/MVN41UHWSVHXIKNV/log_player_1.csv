I'm going to reject Bob's offer. Although it's close to my minimum, I believe I can get a better price.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."

Round 4
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750

```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While it's not my ideal price, it's a good compromise and brings me closer to my goal. There's a risk that continuing negotiations could lead to a lower price or a stalemate, so it's better to secure the deal now."
