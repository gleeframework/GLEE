"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this truly unique product.  Given its value and potential, I'm initially suggesting a price of $1,500,000.  I'm confident this is a fair starting point for our discussion.",1500000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,500,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $900,000 significantly undervalues this product and its potential. To move forward, I could consider $1,300,000. This feels like a fair compromise.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $1,300,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000. This would be a fair compromise for both of us, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
