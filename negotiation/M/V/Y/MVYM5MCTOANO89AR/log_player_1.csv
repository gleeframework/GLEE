Even though the offers are getting lower, we're still significantly above John's offer.  Bob is showing he's willing to negotiate, but we need to hold firm to get a better price."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm trying to be fair with my pricing here.  $120 is my final offer - I need to be able to cover my costs."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you need to cover your costs, but I'm still a bit hesitant at $120. How about we try $110? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{

}
```

It's getting risky to push further. Bob is unlikely to go much higher, and we're still getting a good deal at $110, which is significantly more than John's $80 offer."
