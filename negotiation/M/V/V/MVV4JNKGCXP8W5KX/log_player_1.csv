Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a fantastic deal, and I believe it's worth every penny. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting with a price of $1,200,000, which is 20% above my minimum value. This leaves room for negotiation but still offers a good profit margin.
* **Message:**  I'm keeping the message friendly and positive, emphasizing the value of the product. This helps build rapport and encourages Bob to consider the offer seriously.

**Strategy:**

* **Start high:** This sets the initial negotiation point in my favor.
* **Be prepared to negotiate:**  I'm ready to adjust my price if necessary but I won't accept anything below my minimum value.
* **Have a backup plan:**  The option to sell to John for $1,000,000 provides a safety net if the negotiation with Bob fails."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to save as much as possible. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. I think it's a fair price considering it's worth $1,000,000 to you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum value:**  $900,000 is less than my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  Accepting this offer would result in a loss for me.
* **Opportunity for negotiation:**  Even though Bob's offer is low, it indicates his willingness to negotiate.  I can try to bridge the gap with a counteroffer in the next round.
* **John is a guaranteed option:**  Selling to John for $1,000,000 is still a viable option if negotiations with Bob continue to fail.

**Next Steps:**

I will reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer in the next round.  I will aim for a price that is closer to my desired range while still leaving room for potential compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to be flexible.  However, $900,000 is simply too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,050,000?  This would still be a great price for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm offering $1,050,000, which is halfway between my minimum acceptable price ($1,000,000) and Bob's offer ($900,000). 
* **Message:** I'm using a conciliatory tone, acknowledging Bob's desire for a good deal while emphasizing the value of the product. I'm framing the counteroffer as a ""meeting in the middle"" to encourage a compromise.

**Strategy:**

* **Bridge the gap:** My counteroffer shows I'm willing to negotiate, but it still ensures I receive a reasonable price.
* **Maintain leverage:**  I'm not giving in completely to Bob's offer, as I still have the option of selling to John.
* **Keep the communication positive:** A friendly tone can encourage further negotiation and potentially lead to a mutually agreeable outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but I'm still looking to save as much as possible. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. I think it's a fair price considering it's worth $1,000,000 to you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:** $950,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  
* **Negotiation is becoming unproductive:** The negotiation has reached a point where further back-and-forth is unlikely to lead to a significantly better offer from Bob. 
* **Guaranteed profit with John:**  Selling to John for $1,000,000 guarantees my minimum desired profit. 

**Strategy:**

While I'm open to negotiation, I need to prioritize maximizing my earnings.  Selling to John eliminates any risk of a further price reduction from Bob and ensures I get the best possible outcome at this point in the negotiation."
