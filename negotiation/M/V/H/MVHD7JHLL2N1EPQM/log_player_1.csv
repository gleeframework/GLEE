I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value, hoping to get a good starting point in the negotiation. If he rejects, I'll be prepared to negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While it's close to my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price by continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500}
```

I'm going to counter with $12,500. This is still a bit higher than Bob's offer, but it's closer to my minimum acceptable price and hopefully will lead to a successful negotiation."

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,200

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While it's only slightly above my minimum, it's a better deal than selling to John and it avoids further rounds of negotiation."
