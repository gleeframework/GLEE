"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $950000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal anywhere else.",950000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but $950000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $850000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm afraid $850000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. I can do $875000, and that's as low as I'm willing to go. What do you think?",875000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $875000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $825000 for the product. Can you consider that price?",825000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $825000 is still a bit below my target price, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I can do $850000, and that's my final offer. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm ready to make a deal. If not, I'll have to consider other options.",850000.0,Alice,5,

"I've already offered $825000, and I'm not willing to go any higher. I'd like to buy the product for that price. Is that a deal?",825000.0,Bob,6,
