Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $120 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $90. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our original offer and your counteroffer.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $80 is a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm not willing to sell the product for that low. I'm willing to make a small concession, but I need to make sure I get a fair price for my product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $95. It's a good compromise between our previous offers.
