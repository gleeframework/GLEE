{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $120. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very useful. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than what I know the product is worth to Bob, but still lower than my minimum acceptable price. This allows for some room for negotiation.  I'm also trying to build a positive rapport by highlighting the value of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am only able to pay up to $90 for it. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price of $100.  While it's tempting to take the $90, I'm going to hold out for a better price. I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price by counter-offering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your interest.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $90 is simply too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $105? I think that's a fair price considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your response. While I understand the value of the product, I'm unable to meet the price of $105. Would you consider going down to $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $100 is my minimum acceptable price.  While I'd prefer to get more, it's better to close the deal at this point than risk losing the sale completely."
