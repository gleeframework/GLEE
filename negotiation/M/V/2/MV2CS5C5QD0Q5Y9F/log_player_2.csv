Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,000 is just too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $8,500?  That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure you'll agree this product is worth it.

Round 5

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $8,000 is still a little low for me. Let's split the difference at $8,100. This feels like a fair compromise, and it allows us to both get what we need out of this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,100

Alice is unlikely to go below $8,100.  You can get the same product from John for $8,000, so it makes sense to cut your losses and go with the guaranteed lower price."
