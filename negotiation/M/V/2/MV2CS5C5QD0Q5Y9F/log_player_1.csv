"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I know you'll love!  I'm asking for $9,000 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $9,000, which is a little more than Bob's perceived value, but it gives me room to negotiate.
* **Friendly Tone:**  I'm keeping the message friendly and positive to build rapport and encourage Bob to consider the offer. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** This offer leaves room for negotiation, which is essential in a back-and-forth scenario."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. Would you consider $7,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $7,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum desired price of $10,000. I'm confident I can do better by continuing to negotiate with Bob.  I'll counter his offer in the next round, aiming to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,000 is just too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $8,500?  That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure you'll agree this product is worth it."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a compromise by suggesting a price halfway between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. 
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value, emphasizing the fairness of the proposed price.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm keeping the tone positive to maintain a collaborative atmosphere."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're looking for a higher price, Alice, and I appreciate you meeting me a bit. How about $7,750? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Although Bob is showing a willingness to negotiate and has moved slightly closer to my desired price, $7,750 is still too far below my minimum of $10,000.  I believe I can push for a higher price, and I'm confident I can get closer to my goal in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm willing to negotiate, but $7,750 is still too far off.  Let's try $8,250.  It's a good compromise, and we can both walk away feeling like we got a good deal."", ""product_price"": 8250}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Staying Firm:** I'm holding my ground and not accepting a price that's too low for me. 
* **Incremental Increase:** I'm raising the price incrementally, showing that I'm willing to compromise but also that I believe the product is worth more.
* **Positive Framing:** I'm framing the offer as a ""good compromise"" to make it more appealing to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm trying to make this work but I need to stay closer to my budget. Would you do it for $8,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $8,000 is getting closer to my minimum price, I'm still not satisfied. I believe I can push a little further and get a slightly better deal.  I'll counter with a slightly higher price in the next round.  If Bob rejects again, I'm starting to get close to the point where I might consider selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $8,000 is still a little low for me. Let's split the difference at $8,100. This feels like a fair compromise, and it allows us to both get what we need out of this deal."", ""product_price"": 8100}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise Focus:** I emphasize that this is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway from his last offer.
* **Fairness Appeal:** I reiterate the fairness of the offer, highlighting the mutual benefit of the deal.
* **Final Push:**  I'm making one final push for a price that's closer to my minimum while still being potentially acceptable to Bob. 

**Reasoning:**

If Bob rejects this offer, I'm getting close to my breaking point. I'm starting to consider selling to John for $10,000. However, I still believe there's a chance I can get a slightly better deal with Bob. This counteroffer is a final attempt to secure a price closer to my minimum while keeping the negotiation open."
