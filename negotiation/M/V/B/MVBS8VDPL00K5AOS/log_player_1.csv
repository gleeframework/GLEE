{""product_price"": 15000}

I'm offering the product to Bob for $15,000. This price is higher than what I'd get from John, giving me the opportunity to maximize my profit.  Since I don't know Bob's valuation of the product, I'm taking a calculated risk. If Bob accepts, I'll make a good profit. If he rejects, I still have John as a backup buyer, ensuring I don't lose out entirely."
