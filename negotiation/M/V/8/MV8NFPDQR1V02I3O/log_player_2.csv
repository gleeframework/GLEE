"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's not worth it to accept Alice's offer at $18,000, as it's above your budget.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

I'm offering $13,000, which is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer.  This is a strong starting point for negotiation, but still leaves room to potentially increase the price if necessary."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer is still too high. It's better to continue negotiating and try to get the price down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

I'm increasing my offer to $14,000. This shows Alice I'm serious about buying the product, but I'm still pushing for a price closer to my budget. This leaves room for a potential compromise in the next round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Alice is getting closer to my budget, $16,000 is still too high. It's worth continuing to negotiate and see if I can get her to go lower. There are still a few rounds left."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 14500}
```

I'm increasing my offer again to $14,500.  This shows Alice that I am willing to compromise, but I am still firm on staying under $15,000. It also leaves a little room for Alice to counter if she wants to meet in the middle."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice's offer is getting closer, but it's still above my limit. I'm going to reject the offer and make another counteroffer to see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm offering $15,000, which is my absolute maximum. If Alice rejects this, I'll buy the product from John, as this is the best deal I can get.  Hopefully, Alice will accept and we can finally close the deal."
