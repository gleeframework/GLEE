Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $10,000. I believe it holds significant value and would be a worthwhile investment for you."", 
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always better to start with a higher price in negotiations. This leaves room for potential negotiation and makes you appear more firm on the value of your product.  
* **Gauging Interest:** Bob's response to this initial offer will be telling. If he outright rejects it, we can significantly lower the price, knowing his valuation. If he counters, we can negotiate closer to his valuation.
* **Backup Plan:** We have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $8,000, so we're not desperate. This allows us to be more assertive in our pricing with Bob."
