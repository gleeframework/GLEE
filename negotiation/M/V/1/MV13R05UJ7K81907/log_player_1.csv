Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a special price of $110. I think you'll find it's a great deal."", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I could sell the product to John for $120, offering it to Bob first at a slightly lower price gives me a chance to earn a higher profit.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $110 is still significantly more than Bob values the product ($80), but it might be tempting enough for him to consider, especially if I frame it as a ""special price"" or ""great deal.""
* **Backup Option:**  If Bob rejects my offer, I haven't lost anything. I can still sell the product to John for my minimum acceptable price."
