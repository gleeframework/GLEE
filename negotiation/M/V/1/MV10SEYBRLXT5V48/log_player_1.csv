"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
``` 
 
I'm starting with my minimum price, as I know I can sell it to John for that amount. Let's see if Bob is willing to pay my price!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $105 is better than Bob's initial offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to counteroffer and try to get closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 115}
```

I'm going to counter with $115.  It's a compromise, halfway between my initial offer and Bob's last offer.  Hopefully, we can reach an agreement within the remaining rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob has moved closer to my desired price.  While I would prefer $115, accepting his $110 offer is still a good outcome, given the remaining rounds. It's a better deal than selling to John and saves me the time of negotiating further."
