{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I think would be of great value to you. It's something you've been looking for and I believe it's worth $15,000 to you. I'm willing to let it go for $12,500. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above your minimum:** $12,500 is well above your minimum of $10,000. 
* **It's below Bob's perceived value:** $12,500 is still less than what Bob thinks the product is worth. This gives him incentive to negotiate.
* **It shows you're willing to negotiate:** By offering a lower price than Bob's perceived value, you're showing you're open to discussing the price.

By starting with this offer, you create an opportunity for negotiation that can potentially lead to a final price that benefits both of you."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested, but $12,500 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $10,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is at your minimum, you can likely do better.  You've already shown your willingness to negotiate, and Bob has demonstrated he wants the product. You're in a good position to push for a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I understand $10,000 is your preferred price, I'm still hoping for a bit more to make this deal work for me.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $11,250? It's a fair compromise that gives us both a good deal."", ""product_price"": 11250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  How about we split the difference again and settle at $10,625? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,625. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,625
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

At this point, you've already rejected Bob's offer of $10,000 and countered with $11,250.  While you might be able to squeeze out a few more dollars with another round of negotiation, it's likely that Bob is firm on his price.  Accepting his offer of $10,625 is a reasonable compromise. It's significantly more than your minimum of $10,000 and gets you closer to your desired price without risking a stalemate."
