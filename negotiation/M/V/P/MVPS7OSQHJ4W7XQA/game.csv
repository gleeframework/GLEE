"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,000,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  It's a fair price considering my budget and the value of the product to me.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 is too far below my asking price. I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This is a significant concession, and it reflects the value I see in your potential as a customer.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the compromise, but $950,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $900,000.  This is a fair price, considering my budget and the value of the product to me. I'm confident we can reach an agreement that benefits both of us.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $900,000 is still a little too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $975,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the potential for a mutually beneficial partnership. I believe this offer demonstrates my commitment to reaching a deal that works for both of us.",975000.0,Alice,5,
