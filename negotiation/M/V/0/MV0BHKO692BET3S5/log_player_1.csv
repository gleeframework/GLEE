""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. However,  $2,300,000 is really my bottom line. To help us find a compromise, I'm willing to come down slightly to $2,100,000. I believe this reflects the true value of the product while acknowledging your offer."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the compromise, but I'm still a bit concerned about the price. Would you be willing to consider $1,700,000? I think this is a fair price that reflects the product's value and my budget.

**Reasoning:** Bob is moving closer to my acceptable range, but I'm still well above my minimum. I'll continue negotiating to see if I can push the price higher."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. I'm willing to meet you at $1,800,000, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,800,000 - $1,850,000. Would you be willing to consider $1,825,000? I think this is a fair price that reflects the product's value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  While I could try to push for a bit more, Bob has steadily increased his offer and is now quite close to my $1.95M counter. Accepting at $1.825M gives me a significant profit over my guaranteed $1.5M from John. It's time to close the deal."
