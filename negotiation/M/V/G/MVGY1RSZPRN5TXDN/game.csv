"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I really appreciate it. However, $120 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $85 for it. What do you think?",85.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $120 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $85. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $105. What do you think?",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $105 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $95. That's a fair price for both of us, and it's within my budget.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! However, I'm not willing to go as low as $95. I'm willing to compromise and offer it to you for $110. It's a fair price that's closer to my minimum price, but still a good deal for you.",110.0,Alice,5,
