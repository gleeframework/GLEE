{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $13,500. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 13500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's significantly less than my minimum price of $15,000, but still high enough to be potentially attractive to Bob since it's less than what he's willing to pay. This leaves room for negotiation, and also allows me to see if Bob is serious about buying the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too high for me. Would you consider $10,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

Bob's offer is far too low. It's much lower than my minimum price of $15,000. I'm not willing to sell the product for that amount, but I also want to see if I can negotiate a better price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get at least $12,000 for this product.  Would you be willing to go up to $12,000?  That's still a good price for you, and it's closer to what I need."", ""product_price"": 12000}
