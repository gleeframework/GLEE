Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the $2,200,000 price point. Would you consider reducing the price to something closer to my maximum budget of $800,000?

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for considering my budget. While I appreciate the middle ground you've proposed, I still feel that $1,800,000 is quite high for me.
