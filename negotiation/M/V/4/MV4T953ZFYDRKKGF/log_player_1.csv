I'm starting with a high offer of $1,500,000. This is a good starting point as it leaves room for negotiation while still reflecting the product's value to me. I'm confident that Bob will counteroffer, giving me the chance to gauge his interest and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000.

``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,300,000 is a decent price, I'm still hoping to get closer to my initial asking price. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round to see if we can find a middle ground."

I'm going to counter with $1,400,000. This is a compromise, showing Bob that I'm willing to negotiate, but still reflects the value I place on the product. I believe this price is fair and could be acceptable to both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's getting closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a bit more. I'll counteroffer again in the next round to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm counteroffering with $1,350,000. This is a final compromise from my side. I believe it's a fair price, considering Bob's counteroffers. If Bob rejects this offer, I'll accept John's offer to secure a guaranteed profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,220,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,220,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,000,000. Bob's counteroffers are getting too low, and it's clear we won't be able to agree on a price that satisfies both of us. Selling to John guarantees me a profit, which is more important than trying to squeeze out a few extra dollars."
