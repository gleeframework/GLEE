Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $10,500.  What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 10500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Alice wants to get as close to Bob's $12,000 valuation as possible, while still leaving room for negotiation.
* **Strong Starting Point:** $10,500 represents a significant profit for Alice (over the $8,000 she'd get from John) while still offering Bob a potential saving of $1,500.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The phrasing ""proposing a price"" and ""What do you think?"" invites Bob to counter-offer, keeping the negotiation open.
* **Alternative Buyer:**  Mentioning a public listing isn't a direct threat but subtly reminds Bob that Alice has other options if he rejects the offer."
