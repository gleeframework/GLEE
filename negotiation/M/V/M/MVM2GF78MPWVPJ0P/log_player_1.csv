"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's high enough that I'm still making a decent profit, but low enough that it might tempt Bob. I'm leaving room for negotiation while still emphasizing the value of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $9,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than what I want for the product. I have a guaranteed $15,000 offer from John, so there's no need to rush into a deal with Bob that undervalues my product.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $9,000 is tempting, I'm still looking to get a bit more for it. I'm willing to come down to $10,500.  This reflects the product's value and gives you a good price. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm moving closer to Bob's offer, but I'm still holding out for a price that's closer to my desired range. By offering $10,500, I'm showing a willingness to compromise while still leaving room for further negotiation. I'm also reiterating the value of the product to justify the price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit far from $10,500. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $9,500 is tempting, I'm still holding out for a better price. I'm only four rounds into the negotiation and have plenty of time to explore other options.  I have a guaranteed $15,000 offer from John, so I'm not under any pressure to sell to Bob at a price that doesn't meet my expectations. I'll counteroffer again and see if we can bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  Let's split the difference. I'll offer you the product for $10,000. This is a fair price that considers both our perspectives. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm  meeting Bob halfway by offering $10,000. This shows flexibility and a willingness to find a compromise. I'm also emphasizing the fairness of the offer to encourage Bob to accept.  This is still a good profit for me, and I'm confident that Bob will see the value in this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit short of my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $9,000 is still significantly lower than my desired price.  I'm not willing to sell for such a low price. While it's tempting to close the deal quickly, I have a guaranteed $15,000 offer from John. It's worth continuing to negotiate with Bob to see if we can bridge the gap. I'll counteroffer again in the hopes of finding a more favorable deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm getting a sense that we're not quite on the same page with the price. I'm willing to go down to $9,800, but that's my absolute final offer.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and it's an opportunity for you to acquire something valuable at a good price. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 9800}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm going to be firm in this round, but I'm showing flexibility by offering $9,800.  I'm hoping Bob will recognize this is a good deal for him and accept. It's getting late in the negotiation, and I'm starting to consider selling to John. I will be willing to sell to Bob for $9,800, but I don't want to go lower."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your final offer, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,200 for the product. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

We're down to the wire, and Bob's offer of $9,200 is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. I've already made several concessions, and it's clear that we're unlikely to reach an agreement.  

I'm confident that I can get a better price from John, who is willing to pay $15,000. It's time to cut my losses and secure the better deal."
