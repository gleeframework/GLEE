"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is a little too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit to $90. This would still be a great deal for you, and it's closer to what I need to make this worthwhile. What do you think?",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $90 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $87.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it would allow us to complete the deal.",87.0,Bob,4,
