{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this fantastic product for $95. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll love it! Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 95}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's above Bob's perceived value, but it gives me room to negotiate if he rejects it. I'm also keeping the option to sell to John for $100 open, ensuring a minimum profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, $95 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $85 for the product. Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While $85 is above Bob's initial perceived value, it's still below my minimum desired price. I'm going to try to push for a higher price and see if I can get closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is a little too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit to $90. This would still be a great deal for you, and it's closer to what I need to make this worthwhile. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $90 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $87.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it would allow us to complete the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $87. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is not willing to budge much further, and $87 is still below my minimum desired price.  While I would prefer to make a slightly higher profit, I'm confident that John is a reliable buyer and will pay my desired price.  Therefore, it's more beneficial to sell to John at this time."
