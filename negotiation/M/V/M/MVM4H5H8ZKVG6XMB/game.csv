"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,200,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations, and I'm open to discussing it further.",2200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice,  $2,200,000 is well above my budget. I'm very interested in the product, but I can only go up to $1,200,000 at this point. Let's see if we can find some common ground.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand your budget constraints. However,  $1,200,000 significantly undervalues the true potential of this product.  To find a compromise, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. I believe this price reflects the value you'll gain while acknowledging your interest.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you value the product highly, but $1,900,000 is still out of my range.  I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000. This is a significant jump from my previous offer, showing my commitment to making this deal work. Let's find a middle ground.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I've considered your latest offer carefully, and to be completely transparent,  $1,500,000 is the absolute lowest I can go.  This price represents a significant compromise on my end, but I value the potential of this deal and your commitment to finding a solution.",1500000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  I'm very close to my limit, but I can offer $1,450,000. This is a serious offer, and I'm hoping we can close the deal.  If this isn't acceptable, I might have to explore other options.",1450000.0,Bob,6,
