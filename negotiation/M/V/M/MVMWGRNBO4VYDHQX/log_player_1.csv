Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm confident it will be worth at least $10,000 to you. To make this a smooth transaction, I'm offering it to you for $14,000. What do you say?"", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  My goal is to get the highest price possible. Since I have a guaranteed buyer at $10,000 (John), I can aim higher with Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $14,000 leaves room for negotiation while still aiming for a significant profit margin. 
* **Value Emphasis:** Highlighting the product's value to Bob might make him more amenable to a higher price. 
* **Clear and Direct:**  The message is straightforward and avoids unnecessary complexity.

This strategy balances risk and reward. If Bob accepts, I make a great deal. If he rejects it, I can still sell to John at my minimum acceptable price."
