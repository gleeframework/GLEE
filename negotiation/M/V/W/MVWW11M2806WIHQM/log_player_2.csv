"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  He can do better.  While $11,500 is a good price, he can likely get it lower.  He should counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $11,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This would still be a great deal for you, considering the product's value. Let's find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob should accept Alice's offer. At $11,000, he is getting a good deal, and it's still cheaper than buying from John. There's no guarantee he can get a better price in the next round, and he risks losing the opportunity to buy from Alice altogether."
