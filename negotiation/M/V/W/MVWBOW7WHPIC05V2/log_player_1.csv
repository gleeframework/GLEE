Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $14,999. I know it's valuable to you and I'm hoping this offer is agreeable."", 
""product_price"": 14999
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to $15,000 as possible. Offering it just below this price maximizes potential profit from Bob.
* **Urgency:**  The message implies that this is a special opportunity for Bob, subtly encouraging him to act quickly.
* **Alternative Buyer:** While Alice has John as a backup, there's no guarantee of a smoother sale or potential delays.  Getting Bob to accept is the fastest route to profit."
