Alice's offer is too high. Bob should reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1300000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1,300,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This reflects the value of the product and gives us both a fair deal. Let's close this deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000

Alice's offer of $1,350,000 is within Bob's budget and is a better deal than buying from John for $1,200,000.  It's worth accepting to secure the product."
