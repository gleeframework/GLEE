Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the value it brings.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:** This gives Bob some room to negotiate and feel like he's getting a good deal. 
* **It's below your minimum:** This ensures you're still getting more than your minimum price.
* **It leaves room for counteroffers:**  This allows the negotiation to flow and potentially reach a mutually agreeable price. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is closer to our minimum, it's still below our ideal price. We can try to squeeze a little more out of the negotiation before resorting to selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,300,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This reflects the value of the product and gives us both a fair deal. Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```

This counteroffer is designed to:

* **Show flexibility:**  It demonstrates that we're willing to compromise.
* **Stay above our minimum:** We're still getting more than our minimum acceptable price.
* **Keep the negotiation moving:**  It increases the chances of a successful deal without giving away too much."
