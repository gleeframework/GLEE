Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $145. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price."",
""product_price"": 145
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $150, your goal is to see if Bob will pay more. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product slightly below your guaranteed price creates a sense of urgency and value for Bob. It's unlikely he'll pay significantly more than his perceived value of $100.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While this offer is firm, the message implies there might be a deal to be made, leaving a small window open if Bob wants to counter-offer."
