"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for considering purchasing our product. We're excited to discuss the details with you. As a starting point, we're willing to offer you the product for $900000. We believe this is a competitive price considering the product's value and your needs. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is significantly lower than what Bob is willing to pay.  It makes sense to reject the offer and try to negotiate a better price.  There are still 9 rounds remaining, and Bob has a strong position as he can always buy from John for a known price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the gesture, $900,000 is a bit lower than I'm able to go at this time.  I'm willing to offer $1,000,000 for the product. This price reflects the value I place on the product, and I believe it's a fair starting point for further discussion."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. We appreciate your willingness to negotiate. After careful consideration, we're willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $950000. We believe this price still reflects the value of the product, and we're open to further discussion to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved slightly closer to Bob's desired price, but it's still below Bob's target. It's worth continuing to negotiate as there are still plenty of rounds left, and Bob has the option of buying from John as a fallback."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  While $950,000 is closer, it's still not quite where I need to be.  I'm prepared to offer $1,050,000 for the product.  This is a significant step from my previous offer, and I believe it reflects a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. We appreciate your willingness to move closer to our target price. After careful consideration, we're willing to offer the product for $1030000. We believe this price still reflects the value of the product, and we're open to further discussion to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,030,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,030,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to Bob's desired price. While Bob could continue negotiating, it's becoming a bit risky.  He's already made several counteroffers and is approaching the halfway point in the negotiation rounds. Accepting the offer at $1,030,000 saves Bob a significant amount of money compared to buying from John, and it ensures a deal is reached without further risk."
