Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the gesture, $900000 is a bit lower than I'm able to go at this time.  I'm willing to offer $1000000 for the product. This price reflects the value I place on the product, and I believe it's a fair starting point for further discussion.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
