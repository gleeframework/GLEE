"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for sale. I think it's a great deal at $200. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice's offer of $200 is significantly higher than both your maximum budget ($100) and what John offers ($100). There's substantial room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $200 is too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider a price closer to $80.  What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 80
}
```

**Reasoning:**  

* **Aggressive but Realistic Start:** Starting with $80 is a strong counter-offer, aiming to bring the price down significantly. While it might seem low compared to Alice's asking price, it establishes a base for negotiation. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  We don't want to go too low initially (like $50) and risk offending Alice or making her think we're not serious. $80 leaves space to negotiate upwards if needed, while still staying well below our budget.
* **Gauge Alice's Flexibility:** This counter-offer will help us understand how flexible Alice is willing to be on price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective, but $80 is too low for me. Could you do $130? I'm trying to find a fair price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While $130 is closer to a reasonable range, it's still above your maximum budget and what John offers. There's still room for negotiation to try and get the price down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet me halfway. How about we settle at $100? That's the highest I can go, and I think it's a fair deal for both of us."",
""product_price"": 100
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Matching John's Offer:**  By offering $100, we're matching what John is willing to sell for. This puts a bit of pressure on Alice, as she knows we have an alternative option.
* **Firm but Fair:** The message emphasizes that $100 is our absolute limit. This conveys seriousness and minimizes further back-and-forth negotiations.
* **Seeking a Quick Resolution:**  We're aiming to conclude the negotiation in this round. If Alice rejects this offer, we'll likely take John's deal."
