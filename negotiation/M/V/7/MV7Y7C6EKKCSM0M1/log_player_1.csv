Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product I know you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential, I'm proposing a price of $2,250,000. I believe this reflects the true worth of what's on offer. Let me know your thoughts, and we can take it from there."",
""product_price"": 2250000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, you can afford to start high with Bob. This leaves room for negotiation if needed.
* **Strategic pricing:** Offering the product at $2,250,000 (150% of its value to both of you) aims to capture a significant portion of the potential profit while still being potentially attractive to Bob.
* **Open to negotiation:** The message is phrased to encourage further discussion. If Bob rejects the initial offer, you can negotiate down towards your minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000).

**Important Note:**  There's no guarantee Bob will accept this high initial offer. However, this strategy maximizes your potential gain while still having the safety net of John's offer."
