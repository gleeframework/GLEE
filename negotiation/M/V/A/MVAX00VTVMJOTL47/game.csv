"I appreciate the offer, Alice, but I'm looking to spend a bit less. How about $8,500?  That's a fair price for both of us, considering your value and my budget.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $8,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $9,000? This would still be a great value for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Alice,3,
