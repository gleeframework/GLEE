{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $10,000 to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** $9,500 is more than your minimum of $8,000, so you're already making a profit.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** You're not asking for the full $10,000, leaving space for Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially reach a compromise.
* **It shows confidence:** By offering a price close to the perceived value, you demonstrate that you believe your product is worth it. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, Alice, but I'm looking to spend a bit less. How about $8,500?  That's a fair price for both of us, considering your value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $8,500 is a decent price, it's still below your desired profit margin. By rejecting Bob's offer, you can:

* **Maintain leverage:** Showing that you're not desperate to sell at a lower price increases your bargaining power.
* **Potentially get closer to your goal:**  By making a counteroffer, you might be able to secure a price closer to your desired $9,500.
* **See if Bob is truly committed:** If Bob is genuinely interested, he might be willing to come up a bit on his counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $8,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $9,000? This would still be a great value for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

Here's why this counteroffer is a good strategy:

* **Compromise:** You're meeting Bob halfway, showing you're willing to negotiate.
* **Maintain Profit:**  $9,000 still yields a decent profit for you, while being closer to your initial offer.
* **Positive Framing:**  You're emphasizing the value for Bob, making the offer more appealing. 

Let's see if Bob accepts!"
