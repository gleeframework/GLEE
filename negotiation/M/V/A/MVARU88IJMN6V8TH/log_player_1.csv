{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $130. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful."", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $130. This is above Bob's perceived value of $80, but significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150. This gives Bob some room to negotiate while ensuring I still make a decent profit.  I'm also highlighting the value of the product to encourage Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate it, but I was hoping to keep my spending within $80 for this product. Would it be possible for us to reach a price closer to that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150. While I'm open to negotiating, I won't accept such a low offer. I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $80 is just too low for me. How about we split the difference and I offer you the product for $110?  This still gives you a great price and allows me to make a fair profit."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Considering my budget constraints, could we aim for $95? This would still be a substantial saving for me and might allow for a fair transaction. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $95 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below my desired profit margin. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I won't accept an offer that doesn't at least get me closer to $150. I'll counteroffer again and see if we can find a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence.  $95 is getting closer, but I'm still a bit away from where I need to be.  Let's compromise at $105.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit while still giving you a good deal.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 105}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your patience and understanding. I really appreciate your flexibility. Considering our previous discussions, I believe $100 would be a fair price for both of us. It would allow me to stay within my budget while still providing you with a decent profit. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $100 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150. While I appreciate his willingness to negotiate, I'm not willing to settle for a price that low. I'll sell the product to John for $150 instead and ensure a profitable outcome."
