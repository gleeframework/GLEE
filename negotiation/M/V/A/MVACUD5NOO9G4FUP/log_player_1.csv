"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $100. This is a reasonable starting point, considering the product is worth at least $80 to me. I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium for it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $80 is the minimum I'm willing to accept, I'm not going to settle for that right away. I'm going to try and get closer to my initial asking price of $100."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
```

I'm going to counteroffer with $90. This is a compromise between my initial price and Bob's offer. I'm still trying to maximize my profit, but I'm also showing flexibility to reach a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer of $85. This is a good compromise and I'm happy to close the deal. While I could keep negotiating, there's a risk that Bob will walk away or that I might run out of rounds and have to sell to John for a lower price."
