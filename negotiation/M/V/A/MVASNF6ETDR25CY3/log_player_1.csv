{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I know you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's above Bob's perceived value, but not too far out there. This gives me room to negotiate while also maximizing my potential earnings."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value of the product. Would you be willing to consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. I'm confident I can get a better deal, either by negotiating further with Bob or selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to be closer to my asking price. How about we split the difference and settle on $10,500? This would be a fair price for both of us and allow us to finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that you're willing to compromise, but $10,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,000 and $10,500. How about we settle on $9,750? This would be a fair price for both of us and allow us to finalize this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While Bob's offer of $9,750 is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.  It's becoming clear that we're not going to reach an agreement, and I don't want to risk further negotiations dragging on.  Therefore, I'm choosing to sell the product to John for $10,000, which guarantees me my minimum value and saves me time and effort."
