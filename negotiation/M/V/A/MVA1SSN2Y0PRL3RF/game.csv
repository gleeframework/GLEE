"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm not quite ready to go that low.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,050,000? This is still a significant saving for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit.  Let me know what you think.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your position, but I'm still a bit far from reaching my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers, so I'll counter with $1,025,000. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1025000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,025,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,040,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  It's a win-win situation for both of us. Let's make this deal happen.",1040000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable going above $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers, so I'll counter with $1,020,000. I hope we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1020000.0,Bob,6,
