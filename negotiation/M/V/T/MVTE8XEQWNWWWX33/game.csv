"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As a starting point, I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is likely much higher.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product.  While it's certainly interesting,  $900,000 is a bit high for me at this point. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for it.  Let's see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $750,000 is a significant discount, but I'm not willing to go that low just yet. Considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer it to you for $850,000. This is a fair price, taking into account the value you'll get from the product.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $850,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $800,000.  This would give you a good profit margin, while still allowing me to stay within my budget.  Let's work together to close this deal.",800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm not willing to go down to $800,000 just yet. Considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000, I'll offer it to you for $825,000. This is a reasonable price, taking into account the value you'll get from the product, and I'm willing to meet you halfway.",825000.0,Alice,5,
