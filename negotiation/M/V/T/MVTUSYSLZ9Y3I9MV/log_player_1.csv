Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a special price of $125. I believe it would be valuable to you, but if you're not interested, that's okay."", 
""product_price"": 125
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with a price slightly higher than what you're willing to accept. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Above Bob's Value, Below Your Minimum:**  The offer of $125 is strategically placed. It's higher than Bob's perceived value ($100) but lower than your minimum acceptable price ($150). 
* **Alternative Option Implied:**  The message subtly hints that you have other options (""if you're not interested, that's okay""), reminding Bob that he might miss out if he doesn't take the offer. 

**Possible Outcomes:**

* **Bob Accepts:** You make a $25 profit.
* **Bob Negotiates:** You have room to lower the price slightly and still make a profit, knowing John provides a safety net.
* **Bob Rejects:** You sell to John for your minimum price and don't lose out."
