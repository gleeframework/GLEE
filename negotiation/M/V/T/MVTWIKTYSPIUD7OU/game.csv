,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,750,000 is well above my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, which is still a good deal for you considering its value to you. Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $850,000 is simply too far below what I need to make this deal work.  I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000. It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product, and I believe it's still a good deal for you. Let's see if we can find a compromise here.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $1,200,000 is still too high for me. I'm prepared to pay $950,000, which reflects the value I see in the product and is a fair compromise. I'm confident we can find a deal at this price.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand we're still a bit apart on price.  While I appreciate your offer, I need to make a profit on this deal.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000, which is a significant compromise from my previous offer. This price still reflects the value of the product, and I believe it's a fair offer.  Let's close this deal, Bob.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate, but $1,100,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $975,000, which is a significant increase from my last offer and demonstrates my genuine interest in this product. Let's find a compromise in the middle.",975000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer and your commitment to reaching a deal. However, $975,000 is still too far below what I need to make this work.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000, which is a significant compromise from my previous offer. I believe this price reflects the value of the product and allows us both to walk away with a good deal.  Let's reach an agreement here, Bob.",1050000.0,Alice,7,
