"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, I'm afraid $8000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $10500. It's a fair price considering the product's value and uniqueness.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I understand you're still a bit hesitant, Bob. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I can do $11000, but that's as low as I can go. It's a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with the value you'll get for your money.",11000.0,Alice,5,
