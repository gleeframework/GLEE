"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product. I believe that's a fair price considering it's the most I'm willing to spend.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your offer, but I'm not able to sell the product for $1,000,000.  It's worth significantly more to me. I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's value and allows me to make a reasonable profit. What do you say?",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, $1,250,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to meet you halfway at $1,125,000. This offer represents a significant investment on my part but would be a fair deal for both of us.",1125000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,125,000 is still below what I need to make this deal work. I'm willing to go down to $1,200,000. This is my final offer, as it's the absolute minimum I can accept. It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product. What's your decision?",1200000.0,Alice,5,
