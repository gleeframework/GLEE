"Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the opportunity, $2000000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to offer $1750000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",1750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  $1750000 is a good starting point, but I'm still not quite there.  I'm willing to come down to $1850000.  This reflects the significant value of the product, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position.  $1850000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1800000.  I believe this is a fair price considering the value we've both discussed.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",1800000.0,Bob,4,
