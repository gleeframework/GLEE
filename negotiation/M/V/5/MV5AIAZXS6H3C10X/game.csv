"Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that I believe is worth at least $1,000,000 to you.  This is a one-time offer, and if you decline, I'll be selling it to another buyer for that amount.  I'm confident that you'll find this product incredibly valuable.  Let's discuss a price that works for both of us. What do you say?",1050000.0,Alice,1,
