"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that I believe is worth at least $1,000,000 to you.  This is a one-time offer, and if you decline, I'll be selling it to another buyer for that amount.  I'm confident that you'll find this product incredibly valuable.  Let's discuss a price that works for both of us. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is appealing, it's still above your maximum budget of $1,000,000. You have a guaranteed alternative with John at your desired price point. Therefore, rejecting Alice's offer and buying from John is the most financially sound decision."
