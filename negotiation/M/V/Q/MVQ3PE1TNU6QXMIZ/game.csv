"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this unique product. It's a game-changer in its industry, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1200000.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $1200000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $900000 for it. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a fair price, Bob. However, I've done my research, and I believe the product's value is higher than $900000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $1050000. I think this is a reasonable price considering the product's unique features and benefits.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the counteroffer, Alice. I understand your perspective on the product's value, but I'm still not comfortable paying $1050000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so I'm counteroffering at $950000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and our previous discussions.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm still not convinced that $950000 is a fair price. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get closer to my minimum value of $1000000. I'm counteroffering at $1050000 again, but I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal, such as a free consultation and a 3-month warranty. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the added value",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I appreciate the extras you're offering, but I'm still not willing to pay $1050000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'm counteroffering at $925000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the extras you're offering.",925000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still not willing to go below $1000000. I'm willing to throw in a few more extras to sweeten the deal, such as a 6-month warranty and a personalized onboarding session. I'm also willing to give you a 2% discount on the price, which would bring the total to $980000. I think this is a fair price considering the added value and the product's worth",980000.0,Alice,7,

"Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I appreciate the additional extras you're offering, but I'm still not willing to pay $980000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from your previous offer, so I'm counteroffering at $955000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the extras you're offering.",955000.0,Bob,8,

"I'm starting to feel like we're getting a bit too close to the wire, Bob. I'm willing to make one final concession, but I need to get closer to my target price. I'm willing to throw in a 1-year warranty, a personalized onboarding session, and a 5% discount on the price, which would bring the total to $975000. I think this is a very fair price considering the product's value and the extras I'm offering. If you're still not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options",975000.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the final offer, Alice. I appreciate the additional extras you're offering, but I'm still not willing to pay $975000. I've gone as high as I can, and I'm willing to walk away if we can't come to an agreement. I'm counteroffering at $940000, and I'm willing to meet you halfway from there. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",940000.0,Bob,10,
