"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your suggestion, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the $20,000 price point. I am willing to pay up to $10,000 for the product. Would you consider meeting me halfway?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $10,000 is significantly below its true value.  How about we meet in the middle at $17,000? This offer reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your initial offer.",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I still find it challenging to justify spending $17,000 on this product. I would like to stick to my maximum budget of $10,000. Could we possibly come to an agreement closer to this figure?",10000.0,Bob,4,
