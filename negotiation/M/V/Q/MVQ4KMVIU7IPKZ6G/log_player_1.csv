I'm offering the product to Bob for $100. This is a fair price that allows me to earn a good profit while still being potentially attractive to Bob, as he values the product at $120."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is close to my minimum acceptable price and allows me to make a decent profit. It's better than selling to John for $80, so I'll accept Bob's offer."
