{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $20,000. It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 20000}
```

This offer starts with a relatively high price, aiming to leave room for negotiation while still maximizing potential profit.  It also includes a friendly message to encourage Bob to engage in the conversation.  I'm using a starting price of $20,000 because it's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  This strategy allows for some flexibility in negotiation and gives me room to drop the price if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but $20000 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider a lower price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, I'm not in a rush to sell.  Rejecting his offer allows me to potentially secure a higher price by continuing the negotiation.  I'll counter with a price slightly lower than my initial offer but higher than Bob's."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate your interest, Bob. $15,000 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $18,000?  That's a fair price that reflects the product's value."", ""product_price"": 18000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting closer to being interested, but $18000 is still a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $16000 for the product. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'll reject Bob's offer. While $16,000 is close to my minimum, I'm willing to risk losing this deal to potentially get a higher price from Bob or another buyer. I'll counter with a price closer to his offer, but still higher than my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to find the best price. I'm willing to meet you halfway.  $17,000 is my final offer.  If you're serious about getting this product, I encourage you to accept."", ""product_price"": 17000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit short of my budget. Would you be willing to come down to $15000? I really think that's a fair price for this product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

We've reached a stalemate. Bob's offer is my minimum, but I'm not willing to go lower.  Since I know John will pay $15,000, it's better to sell to him now and avoid further negotiation."
