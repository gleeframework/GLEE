"Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,400,000. This is a significant discount from its true value to me, but I believe it's a fair price considering your needs. Let me know what you think.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, that price is a bit too high for me.  I'd be willing to pay $600,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair offer considering its value to me.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $600,000 is far too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to at least get $1,200,000 for this product.  Let's meet in the middle.",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you're looking for a higher price, and I'm willing to move a bit closer to your position. How about $750,000? That's a significant increase from my previous offer and would be a mutually beneficial deal.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $750,000 is still too far below my minimum.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This is a significant concession, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let me know if you're willing to meet me there.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  While $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me, I'm willing to offer $800,000. This is my final offer, as I can always purchase the product from another seller for that price.  I believe this offer represents a fair deal for both of us. ",800000.0,Bob,6,
