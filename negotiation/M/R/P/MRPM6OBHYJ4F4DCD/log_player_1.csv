Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your product's value to me, but I believe we can reach an agreement closer to its actual worth. How about we aim for $950,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting to take $950,000, I believe I can get closer to my desired price. I'll try to negotiate a better deal in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is a bit too low.  We're both aware of the true value, and I'm confident we can find a middle ground.  Let's meet at $1,050,000.  This is a fair price that allows both of us to benefit from this deal."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I've given this careful consideration, and I'd like to propose $1,025,000 as a compromise. This still leaves room for both of us to feel satisfied with the transaction. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,025,000

I'll accept Bob's offer of $1,025,000. It's a good compromise, and I'm confident I won't be able to get a much better price with the remaining rounds."
