"Bob, I appreciate you coming back with a counteroffer. While $800000 is too low for me, I'm willing to meet you halfway.  I'm offering the product for $1150000. This price reflects both the value of the product and our potential for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's see if we can close this deal.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1150000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm willing to offer $950000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me and allows us to both walk away satisfied. Let's see if we can close this deal.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, your offer of $950000 is getting closer, but we still have some ground to cover. I'm willing to come down to $1050000, which shows my commitment to finding a solution that works for both of us.  It's a fair price that acknowledges the value of the product and allows us to close this deal. What do you say?",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1050000 is a significant improvement, it's still outside my budget. I'm willing to offer $980000 for the product.  I believe this price reflects a fair compromise and allows us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's see if we can close this deal.",980000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, your offer of $980000 is getting closer, but we're still a little apart. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer the product for $1015000. This price acknowledges your budget constraints while still reflecting the value of the product. I truly believe this is a fair price that allows us both to walk away satisfied. What are your thoughts?",1015000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1015000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to offer $1000000 for the product.  This price is the highest I can go, but I think it's still fair given the value of the product. If you accept, we can close this deal. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1000000.0,Bob,8,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I've really enjoyed negotiating with you. However, $1000000 is still a bit too low for me. To make this deal work, I need to be at $1100000.  This is my final offer. If we can agree on this price, we can close the deal right now.  If not, I'll need to move forward with another buyer.  Let me know your decision.",1100000.0,Alice,9,
