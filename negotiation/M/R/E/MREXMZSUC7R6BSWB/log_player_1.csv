"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you this product for $1,700,000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1700000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm opening with a price that's above Bob's perceived value but still within a reasonable range. This allows for some negotiation room.
* **Positive Tone:** The message is friendly and emphasizes the value of the product to Bob. This helps build a positive rapport.
* **Room for Compromise:** I'm leaving enough space for Bob to make a counteroffer, which will give me a chance to adjust my price and potentially close the deal.
* **John's Offer as a Safety Net:**  I'm aware that I can always sell to John for $1,500,000, which gives me confidence in pushing for a higher price with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $800000 for the product. Let's see if we can work something out. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  $800,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. Accepting it would be a huge loss for me.
* **Negotiation is Possible:**  Bob is willing to negotiate, indicating there's room to reach a compromise. I'm confident that I can get a better price by continuing the negotiation.
* **John's Offer:** While John's offer is my safety net, I still have room to negotiate a better price with Bob.  There's no need to sell to John yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming back with a counteroffer. While $800,000 is too low for me, I'm willing to meet you halfway.  I'm offering the product for $1,150,000. This price reflects both the value of the product and our potential for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a Compromise:**  I'm moving closer to Bob's offer but still keeping a significant profit margin. This shows good faith while maintaining my position.
* **Highlighting Mutual Benefit:** The message emphasizes the win-win potential of the deal, making Bob more likely to consider it.
* **Clear and Concise:**  The counteroffer is straightforward and avoids excessive negotiation tactics that could be seen as aggressive.
* **Maintaining John's Offer:** I'm still aware of my backup option with John, giving me the confidence to stand firm on a price that is fair to both parties."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1150000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm willing to offer $950000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me and allows us to both walk away satisfied. Let's see if we can close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** $950,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. While Bob is showing a willingness to increase his offer, it's not enough for me to accept at this point.
* **Potential for a Better Deal:** I believe there's still room for negotiation. Bob has already raised his offer twice, indicating that he might be willing to go higher.
* **John's Offer Provides Security:** I can always sell to John for $1,500,000, so there's no rush to accept Bob's offer. I'll continue to explore whether I can secure a more profitable deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, your offer of $950,000 is getting closer, but we still have some ground to cover. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000, which shows my commitment to finding a solution that works for both of us.  It's a fair price that acknowledges the value of the product and allows us to close this deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  I'm again moving closer to Bob's offer, showing flexibility while still maintaining a healthy profit margin.
* **Emphasis on Mutual Benefit:** I'm reiterating the win-win potential of the deal, reminding Bob that a compromise will benefit both of us. 
* **Clear and Concise:** The counteroffer is straightforward and avoids unnecessary language.
* **Strategic Positioning:**  I'm leaving some room for Bob to negotiate further without jeopardizing my minimum price. 
* **John's Offer Remains a Safety Net:** I'm still confident in my ability to sell to John for $1,500,000, so I can continue to push for a better deal with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1050000 is a significant improvement, it's still outside my budget. I'm willing to offer $980000 for the product.

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $980,000.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** $980,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's not enough for me to accept yet.
* **Potential for a Higher Price:**  I'm optimistic that Bob might be willing to go even higher, as he's clearly been increasing his offer each round.
* **John's Offer is Secure:** I can always sell to John for $1,500,000, which provides me with a solid backup option. I'm not under pressure to accept Bob's offer right now. 
* **Negotiation Time:**  With several rounds left, I want to see if I can get Bob to increase his offer even further.  I'm willing to continue the negotiation, as there's still potential to close a deal with a higher price."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, your offer of $980,000 is getting closer, but we're still a little apart. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer the product for $1,015,000. This price acknowledges your budget constraints while still reflecting the value of the product. I truly believe this is a fair price that allows us both to walk away satisfied. What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 1015000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Further Compromise:** I'm continuing to demonstrate flexibility by coming down further, but still maintaining a strong profit margin.

* **Creating Urgency:**  By suggesting that this is a final offer, I'm creating a sense of urgency and encouraging Bob to accept.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1015000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to offer $1000000 for the product.  This price is the highest I can go, but I think it's still fair given the value of the product. If you accept, we can close this deal. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** $1,000,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's not enough for me to accept yet.
* **Limited Negotiation Time:**  With only two rounds left, I need to be strategic. Accepting Bob's offer would result in a significant loss for me.
* **Potential for a Better Deal:**  Bob has indicated that this is his final offer, but there's a chance he might be willing to go higher if I continue to push.
* **John's Offer Remains a Strong Option:** I can always sell to John for $1,500,000, which gives me a safety net. I'm not under pressure to accept Bob's offer immediately.
* **Final Round Push:** I'm going to make one final counteroffer to see if I can get Bob to increase his offer. If he doesn't budge, I'll likely sell to John."
