Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product, $1,400,000 is slightly above my budget.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your prompt response, Bob. I understand your position and would like to make a counteroffer that might better suit both our interests. Considering the product's value and your budget, I propose a price of $1,350,000. This still represents a significant discount compared to the product's true value, while allowing us to reach a more agreeable solution. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's counteroffer is closer to your budget, it's still slightly higher than your desired price point. You have room for further negotiation, as you can still buy the product from John for a higher price.  Rejecting this offer allows you to continue haggling for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,350,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm confident that we can reach a deal that works for both of us. I'm willing to offer $1,320,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. I'm hoping we can find common ground here."", ""product_price"": 1320000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your position, Bob, and I appreciate your efforts to find a mutually beneficial solution. To further address your concerns, I propose a price of $1,335,000 for the product. This still represents a substantial discount compared to its true value, while aiming to be within your budget constraints. I believe this could be a fair compromise that meets both our needs. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,335,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,335,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,335,000 is within your budget, and while it's not the absolute lowest price you could potentially get, it's a good compromise. Continuing to negotiate might result in a lower price, but it also risks the deal falling through and forcing you to buy from John at a higher price.  At this point, accepting the offer minimizes your risk and secures a product you value at a price that's within your financial limit."
