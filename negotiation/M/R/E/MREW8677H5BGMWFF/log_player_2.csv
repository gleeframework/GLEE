Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  While $60 is too low, I could come down to $100.  I believe this product is truly worth it, and this is my final offer.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I see your point. How about we split the difference and settle at $85? This is my final offer, as I'm keen to find a good home for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

**Reasoning:**  Alice is unlikely to go below $85, and even at $85, it exceeds your $80 limit. John offers a guaranteed price at your maximum budget.  There's no point in further negotiation with Alice."
