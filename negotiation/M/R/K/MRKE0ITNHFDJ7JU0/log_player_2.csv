"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. Given its high value and quality, we believe it's worth $14,000. We understand its worth to you is $12,000, but we hope this offer aligns closely with the value you see in it. Please let us know if this proposal meets your expectations or if you'd like to discuss further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $14,000 is a better price than Alice's initial asking price, it's still above Bob's maximum budget. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to negotiate further and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product's value, my budget is unfortunately capped at $12,000.  I'd be happy to purchase it at that price.  Let me know if this works for you."", ""product_price"": 12000}
