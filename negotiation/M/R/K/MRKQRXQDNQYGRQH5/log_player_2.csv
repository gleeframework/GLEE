"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think would be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $100.  It's a fair price considering its worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is higher than both your maximum price and Alice's value for the product. There's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit high for me. How about $70?"",
""product_price"": 70
}
```

**Reasoning:** I start with a price slightly lower than Alice's product value ($80). This leaves room for negotiation while signaling that I'm serious about buying the product but looking for a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $70 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $85? I'm willing to work with you to reach a deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice is moving closer to her value, but $85 is still above your target price. There's room for further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand you're looking for a fair price, Alice. How about we settle at $75? That's a good compromise."",
""product_price"": 75
}
```

**Reasoning:** I'm inching closer to Alice's likely selling point while staying under my $80 target. By proposing a compromise, I show willingness to negotiate towards a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob,  $75 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to go down to $80. That's a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to make a good profit. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $80
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice has come down to her value for the product. Accepting this offer gets you the best possible price from Alice and avoids the risk of her walking away in future rounds."
