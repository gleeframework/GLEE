"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1000000.  It's a truly unique opportunity, and I'm confident you'll find it incredibly valuable.  Let's chat about it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is a good starting point, but there's room for negotiation.  It's unlikely that Alice is willing to sell for the absolute minimum, and I have a buffer of $500,000 before needing to resort to John.  Rejecting the offer allows me to see if Alice is willing to come down in price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the opportunity, $1,000,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'd be willing to pay $750,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

My counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial price, but it still leaves room for negotiation. I'm aiming to get a good deal, but also want to avoid alienating Alice early on. This counteroffer signals my interest in the product while also demonstrating that I'm willing to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I'm happy to negotiate, $750000 is still a bit below what I need.  Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to lower my price to $875000.  This would be a fair deal for both of us, and would allow us to move forward.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's counteroffer is a step in the right direction, it's still higher than I'm comfortable with. I have a buffer of $625,000 before needing to go to John, so I can afford to keep pushing for a lower price. Rejecting this offer allows me to continue negotiating and hopefully secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. $875,000 is still a bit high for me, but I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  I'm willing to offer $800,000 for the product.  This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can close the deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm still aiming for a price lower than Alice's offer, but I'm getting closer to a potential deal. By offering $800,000, I'm showing that I'm willing to compromise while still leaving some room for negotiation.  This demonstrates that I'm serious about buying the product, but I'm not going to overpay."
