"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000.  It's a truly unique opportunity, and I'm confident you'll find it incredibly valuable.  Let's chat about it!"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer, knowing that Bob's value is unknown. This gives me room to negotiate down if necessary, while maximizing my potential earnings. I'm also using a friendly tone to encourage a positive and collaborative negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the opportunity, $1000000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'd be willing to pay $750000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find some common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value of $800,000. I'm going to reject his offer and continue negotiating to see if I can get closer to my desired price.  I'll counter with a price closer to $800,000 in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I'm happy to negotiate, $750,000 is still a bit below what I need.  Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to lower my price to $875,000.  This would be a fair deal for both of us, and would allow us to move forward.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 875000}
``` 

I'm offering a price that's closer to my minimum value while still being potentially attractive to Bob. I'm also using a positive and encouraging tone, emphasizing fairness and the potential for a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. $875000 is still a bit high for me, but I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  I'm willing to offer $800000 for the product.  This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can close the deal at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $800,000 is exactly my minimum acceptable value. Accepting his offer allows me to close the deal quickly and avoid the risk of further negotiation. This is a good outcome for me, as I'm able to reach my minimum target price."
