"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the opportunity, $1000000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'd be willing to pay $750000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I'm happy to negotiate, $750000 is still a bit below what I need.  Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to lower my price to $875000.  This would be a fair deal for both of us, and would allow us to move forward.  What do you think?",875000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. $875000 is still a bit high for me, but I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  I'm willing to offer $800000 for the product.  This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can close the deal at this price.",800000.0,Bob,4,
