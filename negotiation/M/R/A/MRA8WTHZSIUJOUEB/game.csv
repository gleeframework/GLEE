"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable,  $9,500 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $7,000? I think that's a fair price.",7000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $9,500 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $7,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $8,200. What do you think?",8200.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  $8,200 is closer, but I'm aiming for something closer to $7,500. Would you be willing to come down a bit more?",7500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a better deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $7,500. I'm willing to compromise again and offer it to you for $8,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great value for the product. What do you think?",8000.0,Alice,5,
