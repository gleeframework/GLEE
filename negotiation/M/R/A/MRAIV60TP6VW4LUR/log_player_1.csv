I'm offering the product to Bob for $95. This leaves room for negotiation while still ensuring I get more than my minimum acceptable price of $80."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer of $85. While it's above my minimum of $80, I believe I can get closer to my desired price point of $95. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
``` 

I'm counteroffering with a price of $90. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still allows me to gain more than Bob's last offer while remaining open to further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $87. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer of $87. While it's not my ideal price, it's higher than my minimum and closer to what I was hoping to get.  It's also more than I'd get from John.  The negotiation is taking time, and I'd like to close this deal."
