Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'm trying to stay within my budget. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $9,000 is better than my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,500.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement!"", ""product_price"": 9500}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'm offering $9,250. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,250

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

While I would prefer a higher price, I'm starting to feel the pressure of time. Accepting Bob's offer of $9,250 is still a good deal for me, as it's above my minimum of $8,000."
