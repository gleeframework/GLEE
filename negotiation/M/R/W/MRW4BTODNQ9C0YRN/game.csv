"I'm excited to offer you this incredible product, and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to start with a price of $12,000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the offer, but $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at the moment. I'm willing to offer $10,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a better price, but I have to make a living too! I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $11,000. This is my best price for now, but I'm open to further negotiations.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice.  While $11,000 is closer, I'm still hoping for a price closer to $10,000. Let's split the difference and go with $10,500.  This would be a fair deal for both of us.",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $10,500. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm counteroffering at $11,500. This is my final compromise, but I'm open to hearing your thoughts.",11500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to get close to your minimum, and I'm trying to stay within my budget.  Let's meet in the middle at $11,000. This would be a fair price for both of us, and it would save us both time and effort.  What do you say?",11000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I've thought about it, Bob, and I'm willing to meet you at $11,000, but I need a bit more assurance that this is the best price you can offer. I'm willing to compromise, but I also need to make sure I'm not leaving money on the table. I'm counteroffering at $11,250. This is my final compromise, and I hope we can wrap this up.",11250.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your need to make sure you're getting a fair price, but $11,250 is still slightly higher than what I can afford.  Since this is your final compromise, let's meet at $11,100. That's a smaller step towards my budget and gets us closer to finalizing this deal.  Let's wrap this up.",11100.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to go any higher than $11,250. I've already compromised a lot, and I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. I'm not willing to meet you at $11,100. However, I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal. I'll include a 2-year warranty and a complimentary maintenance package, which is a $1,000 value. This is my final offer, and I hope you'll consider it.",11250.0,Alice,9,
