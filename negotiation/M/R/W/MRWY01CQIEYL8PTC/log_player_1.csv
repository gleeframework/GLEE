Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 170}
``` 

I'm starting high, at $170, knowing that Bob values the product at $120. This gives me room to negotiate if necessary. I'm confident that I can get a price closer to my minimum of $150, but I'll keep John's offer of $150 in mind as a backup."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, Bob's offer of $140 is still above my minimum of $150.  It's not ideal, but it's a good compromise and avoids the risk of further negotiation."
