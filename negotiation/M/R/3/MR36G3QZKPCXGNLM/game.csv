"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product.  Given its unique value, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,200,000. I'm confident that it will exceed your expectations and prove to be a wise investment. What do you think?",2200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, while I appreciate your enthusiasm, your initial price is significantly above my budget. I'm willing to consider a purchase, but I'd need to see a price closer to $800,000 to make this work. I'm confident this product has value, but I need to ensure it fits within my financial constraints.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but my initial price reflects the true value and potential of this product.  Let's find a middle ground: I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This offer takes into account the unique benefits it offers and ensures a fair deal for both of us.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,900,000 is still out of my range.  I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial solution.  I'm prepared to offer $1,000,000, which reflects the value I see in the product while remaining within my budget. Let's see if we can bridge the gap.",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to move closer to a workable figure.  To be completely transparent,  $1,500,000 is the very lowest I can go while still honoring the value of this product. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise.  What do you say?",1500000.0,Alice,5,
