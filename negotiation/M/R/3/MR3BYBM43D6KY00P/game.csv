"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to offer it to you for $6,500. I think this is a great starting point, and I'm open to negotiating further to find a price that works for both of us.",6500.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $6,500 is a bit high for my budget. Could you do $4,000?",4000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $4,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer it to you for $5,500. This is a significant discount from my original price, and I think it's a fair price considering the value the product brings. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",5500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate the compromise, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $4,750?",4750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground, but I'm still not comfortable with $4,750. I'm willing to make another concession and offer it to you for $5,200. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal considering the product's value. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",5200.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"You're right, that is a great deal for this product.  To be honest, I was hoping to keep it closer to $5,000. Would you consider $4,900?",4900.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get closer to your target price, but I'm still not comfortable with $4,900. I'm willing to make another small concession and offer it to you for $5,100. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's still a great deal considering the product's value. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",5100.0,Alice,7,
