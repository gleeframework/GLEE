"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with an offer of $100.  This leaves room for negotiation but also ensures I get a good price, considering the product is worth $120 to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $90 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get closer to my ideal price with further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 95}
```

I'm raising the price slightly to $95. This is still a good deal for Bob, and it gets me closer to my goal of $100."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $92.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While I'd prefer to get closer to $100, $92.5 is a good price and I don't want to risk losing the deal by pushing too hard."
