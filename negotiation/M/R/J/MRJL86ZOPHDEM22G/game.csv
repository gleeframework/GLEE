"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $14,500 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $11,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",11000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your position but $11,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000?",13000.0,Alice,3,
