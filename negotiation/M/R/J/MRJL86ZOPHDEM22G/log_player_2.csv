"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and features, I'm asking for $14,500. I believe it's a fair price that reflects its worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

``` 

The product is worth $12,000 to Alice, and she's asking for $14,500. This is more than your maximum budget of $10,000.  Rejecting her offer is the best first step. You'll try to negotiate a lower price or buy from John."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your position but $11,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000

``` 

While $13,000 is closer to your budget, it's still over your ideal price point. It's worth trying to negotiate further to see if you can get closer to your desired $10,000."
