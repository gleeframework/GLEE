"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this exceptional product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to offer it to you for $15000.",12000.0,Alice,1,,

"I'm interested in the product, but I think $12000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $9000. Can you consider that?",9000.0,Bob,2,,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer,"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, I'm afraid I can't accept your offer of $9000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll make a counteroffer of $12500. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value."
"I understand that you're looking for a good deal, Bob. However, I've already made a significant concession by offering you $12500. I'm willing to make another slight adjustment to $13000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's a fair price for the product's value.",13000.0,Alice,3,,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer,
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice, but $13000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $11500. Can you consider that?",11500.0,Bob,4,,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer,"I understand that you're still looking for a better deal, Bob. However, I've already made significant concessions and I'm getting close to my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving money on the table. I'll make a counteroffer of $12250. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's still a fair price for the product's value."
"I'm starting to feel that we're getting close to a deal, Bob. However, I still need to make sure I'm getting a good price for the product. I'm willing to make another slight adjustment to $12750. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's still a fair price for the product's value.",12750.0,Alice,5,,

"I'm still a bit hesitant about the price, Alice. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $11250. Can you consider that?",11250.0,Bob,6,,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer,"I understand that you're still trying to negotiate, Bob, but I'm starting to feel that we're getting too close to my minimum price. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure it's worth it. I'll meet you at $12000, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'm afraid I'll have to consider other options."
"I've made a significant concession, Bob, and I'm willing to meet you at my minimum price of $12000. I'm not willing to go any lower, so I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price. If not, I'll have to consider other options.",12000.0,Alice,7,,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer,
"I understand that you're at your minimum price, Alice, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $11500. Can you consider that?",11500.0,Bob,8,,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer,"Bob, I understand that you're still trying to negotiate, but I've already met you at my minimum price of $12000 and you rejected it. I'm not willing to go any lower than that. I'm starting to think that we're not going to come to an agreement, so I'm going to consider selling the product to John for $12000."
"I'm afraid I've reached my limit, Bob. I've made it clear that I'm willing to sell the product for $12000, and you've rejected that offer. I'm going to have to move on to other options. I'll let you know if you change your mind, but for now, I'm going to consider other buyers.",12000.0,Alice,9,,
