Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $150. I believe it's a fair price considering its value. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 150
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** My goal is to earn as much as possible. Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $100, I should aim higher with Bob.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $150 leaves space for potential negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, and we can settle on a price higher than $100. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** There's a risk Bob might reject the offer, but the potential reward of selling it for $150 (or close to it) outweighs settling for the guaranteed $100.

This strategy balances ambition with the security of a guaranteed sale."
