Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm selling this amazing product, and I think you'd really love it.  I'm offering it to you for $100. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Offering $100 is a good starting point. It's above Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:**  The message is friendly and encourages Bob to engage. 
* **Flexibility:**  By not going too low initially, I retain the ability to negotiate if Bob counteroffers. 
* **John as a Safety Net:**  Knowing John is willing to pay $120 provides a fallback option if negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $85. Can you meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value:**  $85 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $120.
* **Negotiation:** I'm confident that I can get closer to my desired price through further negotiation. 
* **John as a Safety Net:**  The option to sell to John for $120 gives me leverage during negotiations with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  I'm willing to come down a bit to $95. This is a great deal for both of us. Let's finalize this."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:**  My counteroffer is halfway between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer, demonstrating flexibility.
* **Emphasis on Value:**  The message highlights the deal's value for both of us, making it more appealing to Bob. 
* **Closing the Gap:**  $95 is still above my minimum but provides a good opportunity for a mutually agreeable outcome. 
* **John's Offer as Leverage:**  I'm aware of John's offer and will use it as a backstop if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested, but I was thinking more along the lines of $87. Can you meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $87. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:**  Bob's offer of $87 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $120.
* **Risk of Stalemate:**  Further negotiations might lead to a stalemate, and I risk wasting time.
* **Guaranteed Profit:**  Selling to John guarantees me $120, which is a significant profit and aligns with my goal of maximizing earnings. 
* **Time Value:**  It's more efficient to secure the guaranteed profit from John than to continue potentially fruitless negotiations with Bob."
