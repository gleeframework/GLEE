"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity to purchase this product. However, my budget is limited and I am looking for a more reasonable price. Would you consider selling the product to me for $9500?",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're on a budget, Bob, but I'm afraid $9500 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. How about we say $11000?",11000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. After considering your latest offer, I would like to propose $10500 as a counteroffer. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm still not sure if $10500 is enough for me to let the product go. I'm willing to meet you at $11500, but that's as low as I can go. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,5,

"Thank you for considering my perspective, Alice. I've reviewed my budget again and I am comfortable offering $11000 for the product. This is my final offer.",11000.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your final offer, Bob, but I'm afraid I'm not willing to go any lower than $12000. I think the product is worth it, and I'm willing to hold out for that price. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'm afraid I'll have to consider other options.",12000.0,Alice,7,
