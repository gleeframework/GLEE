"Alice, your product is enticing, but $950,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000, which is still a fair price given its value to me.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While $850,000 is tempting, the value this product offers is truly exceptional. I'm willing to come down slightly to $925,000. This feels like a fair compromise.  What do you say?",925000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I see you're willing to negotiate, and I appreciate that.  However, $925,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm prepared to pay $875,000, which is a significant step up from my previous offer and a fair compromise.  Let's finalize this deal at this price.",875000.0,Bob,4,
