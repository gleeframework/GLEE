"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm starting with a high price of $1,000,000. This sets a high bar and gives me room to negotiate downwards if needed. I'm confident the product is worth more than $800,000 to Bob, so I'm hoping he'll see value in it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's close to my desired price, I believe there's still room for negotiation. I want to see if I can get closer to my initial asking price of $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

I'm countering with $950,000. This is a compromise, showing flexibility while still aiming for a higher price than Bob's offer. Hopefully, this will incentivize Bob to close the deal without going through more rounds of negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer of $850,000. While it's getting closer to my minimum, I still believe there's room for improvement. I'm hoping to push for a slightly higher price before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm countering with $900,000.  I'm meeting Bob halfway between his last offer and my previous counteroffer. This shows good faith and willingness to compromise, while still aiming for a price closer to my initial goal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $800,000.  Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, but it's clear he's not willing to go higher.  I'd rather take the guaranteed sale from John than risk further negotiation with Bob, which could potentially lead to a lower price or a deal falling through entirely."
