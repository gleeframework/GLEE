Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm starting high, aiming for a significant profit. Since I don't know Bob's value for the product, I'm pushing for the maximum possible. If he rejects, I'll adjust my offer based on his counteroffer, always keeping in mind my minimum value of $800,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While Bob's offer is my minimum, I'm not satisfied with just breaking even. I'm willing to continue negotiating to see if I can get a higher price.  I believe I can still convince Bob to pay more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm lowering my offer slightly, but still aiming for a significant profit.  I believe $900,000 is a fair compromise.  I'm confident that I can get Bob to agree to a price closer to my desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $850,000 is significantly closer to my desired price and it's worth taking.  It's a good balance between getting a reasonable profit and avoiding the risk of losing the deal and having to settle for John's offer of $800,000."
