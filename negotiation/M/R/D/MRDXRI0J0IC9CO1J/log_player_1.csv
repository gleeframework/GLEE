{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really love it! I'm asking for $110 for it, which is a great deal considering its value. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum acceptable price ($100) to leave room for negotiation.  I'm also highlighting the product's value in my message to try and pique Bob's interest.  Let's see how he responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $110 is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $60 for it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price.  I can still get a better deal with John if I need to."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate you're interested but $60 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $90.  This still gives you a great deal on a product that's worth a lot more.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 90} 
```

I'm trying to meet Bob halfway, but still leaving some room for potential negotiation. I'm emphasizing the value of the product to justify my counteroffer. Let's see if this will work!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm getting closer but $90 is still a bit much for my budget. How about $70? That's a fair price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price. While I'm willing to negotiate, I don't want to risk getting stuck with a price that's too low. It's better to sell to John and guarantee my minimum profit."
