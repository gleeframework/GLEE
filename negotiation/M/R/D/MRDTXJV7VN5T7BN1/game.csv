"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to let it go for $15000. What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $15000 is a bit out of my range.  I'm really interested in this product, but I can only go up to $8000 right now.  Let me know what you think.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $8000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $12000. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really benefit from having this product. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. While I'm still interested, $12000 is still too high for me. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  How about $9500?  I'm ready to close the deal at this price.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're still looking for a better deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $9500. I'm willing to come down another $500, so I'm offering the product to you for $11500. This is a great compromise, and I think it's a fair price. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still not quite there on the price.  How about $10000? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to finalize the deal. Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,6,
