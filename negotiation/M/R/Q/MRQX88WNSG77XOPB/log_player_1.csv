Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you see in this product. However, given my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price closer to $1000000. I believe this aligns better with what I am able to invest at this time.

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,000,000 is my floor price, I'm not desperate and believe I can get closer to my ideal price with further negotiation. I'll see if I can get him closer to my initial offer in the next round."

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. While I appreciate the compromise, I still feel that we might be able to find a price closer to my budget. How about $1100000? This would allow us to work within my financial limits while still valuing the product appropriately. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While we are getting closer, I still believe I can push for a price higher than $1,100,000. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer, but not too far from Bob's current offer to keep the negotiation moving forward."
