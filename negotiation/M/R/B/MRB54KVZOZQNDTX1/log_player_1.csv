I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,250,000. This is a reasonable starting point, as it's slightly above the minimum I'm willing to accept and leaves room for negotiation.  I believe Bob will be willing to pay this, as the product is worth $1,200,000 to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,200,000 is my minimum, I believe I can do better. I'll counter with a slightly lower price in the next round to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1225000}

I'm going to counter with a price of $1,225,000.  This is a compromise, showing Bob that I'm willing to negotiate while still ensuring I get a price that's closer to what I want."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,210,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,210,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I was hoping for a slightly higher price,  $1,210,000 is close enough to my minimum and saves me the time and effort of further negotiation.  It's also better than selling to John for $1,200,000."
