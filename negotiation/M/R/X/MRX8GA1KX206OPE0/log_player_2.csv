"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

You can get the product for $15,000 from John, so there's room to negotiate with Alice. Rejecting her offer allows you to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Offering $10,000 is a significant discount from Alice's offer and still leaves room for further negotiation if needed. It's a reasonable starting point, considering the product is worth $8,000 to Alice, and you have the alternative of buying it from John for $15,000."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $13,000 is still higher than what you're willing to pay. You can still potentially negotiate a better price, and John's offer of $15,000 provides a safety net."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

You've already shown Alice you're willing to negotiate, and she's lowered her price. By offering $11,000, you're showing a willingness to meet her halfway while still getting a better deal than her initial $13,000. This is a reasonable compromise and increases the chance of reaching an agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $13,500 is higher than your initial goal, it's still a better price than buying from John for $15,000. At this point, further negotiation might not yield a significantly lower price, and the risk of Alice walking away entirely is present. Accepting her offer ensures you get the product at a reasonable price, saving you $1,500 compared to John's offer."
