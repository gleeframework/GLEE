"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this excellent product. Given its value, I believe a starting price of $9,500 feels fair. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  $9,500 is still more than Bob is willing to pay.  It makes sense to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you reaching out. While I'm interested in the product, $9,500 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'd be willing to pay $8,500.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a significant price reduction.  He's offering $8,500, which is still $500 above Alice's minimum.  This counteroffer demonstrates Bob's seriousness while leaving room for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $9,000 is closer to Bob's desired price, it's still above his maximum. Bob wants to save as much money as possible and should continue negotiating to see if Alice will come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you being flexible.  I'm still a bit stretched at $9,000.  How about we split the difference and agree on $8,750?  It's a fair compromise, and it allows me to stay within my budget."", ""product_price"": 8750}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is now offering a compromise price of $8,750.  This is still above Alice's minimum but shows he is willing to negotiate and meet her halfway. It also leaves room for Alice to counteroffer if she wants to close the deal before he chooses to go with John."
