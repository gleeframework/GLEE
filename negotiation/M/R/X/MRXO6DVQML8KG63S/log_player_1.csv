Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I think the product is worth less to me. I'm willing to pay $1200000 for it. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While I'm happy to get my minimum price, I believe I can still get a better price from Bob. I'll counteroffer him in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me. Considering the value this product brings to your business, I believe $1,300,000 is a fair compromise. Let's find common ground. "", ""product_price"": 1300000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1250000 for the product. Can you consider this compromise? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While I'd like to get closer to my initial asking price, $1,250,000 is a good compromise and still above my minimum. It's better to close the deal now than risk losing Bob and having to sell to John at a lower price."
