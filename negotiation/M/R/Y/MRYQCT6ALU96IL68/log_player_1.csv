"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Explanation:**

While $900,000 is a decent amount, it's still significantly below the product's worth to Bob. I'm aiming for a higher price and will counteroffer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $900,000 is a bit too low for me. Considering the value of the product to both of us, I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.

Let's work together to find a solution that satisfies both parties."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $950,000 is closer to what I'd like, it's still below my minimum price point.  I'll continue negotiating, hoping to get closer to $1,000,000. I'm not yet ready to sell to John for $1,000,000 because I believe I can get a better price with Bob."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand we're getting close, but $980,000 is still not quite there.

**Explanation:**

With only two rounds left, the negotiations are getting close, but Bob is still not willing to meet my minimum price point.  While I'd prefer to get a higher price, I don't want to risk losing out entirely. Selling to John for $1,000,000 guarantees me a good profit and secures the deal."
