"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you this product, which I know is worth at least $1,000,000 to you, for a price that's incredibly fair. I'm confident you'll see its value. Let's discuss a mutually beneficial price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

Since you're trying to save money, and John is willing to sell the product for the same price as Alice, there's no reason to accept Alice's offer. You can get the same product for the same price from John."
