"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product and your counteroffer.  While I value your willingness to negotiate, $1,200,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This price reflects the product's true value and provides a good opportunity for both of us.  Let me know what you think.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
