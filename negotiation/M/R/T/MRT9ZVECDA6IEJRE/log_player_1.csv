"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product! It's a valuable asset with a lot of potential. I'm confident it will be a great investment for you. I'm starting with a price of $1,400,000,  but I'm open to discussing your thoughts and coming to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price that's closer to my minimum than Bob's perceived value. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Showing openness:**  I'm emphasizing that I'm open to negotiation to encourage Bob to counteroffer and engage in the process.
* **Highlighting value:**  I'm emphasizing the value of the product to potentially sway Bob towards accepting a higher price.

**Strategy:**

This initial offer aims to establish a starting point and gauge Bob's interest.  By setting a price that's slightly higher than his perceived value, I'm pushing him to counteroffer, creating an opportunity for me to negotiate and ultimately secure a better deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for it. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $1,200,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000 and even lower than my initial offer. 
* **Potential for better deal:**  There are still rounds left. I can counteroffer and attempt to reach a more favorable price.
* **John's offer is a safety net:**  Knowing John is willing to pay $1,500,000 gives me the leverage to hold out for a better deal from Bob.

**Strategy:**

Rejecting Bob's offer and proceeding to the next round allows me to maintain control of the negotiation. I can use this opportunity to make a counteroffer closer to my desired price and see if Bob is willing to compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product and your counteroffer.  While I value your willingness to negotiate, $1,200,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This price reflects the product's true value and provides a good opportunity for both of us.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-offer closer to my desired price:** I'm increasing Bob's offer by $100,000, but still keeping it below my minimum acceptable price. This shows flexibility while maintaining a firm stance.
* **Emphasis on value:**  I'm reiterating the product's value to justify the price and encourage Bob to reconsider.
* **Positive framing:** I'm using positive language (""good opportunity"") to create a sense of collaboration and encourage acceptance.

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer aims to bridge the gap between our desired prices. It allows me to test Bob's willingness to compromise while remaining within a reasonable range for both parties. I'm still open to further negotiation, but I'm demonstrating that I'm serious about my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I understand that the product is valuable, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for it. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:** Bob's offer of $1,250,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Room for negotiation:**  We are only in round 4. There are still several rounds left for negotiation, and I can attempt to get closer to my desired price.
* **John's offer is a strong backup:** Knowing John is willing to pay $1,500,000 provides me with the confidence to continue negotiating with Bob.

**Strategy:**

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can continue the negotiation process. I believe there's a good chance that I can push Bob closer to my target price in the upcoming rounds."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're still trying to find a price that works for you, and I appreciate your continued interest in the product.  However, $1,250,000 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's try to split the difference.  I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This would be a good compromise, and it would allow us both to benefit from this deal.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise approach:**  I'm taking a middle ground by offering a price halfway between my previous offer and Bob's last offer. This demonstrates my willingness to compromise and meet him halfway.
* **Positive framing:** I'm using phrases like ""good compromise"" and ""benefit from this deal"" to emphasize the potential for a mutually beneficial outcome.
* **Emphasizing continued interest:** I'm acknowledging Bob's interest to keep the negotiation amicable and encourage him to continue.

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer aims to find a middle ground and potentially reach a deal. It's a more moderate approach than my previous offer, while still remaining above my minimum acceptable price. This strategy aims to gauge Bob's flexibility and potentially lead to a successful conclusion in the next few rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $1,275,000 for it. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,275,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,275,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:**  Bob's offer of $1,275,000 is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Limited time remaining:** We are nearing the end of the negotiation process with only 4 rounds remaining. 
* **John's offer is secure:** I have a guaranteed buyer in John who is willing to pay my minimum price.

**Strategy:**

While I appreciate Bob's willingness to negotiate, his offer is still too far below my desired price. With limited rounds remaining, I can afford to take a chance and potentially get closer to my desired price with a counteroffer. However, I'm aware that if the negotiation fails, I can easily sell the product to John for my minimum price."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're still trying to find a price that works for you. With only a few rounds left, let's try to reach a fair deal. I'm willing to come down to $1,325,000, which is halfway between our last two offers.  This shows my commitment to reaching an agreement, and it's a price that would still be beneficial for both of us.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1325000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final compromise:** With only a few rounds left, I'm offering a price that's a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's last offer. 
* **Emphasis on fair deal:** I'm using language like ""fair deal"" and ""beneficial for both of us"" to highlight the potential for a mutually agreeable outcome.
* **Show commitment:** I'm expressing my commitment to reaching an agreement to encourage Bob to do the same.

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer is a final attempt to find common ground and reach a deal.  It's a slightly lower offer than before, but it still maintains a price above my minimum acceptable value. I'm hoping that Bob will see the value in reaching an agreement and accept this final offer. If not, I'm confident that I can still sell the product to John for my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for it. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is running out:** There are only two rounds left, and Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **John's offer is guaranteed:**  I have a guaranteed buyer in John who is willing to pay my minimum price.
* **Risk of further negotiation:**  There's a risk that Bob might continue to lowball me in the next round, and I don't want to waste valuable time with a potentially unsuccessful negotiation.

**Strategy:**

Given the time constraint and the certainty of John's offer, it's more advantageous to sell to John and secure my minimum price. This avoids further negotiation with Bob, who has proven to be unwilling to meet my desired price."
