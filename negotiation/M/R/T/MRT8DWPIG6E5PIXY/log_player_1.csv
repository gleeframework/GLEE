Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering its worth to both of us. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 1350000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed buyer at $1,500,000, aiming higher with Bob could yield a better return.
* **Finding Middle Ground:** The price of $1,350,000 sits comfortably between Bob's valuation ($1,200,000) and mine (at least $1,500,000). This makes it more likely Bob will find the offer acceptable.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** There's a chance Bob might counter-offer. Starting at $1,350,000 provides some flexibility to potentially negotiate a slightly lower price while still remaining above my minimum.
* **Confidence and Value:** The message emphasizes the product's value, aiming to justify the price and increase Bob's perceived worth of the item."
