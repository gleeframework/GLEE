"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential, I'm proposing an initial price of $1,100,000.

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think the price is a bit high. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value and my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand your perspective on the value.  However, the price you're suggesting doesn't reflect the true potential of this product. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,050,000. I believe this is a strong offer that still allows you a significant return on your investment.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for considering my previous offer, Alice. I'm still interested in the product, but I'm not willing to go up to $1,050,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $950,000. I believe this is a fair price that balances the value of the product with my budget.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Let's find a middle ground.  While $950,000 is still below what I value the product at, I'm willing to accept that price if we can agree on a shorter payment timeframe. Would you be open to making the full payment within [insert specific, shorter timeframe here, e.g., 30 days]?",950000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm open to discussing a shorter payment timeframe, Alice. However, I'm not comfortable committing to a 30-day payment period. I'm willing to make a payment within 60 days, but I'm still looking to get the price down to $900,000. Would you be willing to meet me at $900,000 with a 60-day payment plan?",900000.0,Bob,6,
