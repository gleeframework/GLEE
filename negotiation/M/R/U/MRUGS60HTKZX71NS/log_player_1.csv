Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a great deal, and I believe it's worth every penny. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than your minimum:** $11,500 is above your minimum of $10,000, so you're already making a profit.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** You're not asking for the full $12,000, giving Bob room to negotiate and feel like he's getting a good deal. 
* **It's a strong starting point:** This price demonstrates your confidence in the product's value.

Let's see how Bob reacts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $11,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'd be willing to pay $10,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is above your minimum of $10,000, it's still significantly lower than your desired price.  It's worth attempting another round of negotiation to see if you can reach a more favorable agreement.  There's a chance Bob may be willing to go slightly higher than $10,500."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $10,500 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, though. How about $11,000? It's still a great deal for you, and it's closer to what I need. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** This counteroffer shows willingness to compromise while still maintaining a decent profit margin.
* **Value Emphasis:** The message re-emphasizes the product's value, encouraging Bob to reconsider.
* **Clear Next Step:** This counteroffer presents a clear and concise option for Bob, prompting a response."
