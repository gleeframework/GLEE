"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a great deal, and I believe it's worth every penny. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $11,500 is a better deal than John's offer, Bob can likely get a better price by counter-offering.  He has room to negotiate since the product is only worth $10,000 to Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $11,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'd be willing to pay $10,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $10,500 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, though. How about $11,000? It's still a great deal for you, and it's closer to what I need. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save money. Alice's offer of $11,000 is still better than buying from John for $12,000.  While Bob could continue to negotiate, there's a risk that Alice will refuse further offers and he'll be forced to buy from John at a higher price.  Accepting this offer ensures a good deal and avoids potential further negotiation headaches."
