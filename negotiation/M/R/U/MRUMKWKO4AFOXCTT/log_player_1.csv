Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am looking to keep my investment within $7,000. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $7,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json

While $7,500 is more than my minimum, it's still below what I'm aiming for. I'll try to negotiate a better price with Bob in the next round."
