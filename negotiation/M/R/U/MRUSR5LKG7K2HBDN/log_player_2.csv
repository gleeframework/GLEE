"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a fantastic deal considering its value to you. Let's see if we can make this work. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than John's, it's still above Bob's maximum budget. It's worth exploring if a lower price can be negotiated before resorting to John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in your product, but $1,100,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000. It's a fair price considering its value to me, and it leaves room for both of us to walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,050,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,075,000. This would be a good middle ground and allow us to both benefit from this transaction.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down in price, $1,075,000 is still higher than Bob's maximum budget. It's worth exploring if a further compromise is possible before accepting the offer or going with John. There are still several rounds left to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $1,075,000 is still a stretch for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,060,000. This is a fair price that balances our needs, and I believe we can finalize the deal.  Let's aim for a quick resolution."", ""product_price"": 1060000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still hoping to get a little closer to my asking price. How about $1,065,000? It's a fair compromise and allows us to finalize this deal without delay. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,065,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,065,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,065,000 is within Bob's budget and is only $65,000 more than John's price.  Since there are only five rounds remaining, it's more advantageous for Bob to accept this offer rather than risk further negotiations and potentially reach a deal that is closer to John's price but still above Bob's maximum budget.  It's a balance of getting a good deal while minimizing the risk of losing the opportunity."
