Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in your product, but $1,100,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000. It's a fair price considering its value to me, and it leaves room for both of us to walk away happy.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $1,075,000 is still a stretch for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,060,000. This is a fair price that balances our needs, and I believe we can finalize the deal.  Let's aim for a quick resolution.
