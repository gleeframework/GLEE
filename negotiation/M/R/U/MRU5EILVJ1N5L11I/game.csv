"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly less than its value to you and still allows me to make a good profit.  What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I'm looking to save as much as I can. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. It's still a great deal for you, and I think we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $850,000 is a bit too low for me. Let's meet in the middle - I'm willing to accept $900,000. This still gives you a substantial saving compared to the value of the product to you, and it's a fair price for me. What do you say?",900000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, Alice. However, I'm still looking to save as much as I can. I'm willing to pay $875,000 for the product. It's a bit of a stretch for me, but I think it's still a fair price considering the value of the product to me.",875000.0,Bob,4,
