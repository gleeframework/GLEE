I'm starting with a price of $20,000. This is a bit higher than my minimum value, leaving room for negotiation.  Since I don't know Bob's value for the product, I want to start high and see if he's willing to pay a premium."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $18,000.
