Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm about the product.  While I see the value it offers, $900,000 is still a bit high for me at this time.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it, which is still a good deal for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.
