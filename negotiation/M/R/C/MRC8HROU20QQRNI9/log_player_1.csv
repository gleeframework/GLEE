Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value of the product, $14,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $11,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While it's tempting, I'm confident I can get closer to my target price.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $11,000 is just a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $12,500? I believe that's a fair price considering the value you place on the product."", ""product_price"": 12500}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need a price that works for you, but $12,500 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $12,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the value of the product to both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
