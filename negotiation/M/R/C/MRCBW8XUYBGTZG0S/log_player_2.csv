**Explanation:**

* **Bob's goal:** Save as much money as possible.
* **Alice's offer:** $950,000
* **John's offer:** $1,000,000
* **Analysis:** While Alice's offer is better than John's, Bob can still do better by rejecting Alice's offer and negotiating further.  

**Reasoning:**

Bob knows the product is worth $800,000 to Alice, meaning Alice has a significant margin for negotiation. By rejecting Alice's offer, Bob signals his willingness to pay less and potentially pushes Alice to lower her price. It's always beneficial to try and negotiate further, especially when there's a clear difference in valuation."
