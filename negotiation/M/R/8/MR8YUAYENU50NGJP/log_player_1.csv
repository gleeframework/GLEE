Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm definitely interested in the product, but $1,300,000 is a bit too high for me right now. Would you consider coming down to $1,100,000? I think that would be a fair price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000

I understand that $1,300,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is already a significant discount from my original price, and I'm not sure I'm willing to go any lower. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1200000}"
