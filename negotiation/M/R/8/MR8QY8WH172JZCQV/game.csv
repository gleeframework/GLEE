"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable.  Given its potential worth to someone with your expertise, I'm proposing an initial price of $1,400,000.  I'm confident this is a fair starting point for discussions, and I'm open to hearing your thoughts.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,300,000. I believe this price is more in line with the value I can get from the product.",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate you countering and engaging in this discussion.  While I understand your perspective on the value, I believe my initial offer is closer to its true potential given the benefits it offers. Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $1,350,000?",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still not convinced that $1,350,000 is the right price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'm thinking of $1,325,000. I'm trying to find a mutually beneficial price, but I need to stay within my budget.",1325000.0,Bob,4,
