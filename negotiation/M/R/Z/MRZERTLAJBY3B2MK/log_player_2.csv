"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $10,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer is $2,000 over your maximum budget. 
* It's always worth negotiating to see if you can get a better price. 
* You have 10 rounds, so there's plenty of time to try and reach a mutually acceptable agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you reaching out. While I'm interested, $10,000 is a bit out of my budget. Would you consider $8,500? I'm confident we can find a deal that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* This counteroffer starts by acknowledging Alice's offer, building a positive tone.
* It clearly states your budget constraint, making it clear you're serious about negotiation.
* The offer is a reasonable starting point, only $500 below Alice's value, leaving room for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your perspective on the price. While $10,000 reflects the true value of this product, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $9,250? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's counteroffer is still above my maximum budget of $8,000. 
* While she's shown some flexibility, I believe there's room for further negotiation.
* I'll counteroffer again, aiming to close the gap further and potentially reach a mutually acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. $9,250 is closer, but still a bit above my budget. How about $8,750?  I'm really keen on acquiring this product, and I believe this price is fair considering our negotiation."", ""product_price"": 8750}
```

**Reasoning:**

* I'm continuing to show flexibility by moving closer to Alice's price.
* My counteroffer is still within my budget and represents a significant reduction from her previous offer. 
* The message emphasizes my interest in the product to create a sense of urgency and willingness to reach a deal."
