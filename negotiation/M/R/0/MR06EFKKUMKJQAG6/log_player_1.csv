Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your product is certainly valuable, but $1,150,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this moment. Given my budget and the product's worth to me, I'm willing to offer $1,050,000. I believe this price is fair, reflecting the value of the product while allowing us both to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000

However, I must respectfully decline your offer at $1,050,000. We are committed to maintaining a fair market value for our product, and based on its worth, we are unable to accept a lower price at this time. I would like to propose an alternative at $1,100,000.
