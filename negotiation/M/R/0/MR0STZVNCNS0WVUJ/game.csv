"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer.  However, $8,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This is a fair price, considering the value of the product to you. Let's meet in the middle.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $8,500 and $9,000. Can you do $8,750?",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. How about $8,900?  This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's still a good value for you given the product's worth. Let's make this happen.",8900.0,Alice,5,
