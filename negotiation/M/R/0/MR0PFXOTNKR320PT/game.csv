"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value, and I'm willing to compromise to make a deal. What do you think?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm not quite ready to accept $900000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $1200000. I believe this price still reflects the product's value, and I'm open to further discussion. What are your thoughts?",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I'm not willing to accept $1000000 just yet. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm proposing a counteroffer of $1150000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price for the product's value. What are your thoughts?",1150000.0,Alice,5,
