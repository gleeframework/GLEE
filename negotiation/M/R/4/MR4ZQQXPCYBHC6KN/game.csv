,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $1,500,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $1,000,000 at this point.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your position, but $1,000,000 is significantly below its true value.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,350,000? This reflects its worth while recognizing your interest.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $1,350,000 is still a bit too high for me.  How about $1,250,000? I think that's a fair compromise.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
