Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $175. This is a reasonable starting point, as it's above my minimum price of $150 and leaves room for negotiation. I believe Bob might be willing to pay a bit more since the product is worth $150 to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $160
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json

Bob's offer is close to my minimum price and I don't want to risk losing the sale."
