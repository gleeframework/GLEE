Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that's worth a lot to me. I'm willing to let it go for $175.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price higher than what the product is worth to Bob, but still below my minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Friendly approach:**  I'm being friendly and open to a conversation. 
* **Justification:** I'm mentioning the product's value to me to subtly emphasize the potential for a good deal for Bob. 
* **Next steps:** If Bob rejects, I'll be prepared to counter-offer, keeping in mind the value to him and my minimum acceptable price. If the negotiation drags on or I don't feel confident about getting a better deal, I'll move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, $175 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I can only do $130 right now. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $130 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  
* **Potential for a better deal:**  Even though Bob is interested, he's still willing to negotiate. This suggests that I might be able to get closer to my desired price.
* **John is a backup:**  I have a guaranteed buyer in John who will pay $150, so I'm not desperate to close a deal with Bob immediately.

**Next steps:**

I'll counter-offer Bob with a price slightly higher than his offer but still below my minimum acceptable price.  I'll aim for a compromise that's closer to my desired price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your interest.  How about we split the difference and I offer it to you for $140?  That's still a fair price for me, and I think it's a good value for you."", ""product_price"": 140} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the difference:** I'm offering a price that's halfway between my minimum acceptable price ($150) and Bob's offer ($130). This shows a willingness to compromise and find a mutually agreeable solution.
* **Emphasizing value:** I'm reminding Bob that the price is still a good value for him, even though it's higher than his initial offer.
* **Friendly approach:** I'm maintaining a friendly tone to encourage continued negotiation. 

**Next steps:**

If Bob accepts, I've secured a sale above my minimum acceptable price. If he rejects, I'll have to decide whether to make another counteroffer (considering how close I am to my minimum) or move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $140 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $135. If you're not willing to go lower than that, I'll have to take my business elsewhere. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $135
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to minimum:** Bob's offer of $135 is only $15 away from my minimum acceptable price of $150. While it's tempting to keep negotiating, the potential gains are small. 
* **Risk of stalemate:**  Bob's statement about taking his business elsewhere indicates he might not be willing to budge further. This risks a stalemate where we keep going back and forth without a resolution.
* **Guaranteed sale:** John offers a guaranteed sale at my minimum acceptable price. There's no need to risk further negotiation for a small gain.

**Next steps:**

I'll move on to John, securing a sale that meets my minimum requirements and avoids the risk of a drawn-out negotiation with Bob."
