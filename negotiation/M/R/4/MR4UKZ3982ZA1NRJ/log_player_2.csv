"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this incredible product from me. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1000000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm only willing to sell it to you at this price because I value our potential partnership. If you're interested, please let me know and we can discuss the details. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's.**  You're willing to pay up to $1,500,000, and Alice is offering it for $1,000,000. This saves you $500,000.
* **Even though you could potentially negotiate with Alice, there's no guarantee you'll get a better price.**  The risk of losing the product to John is greater than the potential savings."
