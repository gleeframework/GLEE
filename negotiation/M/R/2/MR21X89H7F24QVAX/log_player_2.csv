"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,000. It's a great deal for both of us! What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

It's not a good deal for Bob. He should reject the offer and make a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, $9,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $7,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 7500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $8,250? That would be a fair compromise, wouldn't you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

While $8,250 is closer to Bob's target price, it's still above his maximum.  John offers a guaranteed deal at Bob's limit, so it's the most sensible choice to avoid further negotiation."
