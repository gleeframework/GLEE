Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to buy this product for $110. I believe it will be highly valuable to you."", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Value:** You know Bob values the product at $120, giving you room to negotiate above your minimum price ($80) and John's offer ($80).
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $110 leaves a small margin for Bob to potentially negotiate a slightly lower price while still ensuring a significant profit for you.
* **Direct and Clear Communication:** The message is clear about the product's value and your desired price. 

This strategy aims to maximize your profit while still making the offer attractive to Bob."
