"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its worth, I'm proposing a starting price of $15,000. I believe this reflects its true value, but I'm open to discussing further.",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $15,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $8,000 for it. Let me know what you think.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest and counter-offer.  While I understand your perspective on the price, $8,000 is significantly below its true value. I could consider letting it go for $13,000. This feels like a fair compromise. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $13,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. How about we split the difference and settle on $11,500? I really want this product, and I believe this is a fair price for both of us.",11500.0,Bob,4,
