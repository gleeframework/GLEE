"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer, but leaving room for negotiation.  I'm confident that Bob will find this price attractive, as it's still significantly less than the product is worth to him.  I'm also leaving some room to potentially negotiate downwards if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still lower than what I'm hoping for, but it's a good sign that he's willing to negotiate. I'm going to reject this offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

I'm lowering my offer slightly, but still maintaining a price that is higher than Bob's offer. This shows him that I'm willing to compromise, but I'm still confident in the value of my product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  While it's getting closer to my minimum, I believe I can still get a better deal with further negotiation. The risk of selling to John is still greater than the potential of getting a better offer from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

I'm lowering my offer again, but still leaving some room for negotiation.  I'm getting closer to Bob's price, but I'm confident that I can still get a better deal.  I'm hoping that he'll realize that he's getting a great deal and be willing to accept this price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  It's getting close to my minimum, but I still believe I can get a better deal with further negotiation.  The risk of selling to John is still greater than the potential of getting a better offer from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1175000}
```

I'm getting closer to Bob's offer but still leaving some room for him to compromise. I'm confident that this offer is a good compromise and that Bob will see the value of closing the deal at this price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

At this point, Bob's offers are getting too low and I've exhausted my options for negotiation.  I've only got 2 rounds left, and I'm not confident that I can get a better deal.  Even though selling to John means getting less than I'd like, it's a better option than continuing to negotiate with Bob and risking getting an even worse offer."
