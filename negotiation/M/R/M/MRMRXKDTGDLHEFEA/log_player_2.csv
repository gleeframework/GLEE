**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:** Alice is offering the product for $1,300,000, which is significantly lower than John's price of $1,500,000. 
* **You can still make a profit:** Even at $1,300,000, you are buying the product for less than your maximum budget of $1,500,000. 
* **It's a good deal:** While Alice's offer is still more than what she values the product at ($800,000), it's a good deal for you and saves you $200,000 compared to buying from John."
