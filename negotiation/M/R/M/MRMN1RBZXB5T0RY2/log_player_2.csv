"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique and valuable opportunity to acquire this exceptional product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll find it worth every penny. I'm offering it to you for $20000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $20,000 is significantly higher than his maximum budget of $10,000. He should try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $20,000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for it.  Let me know if that's something you'd consider."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $10000 is below my target, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to consider a price of $18000, which is a significant discount from my initial offer. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's a significant discount from her initial offer, $18,000 is still more than Bob is willing to pay. It's worth trying to negotiate further and see if Alice will go lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $18,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $15,000, which is a fair compromise. I'm eager to get this product, but it needs to fit within my budget. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 15000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal, Bob. I can see that you're willing to go up to $15000, but I'm still not sure if that's enough for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to get closer to my target. How about we try $16500? It's a compromise that should work for both of us, don't you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While she's getting closer to his desired price, $16,500 is still higher than his ideal budget. He should continue negotiating and try to get her lower.  There's a good chance she'll accept a counteroffer closer to $15,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, we're getting closer. While $16,500 is tempting, I'm still a bit stretched. I'm prepared to offer $14,000.  It's a fair price that reflects our compromise and allows both of us to get what we want.  Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 14000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but $14000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway one more time, but I need to get closer to my target. How about we try $17000? It's a compromise that should work for both of us, and I'm willing to give you a slight discount from my previous offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should buy the product from John for $10,000.  Alice is not budging much on her price, and it's clear she's not willing to go down to Bob's desired price. At this point, it's more beneficial to take the guaranteed price from John and avoid further negotiations."
