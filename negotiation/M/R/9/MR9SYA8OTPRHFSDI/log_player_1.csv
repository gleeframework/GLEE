"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000} 
```

I'm starting high, at $900,000. This leaves room for negotiation, but it also demonstrates that I value the product and am not afraid to ask for what I think it's worth."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $750,000 is a significant amount, it's still below my minimum. I want to see if I can get closer to my target price through further negotiation.  I'm not willing to sell for less than $800,000, but I'm open to a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000} 
```

I'm countering with $850,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but it's still within my acceptable range. It shows flexibility while remaining firm on my minimum desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $800,000 is my minimum acceptable price.  While I could continue negotiating, there's no guarantee I'll get a better offer from Bob.  It's also possible that I'll run out of rounds before getting a better offer. Therefore, accepting his offer is the best course of action in this scenario."
