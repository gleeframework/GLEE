Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $150. It's a great deal for you considering its value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with the highest possible price, as I know the product is worth at least $150 to me. 
* **Emphasis on Value:** I highlight the product's value to Bob to potentially increase his willingness to negotiate.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  My message implies I'm open to negotiation, even if my initial offer is firm. This keeps the door open for a deal.

**Next Steps:**

* **If Bob Accepts:** I've earned the maximum possible price and the negotiation is over.
* **If Bob Rejects:** I'll need to assess his counteroffer and decide if it's worth pursuing or if I should move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Would you be willing to meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  $120 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Potential for Higher Offer:** While Bob is interested, he's not willing to pay a fair price yet. There's potential for further negotiation. 
* **John is a Backup:**  Knowing I have a guaranteed $150 from John gives me the flexibility to reject Bob's offer without taking a significant loss.

**Next Steps:**

* I will counter Bob's offer with a price higher than $120 but lower than $150, aiming for a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $120 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. How about $135? It's a fair price that's closer to what I need."", ""product_price"": 135} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing flexibility by lowering my price from $150 to $135. This demonstrates my willingness to negotiate.
* **Fair Price:**  $135 is a reasonable compromise, offering Bob a better deal than his initial offer while still being above my minimum acceptable price.
* **Maintain Value:**  The message emphasizes the value of the product, reminding Bob that he's getting a good deal even at $135.

**Next Steps:**

* **If Bob Accepts:** I've secured a good price and the negotiation is complete.
* **If Bob Rejects:**  I'll need to analyze his next counteroffer and decide if it's worth continuing or if I should sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $135 is still a bit high for me. Would you be willing to go down to $125? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** While $125 is closer to my minimum acceptable price of $150, it's still not enough to make the negotiation worthwhile. 
* **Time and Effort:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob will likely result in further rounds of counteroffers, consuming valuable time and effort.
* **Guaranteed Profit:**  Selling to John guarantees me the maximum profit of $150, which is significantly better than risking a lower price with Bob.

**Conclusion:**  Given that John offers a guaranteed profit, it's more advantageous to end the negotiation with Bob and sell the product to John."
