"Bob, I have a fantastic product I think you'd be interested in. It's worth at least $1,500,000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a great opportunity to acquire a valuable asset at a significantly lower price.  Consider it carefully, as I have another buyer lined up who's willing to pay full price.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
