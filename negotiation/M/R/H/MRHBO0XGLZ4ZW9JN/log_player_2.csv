"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1400000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's worth to you is $1200000. I believe this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

```

**Reasoning:**

You can get the product from John for $1,200,000, and Alice is currently offering it for $1,400,000. There's room for negotiation. It's better to reject the offer and try to get a better price from Alice."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $1250000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1325000. This is a compromise that I think is fair, considering the product's value to you is $1200000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to your desired price, but there's still room for negotiation. You can still get the product from John for $1,200,000, so rejecting Alice's offer and counter-offering again is the best strategy to try and get a better deal."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $1300000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer $1285000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to me is $1500000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,285,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is now offering $1,285,000, which is still higher than what you can get from John for $1,200,000.  There's no guarantee that further negotiation with Alice will result in a lower price, and the risk of her rejecting your counteroffer and increasing the price again is high.  It's more advantageous to buy from John at this point and avoid any further risk."
