"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this excellent product. I think it would be incredibly beneficial for you.  I'm asking for $14,000 for it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
This is the best initial move.  $14,000 is well above your budget, and you can likely get a better price by negotiating with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  $14,000 is a bit out of my price range.  I'm very interested in the product, but I can only offer $10,500.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 10500}
``` 

This counteroffer starts the negotiation by showing Alice that you are serious about buying but also establishes your budget. Offering $10,500 is a significant reduction from her initial price, but it is still more than what you are willing to pay from John. This gives Alice room to negotiate but also shows her you are serious about getting a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,500 is too low for me.  Could you meet me halfway at $12,250? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $12,250 is closer to your budget, it's still above your maximum of $10,000.  There's still room for negotiation, and you can potentially get a better deal by continuing to counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I understand your position, but $12,250 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $11,000, which is closer to our middle ground.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 
This counteroffer is a further compromise, demonstrating your willingness to negotiate while staying within your budget. It shows Alice that you are serious about buying the product but are still looking for a good deal."
