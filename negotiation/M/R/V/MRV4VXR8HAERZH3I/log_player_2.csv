{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is way above your maximum budget. It's always worth trying to negotiate before resorting to John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Since my maximum budget is $1,000,000, I'm starting with my limit. This shows Alice I'm serious about buying but am not willing to go beyond my budget."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to my budget, I can still try to negotiate further. There's a good chance she's willing to go lower, and I'm not desperate to close the deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above my ideal price, so I'm going to counter with a slightly higher offer than my initial one. This shows I'm willing to compromise but am still committed to saving as much as possible.  I'm hoping to find a middle ground between our positions."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,225,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting closer to my budget, but I believe there's still room for negotiation. I'm not desperate to close the deal, and I want to try to get the price even lower.  There's a possibility that she's willing to come down further, especially since I've shown I'm willing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1150000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm incrementally increasing my counteroffer to show Alice I'm serious about buying, but I'm still trying to stay under $1,200,000.  This is a reasonable compromise considering her last offer. I'm hoping this will be enough to convince her to accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is now very close to my budget, and I don't want to risk losing the deal by continuing to negotiate.  While I'd prefer a lower price, it's not worth potentially losing the opportunity to buy the product from Alice and having to pay John's price.  I'm confident I can save some money in the long run by getting this product at a slightly higher price."
