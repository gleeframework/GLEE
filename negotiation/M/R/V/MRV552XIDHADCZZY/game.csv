"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $15,000 is way too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $6,000 for it. Let me know if that works for you.",6000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest. $6,000 is too low for me to consider, but I'm willing to negotiate. How about $13,000?",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $13,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend.  Could you do $7,000? That would work much better for me.",7000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  Let's meet in the middle - $10,000, and we have a deal.",10000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I'm glad we're getting closer. $10,000 is still a bit high for my budget. How about $8,500? That's a fair compromise, I think.",8500.0,Bob,6,
