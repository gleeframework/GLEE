"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $11,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $13,000 is my final offer. If you're still interested, let's make this happen.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your position, but $13,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'm offering $12,500. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price.",12500.0,Bob,4,
