"Alice,  while I appreciate your offer,  $1,100,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to offer $900,000 for the product. This reflects the value I see in it, and I believe it's a fair starting point for us to negotiate from.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  I understand your perspective on the value.  To be fair to both of us, I could meet you halfway between our offers. How about we settle on $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,000,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $950,000. This is a significant compromise, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.",950000.0,Bob,4,
