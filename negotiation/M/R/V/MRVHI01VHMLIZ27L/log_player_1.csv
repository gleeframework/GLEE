Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  while I appreciate your offer,  $1,100,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to offer $900,000 for the product. This reflects the value I see in it, and I believe it's a fair starting point for us to negotiate from.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,000,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $950,000. This is a significant compromise, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.

While Bob is showing some willingness to negotiate, his offers are increasing in relatively small increments. It's unlikely he'll reach a price that's significantly closer to my minimum, and I risk leaving money on the table by continuing to haggle. John offers a guaranteed $1,200,000 which is a significant amount more.  It makes the most business sense to take the guaranteed offer."
