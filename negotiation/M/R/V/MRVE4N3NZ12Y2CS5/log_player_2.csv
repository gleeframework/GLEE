{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's but not the best you can get.** You can still get a better price by rejecting Alice's offer and hoping she counters with a lower price.
* **Negotiation:** By rejecting the offer, you open the possibility for further negotiation with Alice, potentially leading to a price closer to her $800,000 valuation."
