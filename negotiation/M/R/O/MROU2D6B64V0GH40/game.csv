"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're looking to spend closer to $750000, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $825000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and uniqueness. I'm confident you'll find it a great investment.",825000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a fair price, and I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, I still think the product's value is worth more than $800000. I'm willing to compromise and offer it to you for $815000. This is a slight increase from my previous offer, but I believe it's still a reasonable price considering the product's uniqueness and potential returns.",815000.0,Alice,5,
