Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to show you this amazing product that I think you'll love. I'm willing to offer it to you for $18000. It's a fantastic deal, and I think you'll find it's worth every penny. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice's offer is far too high.  Bob should reject the offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your initial offer was a bit high for me. I'm really interested in this product, but I'm only willing to pay $8,000 for it. Let's see if we can work something out."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $8000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of a price of $14000. It's a fair middle ground, and I think you'll find it's still a great deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $14,000 is a step in the right direction, it's still above Bob's maximum budget. He should continue negotiating and try to push for a lower price."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $14,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm really hoping to stay within my budget of $8,000.  Would you be willing to consider a price closer to that? "", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $12500. It's a fair compromise, and I think you'll find it's still a great deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your efforts to find a middle ground, but $12,500 is still outside my budget. I'm confident that we can reach a fair price that works for both of us. I'm willing to pay $10,000. Let's see if we can make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to be flexible, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10000. I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'm thinking of a price of $11500. It's a fair price, and I think you'll find it's still a great deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's offer of $11,500 is still too high for Bob.  He's running out of rounds and doesn't want to risk Alice rejecting his next counteroffer. It's safer to buy from John at his set price of $8,000."
