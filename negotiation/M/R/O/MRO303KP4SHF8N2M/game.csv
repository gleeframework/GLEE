"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000.  It's a great deal for both of us, as you'll be getting it for less than its worth to you, and I'll still be getting a good price. Let me know what you think!",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested, but $1,100,000 is a bit high for me.  Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $900,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $1,000,000?  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure you'll find it a great value for your business. ",1000000.0,Alice,3,
