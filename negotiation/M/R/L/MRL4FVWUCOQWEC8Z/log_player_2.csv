Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $900,000 is significantly below what I'm willing to accept.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This price still reflects the value of the product, but it's a more realistic figure for both of us. Let's see if we can find a compromise.
