I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,500,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. 

Here's my reasoning:

* **High potential value:**  I don't know Bob's valuation, so there's a chance he might be willing to pay a lot more than my minimum. 
* **No downside:** If Bob rejects, I can still sell to John for my minimum, so there's no risk in offering a higher price. 
* **Negotiation leverage:** Starting high gives me room to negotiate downwards if Bob counters with a lower offer. 

Let's see what Bob thinks!"
