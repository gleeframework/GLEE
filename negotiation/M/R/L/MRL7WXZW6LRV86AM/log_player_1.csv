"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price significantly higher than my minimum value ($10,000). This allows room for negotiation and potentially maximizing my earnings.
* **Gauging Interest:** This first offer will help me understand Bob's level of interest and potential willingness to pay. 
* **Alternative Option:** I'm aware of John's offer, so I'm not afraid to walk away if Bob's offers become unreasonable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Room for Negotiation:** Bob's offer is closer to my minimum value but still leaves room for me to potentially get a better price.
* **Potential for Higher Offer:**  By rejecting this offer, I can attempt to negotiate a higher price in the subsequent rounds.
* **Maintaining Leverage:**  I'm not desperate to sell and have the option of selling to John as a safety net."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** My counteroffer splits the difference between my initial offer and Bob's offer. This demonstrates a willingness to compromise while still aiming for a price closer to my desired range. 
* **Testing the Waters:** This counteroffer will further gauge Bob's willingness to pay, potentially leading to a quicker agreement.
* **Maintaining Flexibility:** If Bob rejects this offer, I can adjust my next counteroffer based on his response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Target:** Bob's offer is now very close to my desired price range. 
* **Limited Rounds:** We are already in round 4, leaving fewer opportunities to negotiate further. 
* **Risk of Lower Price:** Rejecting this offer might lead to a lower counteroffer from Bob or a decision to sell to John at a significantly lower price. 
* **Time is Money:** Accepting this offer ensures a quick and profitable sale."
