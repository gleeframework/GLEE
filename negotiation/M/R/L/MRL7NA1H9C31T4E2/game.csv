"Alice, your offer is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $10,000. This is my maximum budget, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value I place on the product.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $20,000 is already a competitive price for this product.  To move things along, I'm willing to come down to $17,000. This is my final offer.",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $17,000 is still a bit more than I can comfortably pay.  I'm willing to go up to $12,000. If you're open to that, we can make a deal.  Otherwise, I might have to look elsewhere.",12000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, it seems like we're getting closer.  I'm willing to accept $15,000 for the product. This is a significant discount from my initial offer and reflects my desire to find a fair resolution. ",15000.0,Alice,5,
