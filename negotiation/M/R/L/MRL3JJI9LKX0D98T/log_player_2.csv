Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective on the price. However, $1,000,000 is significantly below its true value. I could be persuaded to let it go for $1,350,000. This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the product's worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, you're getting closer! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,175,000 is tempting, I'm still confident this product is worth more. Let's land on $1,275,000 and call it a deal. This price reflects the value while acknowledging your efforts in this negotiation. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,275,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,275,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** While Alice is getting closer to a reasonable price, it's clear she's aiming to stay above $1,200,000. At this point, it's more beneficial to cut our losses and buy from John. We've gained information about Alice's potential price floor, but further negotiation might not yield significant savings."
