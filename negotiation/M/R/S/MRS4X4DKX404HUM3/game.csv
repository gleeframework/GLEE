"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $1,000,000. Let's make this happen.",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $800,000. I'm willing to make a serious investment in this product, but I need to make sure it's within my budget. Can we meet in the middle at $825,000?",825000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $825,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to stay above $900,000 to make this worthwhile.  How about $925,000?  This allows for a fair deal for both of us.",925000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down from $950,000 to $925,000, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from $825,000, which was my previous offer, and $925,000, which is your current offer. How about we meet at $875,000?",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming up to $875,000, but I'm still a bit off from where I need to be.  Let's split the difference between your last offer and my previous offer. How about $900,000? This would be a fair compromise, and I'm willing to accept it.",900000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand that we're close, but $900,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $875,000, but I think we can do better than that. How about we try $857,500? This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm willing to meet you halfway from $825,000 to $925,000",857500.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I need to stay above $875,000. How about we meet in the middle of our last two offers at $891,250? This seems like a reasonable compromise, considering the value of the product for both of us.",891250.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, I understand that we're getting close, but $891,250 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $875,000, but I think we can do better than that. I'll make a serious offer of $860,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm willing to meet you halfway from $825,000 to $925,000",860000.0,Bob,8,
