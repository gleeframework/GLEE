"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential, I believe a starting price of $1,100,000 feels fair. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:**  $1,100,000 is above your maximum budget of $1,200,000.
* **Negotiation is worthwhile:** You can likely get a better price by rejecting Alice's initial offer and making a counteroffer. 
* **John's offer is a safety net:**  Knowing you can buy from John for $1,200,000 gives you leverage to negotiate a lower price with Alice."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your perspective. While $950,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.  This feels like a fair compromise that recognizes the value this product brings. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still high:** While she has lowered the price, $1,050,000 is still above your desired price point.
* **More negotiation is possible:** Alice is willing to negotiate, and you can likely get closer to your target price with another counteroffer.
* **John's offer remains a fallback:**  Having John's offer as a safety net gives you leverage to push for a lower price from Alice."
