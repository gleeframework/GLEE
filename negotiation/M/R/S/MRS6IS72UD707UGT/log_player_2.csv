If you can't meet this price, I'll unfortunately need to explore other options."", ""product_price"": 800000}"

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your honesty about your budget constraints. I've been trying to find a price that works for both of us. To be completely transparent, I have another buyer who's prepared to pay $1,500,000 for this product. However, I value our discussions and believe you'd be a great fit for this product.  So, I'm willing to make one final offer at $1,100,000. This is a significant compromise on my end and reflects my commitment to closing this deal with you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** 

Alice has made it clear she's aiming for a much higher price than your absolute maximum of $800,000. She's using negotiation tactics (mentioning another buyer) to try and push you closer to her desired price. Since you have the option to buy from John at your target price, it's no longer beneficial to continue negotiating with Alice."
