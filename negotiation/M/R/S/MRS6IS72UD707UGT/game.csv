"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I recognize the value of the product, your starting price is quite high for me. I'd be willing to consider a price closer to $500,000. What do you think?",500000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I understand your initial offer, the product's true value and potential warrant a higher price.  I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This reflects the product's unique capabilities and the significant return on investment you'll see.",1900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, we're still quite far apart on price. I'm serious about purchasing this product, but it needs to be at a price point that makes sense for me. I can go up to $700,000.  This is a significant investment on my part, and I hope it demonstrates my commitment to reaching a fair agreement.",700000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your commitment to this deal and your willingness to increase your offer. To meet you halfway, I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000. This offer reflects a considerable reduction on my part and acknowledges your interest while still recognizing the inherent value of this product. What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, thanks for your flexibility. While your offer is moving in the right direction, the gap is still too wide for me.  To be frank, I'm only comfortable going as high as $800,000 for this product.  This represents my absolute maximum budget. If you can't meet this price, I'll unfortunately need to explore other options.",800000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I appreciate your honesty about your budget constraints. I've been trying to find a price that works for both of us. To be completely transparent, I have another buyer who's prepared to pay $1,500,000 for this product. However, I value our discussions and believe you'd be a great fit for this product.  So, I'm willing to make one final offer at $1,100,000. This is a significant compromise on my end and reflects my commitment to closing this deal with you.",1100000.0,Alice,7,
