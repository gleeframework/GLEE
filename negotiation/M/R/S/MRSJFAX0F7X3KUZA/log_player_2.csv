"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase my product for $1,200,000. I know this is a valuable asset, and I believe this price is fair considering its worth to you.  Let me know if you're interested, as I have another buyer lined up at a higher price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","I will reject Alice's offer. Alice's price is too high for me, and I can get the product from John for $1,000,000, which is a better deal.
