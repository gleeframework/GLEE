"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $17,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident it will be worth every penny to you. What do you think?",17000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get at least $15,000 for this product. Let's meet in the middle at $14,000. That's a fair price for both of us.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're willing to come down, but $14,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $12,000 and $14,000. How about $13,000?",13000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $13,000 is still below my minimum price.  I'm willing to drop to $13,500. This is a good deal for both of us, as you're getting the product at a significant discount from my original offer. Let's close this deal.",13500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're willing to drop the price, but $13,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $13,200, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at that price?",13200.0,Bob,6,
