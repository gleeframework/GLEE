This offer starts at a price that's significantly higher than your minimum value, leaving room for negotiation while still aiming for a good profit.  It also includes a friendly message to encourage Bob to engage in the conversation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $20000 is way above my budget.  I'm really interested in this product, but I can only offer $8000 at this time. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

$8,000 is far below my minimum value of $15,000. I'll counter Bob's offer and see if we can find a compromise."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget. While $8,000 is below my minimum, I'm willing to come down to $12,000.  This is still a great deal for you, and it allows me to sell the product without losing too much. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 12000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  $12000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $9500.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to get the product without breaking the bank.  Let's close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

$9,500 is still below my minimum value of $15,000. I'll counter Bob's offer again, but I'm getting closer to selling to John if this doesn't work."
