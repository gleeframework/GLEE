Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you being willing to work with me. However, $10,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending.  I'm happy to pay $8,500 for the product. This would be a fair price for both of us, as it leaves some room for your profit while still fitting within my budget.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
