"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $10,000. This is a great deal, considering the product is worth $12,000 to me, and I'm willing to make a concession to work with you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's a good deal for Alice, it's still above Bob's maximum budget.  Bob has a better option to buy from John for $8,000, but should try to negotiate a lower price with Alice first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you being willing to work with me. However, $10,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending.  I'm happy to pay $8,500 for the product. This would be a fair price for both of us, as it leaves some room for your profit while still fitting within my budget."", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $9,500. This is a fair compromise, considering the product is worth $12,000 to me. I'm hoping we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $9,500 is closer to Bob's desired price, it's still above his budget. He can still get a better deal from John at $8,000.  However, Bob should try to negotiate further with Alice to see if he can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $9,500 is still a bit more than I'm willing to pay. How about $9,000? This would be a great deal for both of us, as it allows me to stay within my budget and you still get a decent profit."", ""product_price"": 9000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your desire to stay within your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $9,250. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's final offer of $9,250 is still above Bob's maximum budget. While he could continue negotiating, it's likely Alice won't budge further. It's now in Bob's best interest to buy the product from John for $8,000, ensuring he stays within his budget and gets the best possible deal."
