"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $10,000. This is a great deal, considering the product is worth $12,000 to me, and I'm willing to make a concession to work with you.",10000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you being willing to work with me. However, $10,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending.  I'm happy to pay $8,500 for the product. This would be a fair price for both of us, as it leaves some room for your profit while still fitting within my budget.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $9,500. This is a fair compromise, considering the product is worth $12,000 to me. I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",9500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $9,500 is still a bit more than I'm willing to pay. How about $9,000? This would be a great deal for both of us, as it allows me to stay within my budget and you still get a decent profit.",9000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your desire to stay within your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $9,250. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",9250.0,Alice,5,
