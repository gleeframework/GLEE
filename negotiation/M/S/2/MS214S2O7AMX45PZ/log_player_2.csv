It's always a good idea to see if you can get a better price.  You can try to negotiate a lower price with Alice before resorting to buying from John."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer to see if Alice is willing to negotiate seriously.  Let's see if we can find some common ground!"

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

I'm going to try a slightly higher counteroffer than before, but still significantly lower than Alice's current offer.  This shows that I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm also not going to just cave in to her demands."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice is getting closer to my desired price.  It's likely that I can't get a better deal, and it's better to accept her offer than risk losing out and having to buy from John at a higher price."
