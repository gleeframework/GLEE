"Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $140 is less than John's price, Bob can still potentially get a better deal.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and attempt to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a price that's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer. Offering $120 is a substantial counteroffer, giving Alice room to negotiate while still leaving Bob with a good deal compared to John's price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $130 is still a better deal for Bob compared to buying from John for $150.  While Bob could potentially negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice will walk away, forcing Bob to buy from John at a higher price.  Accepting the $130 offer ensures Bob gets the product at a price he's comfortable with, avoiding the risk of a higher cost."
