Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on this product. I think you'll find it very valuable. I'm willing to part with it for $119."", ""product_price"": 119}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  You want to get as close to Bob's maximum valuation ($120) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $119 gives Bob a slight discount while still securing a significant profit for you.  
* **Avoid a Counter Offer:** A slightly lower price might discourage Bob from countering, as it's already a good deal compared to his perceived value.
* **Secure a Better Outcome than John:** Offering it at $119 guarantees you a higher profit than selling to your backup buyer, John, for $100."
