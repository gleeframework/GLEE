"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $1,500,000. It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice to see if you can get a lower price.  You have 10 rounds, so you have time to explore options."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial price. This will give her a clear signal that I'm serious about negotiating and that I'm not willing to accept her first offer.  I'm leaving room for negotiation but also ensuring I stay within my budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above my budget, but it's getting closer. I'm going to reject this offer and try to get even closer to my target price by counteroffering again. There are still 7 rounds left, so I have time to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1450000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly from the last round, showing Alice that I'm willing to compromise.  $1,450,000 is still well within my budget and only $50,000 above John's offer.  If Alice rejects this offer, I'll be prepared to go back to John if the negotiations continue to stall."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,680,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,680,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high, but it's getting close to my budget.  I'm going to reject this offer and try to negotiate further to see if I can get a better price.  I have 5 rounds left, so there's still time to make a deal that works for me. I'm also considering that if I reject this offer, Alice might be more likely to accept a counteroffer closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1550000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm getting closer to my budget with this counteroffer. It's a significant jump from my previous offer, showing Alice that I'm serious about reaching a deal. I'm betting that she'll see this as a compromise and be willing to accept. If she rejects, I'm still within my budget to buy from John, but it's getting risky as we have only 4 rounds left."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,700,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

We're running out of time, and Alice's offer is still too high. I'm willing to pay a little more to secure the product and avoid any potential risks of further negotiations.  It's better to lock in the deal with John and ensure I get the product within my budget."
