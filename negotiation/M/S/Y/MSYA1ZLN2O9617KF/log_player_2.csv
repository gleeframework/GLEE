"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you might be interested in. It's something that's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you at a great price.  Let me know if you're interested and we can discuss the details. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","I'd like to reject Alice's offer. I can get the same product from John for $120, so paying $100 to Alice doesn't seem like a good deal to me.
