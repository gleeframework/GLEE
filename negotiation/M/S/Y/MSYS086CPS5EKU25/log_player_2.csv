"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $18000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $18,000 is significantly higher than his maximum budget of $10,000.  He should try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $18,000 is a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer price:** Bob offers $12,000, which is still above his maximum budget but significantly lower than Alice's initial offer. This shows he's serious about buying but needs a more reasonable price.
* **Message:** Bob politely acknowledges Alice's offer but expresses his budget constraints. This maintains a positive tone while clearly stating his position."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $12000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer it to you for $16000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's counteroffer is lower than her initial offer, it's still above Bob's budget. Bob should reject this offer and attempt to negotiate a lower price. He knows he can get the product for $10,000 from John, so he doesn't need to settle for a price higher than that."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $16,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is only $13,000. Would you be willing to consider that?"", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer price:** Bob again offers a price closer to his maximum budget, but still a bit lower than Alice's last offer. This shows he's serious about negotiating a fair price.
* **Message:**  Bob remains polite but firm, reaffirming his interest in the product while clearly stating his budget limitations. This keeps the conversation moving towards a potential agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad you're interested in the product, Bob! However, I'm still a bit far from your budget. I can offer it to you for $14500. It's a fair price, considering the product's value to you is $10000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer. Although it is lower than her previous offer, it is still above his budget.  He is better off buying from John at $10,000 and avoid further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm still not quite there. Given my budget, I'm only able to offer $11,000. I'm very interested in this product, and I hope we can find a way to make this work."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer price:** Bob is now offering $11,000, which is just $1,000 over his maximum budget but still significantly lower than Alice's offer. This shows he's trying to meet her halfway.
* **Message:**  Bob emphasizes his interest in the product and suggests a willingness to compromise. This keeps the negotiation open and encourages Alice to consider his offer. 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is taking a slight risk by offering a price above his maximum. However, he has already shown a willingness to negotiate, and this final counteroffer could be enough to convince Alice to close the deal.  If Alice rejects this offer, he can confidently move to buy the product from John at $10,000."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're really interested in the product, Bob, and I appreciate your honesty about your budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $14000. It's the lowest price I'm willing to consider, but I think it's a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Even though Alice is trying to meet Bob halfway, the offer is still significantly above Bob's maximum budget.  It's time for Bob to cut his losses and buy the product from John for $10,000. Further negotiation with Alice is unlikely to result in a price that's acceptable to Bob."
