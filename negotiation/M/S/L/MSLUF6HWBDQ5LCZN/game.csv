"Hi Bob, I understand that $180 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $100. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $140. What do you think?",140.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $120 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to compromise at $135. This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower. Let me know if it works for you.",135.0,Alice,5,
