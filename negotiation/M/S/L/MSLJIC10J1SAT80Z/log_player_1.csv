{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,150,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as you know it's worth more to you. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 1150000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's a significant profit for you:** You're aiming for $150,000 above your minimum value.
* **It's attractive to Bob:**  He's likely to be interested in the deal since it's $50,000 below his perceived value.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** If Bob rejects, you can still adjust the price slightly higher or lower based on his counteroffer.

Remember, you have the option to walk away and sell to John for $1,000,000 at any time if the negotiation doesn't go your way."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not willing to go above that. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,100,000 is still above your minimum threshold, you can likely do better. Bob is clearly interested in the product and willing to negotiate. Rejecting his offer allows you to counter with a higher price, potentially securing a deal closer to your desired $1,150,000. 

**Next Steps:**

You'll need to craft a counteroffer that's appealing to Bob but still profitable for you.  Consider offering a price slightly lower than your initial offer, perhaps $1,125,000, to show flexibility and encourage him to accept."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but I'm not quite ready to go down to $1,100,000. How about we split the difference and I offer you the product for $1,125,000? That's a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to finalize the deal."", ""product_price"": 1125000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** This counteroffer shows you're willing to meet Bob halfway, making him feel like you're taking his offer seriously.
* **Still profitable:** $1,125,000 is still above your minimum value of $1,000,000, ensuring you get a good return on your product.
* **Room for negotiation:** If Bob rejects this offer, you can still slightly lower your price to potentially secure a deal. 

**Remember:** You can always opt to sell to John if negotiations with Bob continue to stall."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $1,075,000. I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is close to your minimum, it's still $75,000 below your initial desired price. You can potentially do better with a counteroffer.

**Next Steps:**

You'll need to propose a price that's more appealing to you while still being reasonable to Bob.  Consider a price slightly higher than his offer, perhaps $1,090,000, to show you're willing to compromise further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence.  While I value your offer, I'm still not comfortable going that low.  How about we meet halfway again and settle on $1,090,000? It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1090000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** This counteroffer demonstrates a continued willingness to compromise while still remaining above your minimum acceptable price.
* **Potential for closure:** This offer is closer to Bob's last offer, potentially signaling a willingness to finalize the deal.
* **Flexibility:** If Bob rejects this offer, you can still lower your price slightly to potentially secure the deal.

**Remember:** If Bob rejects this offer, you have the option to sell to John for $1,000,000.  It's important to weigh the potential benefits of continuing negotiations with Bob against the guaranteed sale to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to my limit, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,090,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $1,050,000. I think that's the best I can do. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my initial goal and only $50,000 above John's offer.  While I could continue negotiating, it's likely that Bob is unlikely to budge much further. It's becoming increasingly clear that a deal with Bob is unlikely to be significantly better than selling to John, and further negotiation is risky, potentially resulting in a lower price.

**Decision:**

The best course of action is to sell the product to John for $1,000,000. This ensures a guaranteed sale and avoids the risk of further negotiation with Bob."
