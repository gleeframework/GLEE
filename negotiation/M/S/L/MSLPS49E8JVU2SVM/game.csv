"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product, I'm looking to pay closer to $700000, which reflects its value to me and allows for a mutually beneficial deal.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $700000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering you a price of $850000. This is the lowest I can go while still ensuring I get a fair deal.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $850000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $750000, which is a fair compromise and would allow us to both walk away satisfied.",750000.0,Bob,4,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $820000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to come up to $795000.
