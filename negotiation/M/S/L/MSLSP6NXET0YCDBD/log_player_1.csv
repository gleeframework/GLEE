Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $14,500. I think it's a fair price considering its value. Let me know what you think."", 
""product_price"": 14500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to $15,000 as possible (the price John will pay).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high but below John's offer allows Bob to counter-offer, potentially reaching a price higher than $15,000.
* **Appear Reasonable:**  While high, the price isn't absurdly above Bob's perceived value, making it more likely he'll consider the offer.

**Important Note:** There's a risk Bob will reject the offer. However, since we have John as a guaranteed buyer at $15,000, we can afford to be slightly bolder with our initial offer to Bob."
