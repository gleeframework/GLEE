"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you. However, $10,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This still gives you a great price, and I believe it's fair for both of us. Let me know if you're interested.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.  How about $10,750?  It's still a good deal for you, and it gets me closer to where I need to be. ",10750.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence.  While $10,750 is getting closer, I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to come down to $10,900. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find the product to be worth it. Let's close the deal.",10900.0,Alice,5,
