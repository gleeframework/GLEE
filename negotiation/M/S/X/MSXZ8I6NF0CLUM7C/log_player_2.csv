"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible.  While $11,500 is a good deal, it's still above Bob's ideal price.  He should try to negotiate further with Alice to see if he can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you're offering, but I'm looking to spend closer to $10,500.  Would you be willing to come down a bit? "", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a counteroffer that's still above Alice's value but significantly lower than her initial offer. This shows he's willing to negotiate but also sets a firm lower bound. This strategy aims to start a more serious negotiation without immediately rejecting the deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you. However, $10,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This still gives you a great price, and I believe it's fair for both of us. Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible. While $11,000 is a good deal, he can likely still negotiate further.  He should try to get closer to his target price of $10,500."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.  How about $10,750?  It's still a good deal for you, and it gets me closer to where I need to be. "", ""product_price"": 10750}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is continuing to push for a lower price, but he's also demonstrating flexibility by moving closer to Alice's latest offer.  $10,750 is a compromise that might appeal to Alice. This strategy keeps the negotiation going while maintaining Bob's goal of saving money."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence.  While $10,750 is getting closer, I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to come down to $10,900. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find the product to be worth it. Let's close the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has been steadily lowering the price, and Alice has met him halfway. At $10,900, the price is just slightly above Bob's target of $10,500.  While further negotiation might be possible, the risk of Alice rejecting the offer and potentially raising the price again is high.  Accepting this offer secures a good deal and avoids the potential for further complications."
