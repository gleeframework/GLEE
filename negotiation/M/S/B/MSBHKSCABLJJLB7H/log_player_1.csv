"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you this incredible product for $900,000.  It's a fantastic deal considering its value to you.  Let's start the conversation!"", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $900,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested, but I'd be willing to pay closer to $700,000.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is significantly lower than my ideal price, I'm not ready to sell to John yet.  I believe there's still room for negotiation with Bob to get closer to my desired price.  Rejecting his offer allows me to counter and potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $700,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to be flexible, though. How about we meet in the middle at $800,000? This is a fair price considering the value to you.  Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 800000}
