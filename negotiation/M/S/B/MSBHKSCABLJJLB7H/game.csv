"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $900,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested, but I'd be willing to pay closer to $700,000.  What do you think?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $700,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to be flexible, though. How about we meet in the middle at $800,000? This is a fair price considering the value to you.  Let's make this happen.",800000.0,Alice,3,
