"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

I'm starting with a price of $100. This is a good starting point because it's higher than my minimum value, but it's not an unreasonable price. I'll see how Bob responds and adjust my strategy based on his counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $80 is my minimum, I want to see if I can get a bit more. I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
```

I'm going to counter with $90. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer.  I'm hoping this will be enough to get the deal done, but I'm still leaving some room to negotiate if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $85 is close to my minimum, and I've already had a few rounds of negotiation.  I'm going to accept his offer and move on. It's better to secure a deal than risk losing him and having to sell to John for a lower price."
