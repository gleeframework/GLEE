"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting to take $9,000, I'm confident I can get a better price with some negotiation.  I'm not yet willing to sell to John for $12,000, so I'll keep negotiating with Bob."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you're trying to find a price that works for you. However, $9,000 is simply too low for me. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to go down to $10,500.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $10,250. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,250

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $10,250 is getting closer to my minimum, I believe I can still squeeze out a bit more. I'm not yet ready to sell to John for $12,000, so I'll continue negotiating with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to be reasonable.  However, $10,250 is still a little low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,400 as a final compromise. This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  If you're serious about buying it, I suggest we close the deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 10400}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,400 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $10,300, but no higher. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,300. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,300

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. I'm feeling the pressure to close the deal, but $10,300 is still below my minimum. I'm not willing to settle for less. I'm not yet ready to sell to John for $12,000, so I'll continue negotiating with Bob."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm feeling we're getting very close here.  To show my willingness to come to an agreement, I'll offer you the product for $10,350. This is a price that's fair to both of us. Let's close this deal now, and we can both move on."", ""product_price"": 10350}

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $10,350. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $10,275. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,275. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,275
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $12,000.  We're down to the last few rounds, and while I'm getting closer to my minimum price with Bob,  I'm not confident he'll budge much further. I've already rejected his last two offers, and it's getting increasingly likely that we won't reach an agreement.  Selling to John guarantees me the best possible outcome at this point."
