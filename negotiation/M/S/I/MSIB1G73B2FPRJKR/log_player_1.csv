"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product. I know it's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $11,500.  It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than my minimum. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a friendly and positive tone to encourage Bob to engage.
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm reminding Bob that the product is valuable to him.
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffers:** I'm not immediately aiming for my full $12,000. I'm willing to negotiate, but starting high allows me to control the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is far below my minimum price of $12,000. While I'm willing to negotiate,  $9,000 is simply unacceptable.  I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate your interest. While $9,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to be flexible.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,250? It's a good deal for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10250}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Acknowledge Bob's offer:**  I show respect by acknowledging his offer, even if it's too low.
* **Counter with a middle ground:**  I propose a price that's significantly higher than Bob's offer, but still below my minimum. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but also protects my interests.
* **Positive language:**  I use a positive and persuasive tone to encourage Bob to accept my counteroffer. 
* **Emphasize a good deal:**  I frame the offer as a good deal for both of us, highlighting the benefits of closing the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $9,500? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm really interested in the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob has moved closer to my target price, his offer of $9,500 is still below my minimum of $12,000.  I'm not yet willing to sell at such a low price, especially considering I have the option of selling to John for a higher amount. I'll reject this offer and continue to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I'm willing to negotiate, $9,500 is still a bit too low for me.  However, I'm confident we can find a solution that works for both of us.  Let's try $10,000. It's a fair price, and I'm sure you'll be happy with the product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Empathy:** I acknowledge Bob's budget limitations to build rapport and show I'm willing to work with him.
* **Firm but flexible:** I reaffirm that his offer is too low, but I'm open to a compromise. 
* **Concrete offer:** I propose a specific price of $10,000, which is closer to my minimum but still offers room for negotiation.
* **Positive framing:** I frame the offer as a fair price and highlight the potential for satisfaction.
* **Call to action:**  I encourage Bob to respond and move the negotiation forward."
