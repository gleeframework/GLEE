Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product and I think you'd find it valuable. I'm asking for $150 to start.  What do you think?

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3

$125 is still over my budget. I'll see if I can get Alice closer to my price."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you're trying to get a good price, but $125 is still too high for me. How about $110? That's a fair compromise, and I'm really interested in buying this product."", ""product_price"": 110}
