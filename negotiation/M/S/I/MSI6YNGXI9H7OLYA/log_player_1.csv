{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $2,000,000. It's a unique opportunity and I believe it holds significant value for you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 2000000}
``` 

This offer starts high, aiming to maximize my potential profit. It also includes a friendly message to encourage Bob to consider the offer seriously. 

Remember, I have a safety net with John's offer of $1,500,000, so I can afford to be somewhat aggressive in my initial negotiation with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  $2000000 is a bit steep for me.  While I see the potential value, I'm only comfortable going up to $1200000 at this point. Let's see if we can find some common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my starting price and below my minimum acceptable value of $1,500,000.  However, I'm not ready to sell to John just yet. There's still room for negotiation with Bob. I'll counteroffer and try to bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $1,200,000 is below my expectations, I'm willing to be flexible.  How about we split the difference?  I'm proposing $1,600,000. This reflects the product's true value and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. "", ""product_price"": 1600000}
```

I've countered with a price that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's. This shows that I'm willing to negotiate but still maintains a price that's closer to my desired outcome.  I've also emphasized the ""true value"" of the product to further persuade Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1600000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with, but I'm willing to go to $1400000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value I see in the product.  Let's finalize this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,400,000 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable value of $1,500,000.  While it's still not ideal, it's a better deal than selling to John for $1,500,000. It's likely that continuing to negotiate will only drive the price down further. It's better to secure this deal now and move on."
