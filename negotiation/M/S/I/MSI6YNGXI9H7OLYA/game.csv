"Alice,  $2000000 is a bit steep for me.  While I see the potential value, I'm only comfortable going up to $1200000 at this point. Let's see if we can find some common ground.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $1200000 is below my expectations, I'm willing to be flexible.  How about we split the difference?  I'm proposing $1600000. This reflects the product's true value and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. ",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1600000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with, but I'm willing to go to $1400000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value I see in the product.  Let's finalize this deal.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
