"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **$12,000 is too high.**  You're willing to pay up to $15,000, but there's room for negotiation.
* **Rejecting gives you leverage.** It shows Alice you're serious about getting a better price. 

**Next Steps:**  You should counteroffer Alice with a price closer to your desired range (around $10,000) to see if she's willing to come down."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Strong:**  A $10,000 counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's $12,000, demonstrating your seriousness about saving money.
* **Within Your Range:**  It's still within your maximum budget of $15,000, giving you room to negotiate further if needed.
* **Testing the Waters:** This counteroffer will gauge Alice's willingness to compromise and see if she's ready to come down closer to your desired price."

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too High:**  While Alice has come down from her initial $12,000 offer, $11,000 is still above what you're comfortable paying. 
* **Negotiation Room:** There's still space to negotiate and try to push for a lower price. 
* **Avoiding a Quick Deal:** Accepting now might seem tempting, but you're better off continuing to negotiate and potentially getting a price even closer to your desired range.

**Next Steps:**  You should counteroffer again, likely with a price between $10,000 and $10,500. This demonstrates continued willingness to bargain while staying within your budget."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** This offer shows you're willing to meet Alice halfway, but still maintain some financial advantage.
* **Testing the Limits:** This counteroffer gauges how close Alice is to accepting a price closer to your initial offer. 
* **Strategic Positioning:** If Alice rejects, you can then counteroffer again with a slightly higher price, potentially securing a deal in the next round."

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Point:** Alice's offer of $10,500 is exactly what you countered with in the previous round. This indicates a willingness to compromise and find a middle ground.
* **Good Deal:** While you might prefer a slightly lower price, this deal is still a significant savings compared to buying from John for $15,000. 
* **Avoiding Further Negotiation:**  Continuing to negotiate might lead to a lower price, but it also risks Alice walking away or you reaching a stalemate. Accepting this offer secures the product and avoids further potential delays."
