"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

Alice's offer is still significantly higher than her product valuation. There's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $14,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $10,000?"",
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's offer, but it's still within a reasonable range considering her product valuation. By starting low, we can gauge how flexible she is willing to be on the price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest. $10,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $12,000? That's still a great deal for you, as it's well below what the product is worth to you.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Alice's offer of $12,000 is better, it still matches her valuation of the product.  There's a chance we can get a slightly better price with another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $12,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something a little more budget-friendly. Would you be willing to do $11,000?"",
""product_price"": 11000
}
``` 

We're splitting the difference again, showing a willingness to compromise while still pushing for a price below Alice's valuation."
