"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1000000} 

I'm starting high, aiming for a significant profit.  I believe this product is valuable, and Bob might be willing to pay a premium. If he rejects, we'll see where his counteroffer lands."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $750,000 is a good sum, I'm still confident I can get closer to my desired price. I'll counter Bob's offer and see if we can bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm moving down slightly from my initial offer, but still aiming for a substantial profit. This counteroffer shows flexibility, while staying above my minimum acceptable price."

Bob's offer is very close to my minimum acceptable price, and I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely.  $850,000 is a good outcome, and I'm happy to accept."
