Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but  $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider a price closer to $600,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $600,000.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for coming closer to my price range.  While $900,000 is still a bit steep, I'd be willing to go up to $700,000. I think that's a fair offer considering the value it holds for me and the fact that we're both compromising. What do you think?
