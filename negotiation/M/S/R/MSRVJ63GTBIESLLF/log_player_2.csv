"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing opportunity to purchase a unique product that I think you'll really appreciate. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you is $15,000, and I'm confident you'll find it a great addition to your collection. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is $3,000 less than your maximum willingness to pay.** This represents a significant saving for you.
* **Buying from John would cost you the full $15,000.**  

While you could potentially try to negotiate further with Alice, accepting her offer is the most logical choice to maximize your savings."
