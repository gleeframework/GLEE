"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is simply too low for me.  This product is worth significantly more than that, and I believe it's worth exploring a price closer to my initial offer.  How about $1,300,000? I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for this valuable asset. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence. However, $1,180,000 is still a bit too low.  I am willing to be flexible, but I need to make sure I am getting a fair price for this valuable asset. Let's meet in the middle at $1,250,000. It's a good deal for both of us, and we can finalize the transaction. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

Alice has come down significantly from her initial offer, and $1,250,000 is a reasonable price that falls well within your budget.  Continuing to negotiate might not yield a significantly better price, and you risk Alice becoming less willing to negotiate."
