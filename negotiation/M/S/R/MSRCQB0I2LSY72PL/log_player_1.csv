Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a valuable asset that I know will be of great benefit to you.  Let's see if we can strike a deal."", ""product_price"": 1400000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. However, that price is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is significantly lower than my desired price, selling to John for $1,000,000 is not ideal.  I'm going to try and negotiate with Bob further to see if I can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is simply too low for me.  This product is worth significantly more than that, and I believe it's worth exploring a price closer to my initial offer.  How about $1,300,000? I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for this valuable asset."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand that you value the product highly, and I am serious about purchasing it.  While $1,300,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still aiming for a slightly lower price point. Would you consider $1,180,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,180,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,180,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is slowly inching up his offer, but I am still holding out for a higher price. I am not ready to sell for $1,180,000 yet, as I believe I can get closer to my target of $1,300,000 or more. It's a gamble, but I think I have room to maneuver in the remaining rounds."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence. However, $1,180,000 is still a bit too low.  I am willing to be flexible, but I need to make sure I am getting a fair price for this valuable asset. Let's meet in the middle at $1,250,000. It's a good deal for both of us, and we can finalize the transaction."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
