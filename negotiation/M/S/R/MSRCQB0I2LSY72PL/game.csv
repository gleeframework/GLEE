"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a valuable asset that I know will be of great benefit to you.  Let's see if we can strike a deal.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. However, that price is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product. What do you think?",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is simply too low for me.  This product is worth significantly more than that, and I believe it's worth exploring a price closer to my initial offer.  How about $1,300,000? I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for this valuable asset.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand that you value the product highly, and I am serious about purchasing it.  While $1,300,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still aiming for a slightly lower price point. Would you consider $1,180,000?",1180000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence. However, $1,180,000 is still a bit too low.  I am willing to be flexible, but I need to make sure I am getting a fair price for this valuable asset. Let's meet in the middle at $1,250,000. It's a good deal for both of us, and we can finalize the transaction.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
