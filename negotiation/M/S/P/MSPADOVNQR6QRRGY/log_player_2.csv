"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $900000. This is a competitive price, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is a good deal, you can still potentially get a better price from Alice.  Rejecting the offer allows you to negotiate further and see if you can reach a price closer to your $800,000 limit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $900,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to offer $850,000 for the product.  This price reflects its value to me and allows for a fair profit margin for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to reduce the price to $875000, which is still a great value for the product. I believe this price reflects a fair compromise and allows us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $875,000 is a good deal, considering your maximum budget is $800,000.  While you could potentially continue negotiating and try to get a lower price, there is a risk that Alice will reject your counteroffer, and you might end up having to buy from John at $800,000.  Accepting Alice's offer gives you a good deal while still staying within your budget."
