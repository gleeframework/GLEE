"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to acquire a valuable product. Given its potential and worth, I'm proposing an initial price of $950,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for a mutually beneficial deal.",950000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $950,000 is a bit too high for me. Given the product's value to you, I'd be willing to pay $850,000.  This is a fair price that allows us both to benefit from the deal. What do you think?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and your understanding of the product's value.  While I aim for a mutually beneficial agreement, $850,000 is a bit lower than I can consider at this time. How about we meet in the middle at $900,000?  This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the product's true worth.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're looking for a fair deal, and I am too.  $900,000 is still too high for me. Let's split the difference and go with $875,000. This is a reasonable compromise that's closer to our target price.  I'm confident we can finalize the agreement and make this a win-win situation for both of us.",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I respect that. I'm eager to reach an agreement that works for both of us.  While your offer is appealing, I'm aiming for a slightly higher figure. Would you consider $890,000? This would allow me to feel good about the deal and ensure you acquire a truly valuable asset.",890000.0,Alice,5,
