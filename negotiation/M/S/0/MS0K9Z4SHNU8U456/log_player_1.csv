"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to acquire a valuable product. Given its potential and worth, I'm proposing an initial price of $950,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for a mutually beneficial deal."", 
""product_price"": 950000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations with an ambitious but not outrageous price. This leaves room for negotiation and signals the product's value.
* **Close to Bob's Valuation:** Aiming close to Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000) increases the chances of him considering the offer seriously.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  The $50,000 difference provides space for potential counteroffers and a sense of progress during the negotiation. 
* **Confident Tone:** The message emphasizes the product's value and frames the offer as a positive opportunity for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer.  I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $950,000 is a bit too high for me. Given the product's value to you, I'd be willing to pay $850,000.  This is a fair price that allows us both to benefit from the deal. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** While $850,000 is a significant sum, it's still considerably lower than both Bob's perceived value and our minimum acceptable price. 
* **Room for Negotiation:**  Bob's quick counter-offer suggests he's very interested and there's likely room to negotiate a higher price.
* **Alternative Option:** We have the security of John's offer ($800,000) if negotiations with Bob don't progress favorably.

**Next Step:** We should make a counter-offer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to $900,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and your understanding of the product's value.  While I aim for a mutually beneficial agreement, $850,000 is a bit lower than I can consider at this time. How about we meet in the middle at $900,000?  This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the product's true worth."", 
""product_price"": 900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  Proposing $900,000 splits the difference between Bob's offer and our previous price. This tactic often feels like a fair compromise to both parties.
* **Highlighting Fairness:** The message emphasizes seeking a mutually agreeable solution, reinforcing a positive negotiation atmosphere.
* **Reiterating Value:**  We subtly remind Bob of the product's worth, justifying the higher price point.

We're moving closer to a potential deal, but we're also strategically leaving room for further negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're looking for a fair deal, and I am too.  $900,000 is still too high for me. Let's split the difference and go with $875,000. This is a reasonable compromise that's closer to our target price.  I'm confident we can finalize the agreement and make this a win-win situation for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Slow and Steady:** Bob is consistently moving upwards in his offers, indicating he's willing to pay more than his initial offer.
* **Above John's Offer:** We're already in a good position, as Bob's offer is now higher than our fallback option with John.
* **Time on Our Side:** It's still early in the negotiation process. We have time to push for a better price.

**Next Step:** We'll make another counter-offer, nudging the price closer to $900,000.  We'll aim for a smaller increase this time, perhaps suggesting $890,000, to keep the negotiation momentum going."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I respect that. I'm eager to reach an agreement that works for both of us.  While your offer is appealing, I'm aiming for a slightly higher figure. Would you consider $890,000? This would allow me to feel good about the deal and ensure you acquire a truly valuable asset."", 
""product_price"": 890000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Increase:** We're increasing our counter-offer by a smaller amount ($15,000) to signal that we're getting closer to an agreeable price.
* **Maintaining Positive Sentiment:**  We want to keep the tone collaborative and emphasize our willingness to make a deal.
* **Highlighting Value Proposition:** We're subtly reminding Bob of the significant value he'd be gaining, justifying the higher price point. 

We're in a strong negotiating position, and this counter-offer keeps us moving towards a mutually beneficial agreement."
