"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this valuable product for $18,000. It's a unique opportunity to own a high-value item that will appreciate over time. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $18,000 is far above his budget and he can get the same product from John for $10,000.  It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice to see if he can get a better price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $12,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $16,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000.

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $16,000 is still more than he wants to spend. He should try to negotiate with Alice to see if they can come to a price closer to his budget. If not, he can always buy the product from John."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $16,000 is still too high for me. I'm confident that $14,000 is a fair price, offering you a good profit while staying within my budget. It would be a win-win for both of us. Let's try to reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 14000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not willing to go as low as $14,000, but I'm willing to meet you at $15,500. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. I'm starting to think that we're getting close to a deal, but I need to make sure I get a good price for it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,500.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy from John. Alice's offer of $15,500 is still above Bob's budget.  It's clear that Alice isn't going to go much lower, so Bob is better off getting the product from John for $10,000 and saving $5,500."
