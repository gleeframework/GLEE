"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product, $18,000 is outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for it.  This price would still leave you a profit and allows me to purchase the product. Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $12,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $16,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $16,000 is still too high for me. I'm confident that $14,000 is a fair price, offering you a good profit while staying within my budget. It would be a win-win for both of us. Let's try to reach an agreement.",14000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm not willing to go as low as $14,000, but I'm willing to meet you at $15,500. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. I'm starting to think that we're getting close to a deal, but I need to make sure I get a good price for it. What do you think?",15500.0,Alice,5,
