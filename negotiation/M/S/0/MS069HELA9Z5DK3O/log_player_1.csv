Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 115}
``` 

This offer starts at a price slightly above your minimum threshold, leaving room for negotiation but also showing that you value the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
 
While $105 is better than selling to John, I still have room to negotiate with Bob and hope to get closer to my initial offer of $115."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm lowering my price slightly to $110, which is still above Bob's offer and closer to my initial price. This shows I'm willing to compromise but also that I still value the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is now at my minimum acceptable price. However, I've reached a point where further negotiation may not be worth the time and effort. John is willing to buy the product for the same price, and selling to him avoids the risk of further negotiation that might lead to a lower price."
