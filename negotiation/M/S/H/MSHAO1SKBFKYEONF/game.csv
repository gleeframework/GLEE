"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate it. However, I am only willing to pay up to $12,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me. Please let me know if you can accommodate this offer.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $13,000? That's still a good deal for you, and I can make it work on my end. Let me know what you think.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Alice. While I understand your position, I am still unable to meet you at $13,000. I would like to stick to my original offer of $12,000. If you're unable to match this, I will consider purchasing the product from another seller.",12000.0,Bob,4,
