Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13500. This still gives you a good price, and it's closer to the value I'm looking for. Let me know if you're interested in this compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $13,500 is within my budget and represents a significant discount from her initial price.  This is a good deal, especially since I can buy the same product from John for $15,000.  Accepting the offer will save me $1,500."
