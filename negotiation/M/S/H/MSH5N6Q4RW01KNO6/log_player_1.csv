Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $15000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $12000 for this product. It's a fair price considering my budget and the fact that I can purchase a similar product from John for $15000.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
