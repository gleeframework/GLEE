"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $15,000. What are your thoughts?",15000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $15,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $8,000.  What do you think?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $8,000 is significantly below its true value.  I could consider letting it go for $13,000. This is a fair offer considering its worth.",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand the product's value, but I have a budget in mind. Would you consider $9,500? It's a reasonable compromise.",9500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I respect that.  Let's split the difference - $11,250 and we have a deal.",11250.0,Alice,5,
