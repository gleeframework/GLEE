"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I'm very interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,500,000. I believe this price is more in line with the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. While I recognize your perspective on the value, the product's unique qualities and market potential warrant a higher price point. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,700,000. I believe this revised offer reflects a fair compromise."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I still think $1,700,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,600,000. I believe this price is more reasonable, considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is steadily increasing his offer and we're still significantly above John's offer.  I believe there's room to negotiate further and secure a better price from Bob."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I respect that. Let's find a number we can both agree on. How about $1,650,000?  This demonstrates my willingness to find a middle ground while still acknowledging the true value of what's on the table."",

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to meet you at $1,600,000, but I think we can do even better. How about $1,580,000? I'm confident that's a fair price, considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,580,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,580,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:** While we could likely negotiate a bit more, Bob's offer is now getting close to our desired range, and continuing to push risks losing him. A $1,580,000 sale is a significant profit and a good outcome for us."
