"I'm very interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,000,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the market value of similar products. Can you consider meeting me in the middle at $1,150,000?",1150000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer. While I understand your perspective on the market value,  $1,150,000 is still significantly below what I need to consider. I'm willing to meet you halfway,  let's try $1,200,000. This price reflects the true value of the product and would be a fair deal for both of us. Let me know your thoughts on this.",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit hesitant to pay $1,200,000. I'm willing to make a compromise, but I think $1,150,000 is a fair price. Can you consider meeting me at $1,175,000?",1175000.0,Bob,4,
