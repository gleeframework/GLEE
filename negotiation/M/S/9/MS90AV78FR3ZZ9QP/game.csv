"I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob. I can do $140, but I have to say, I'm not willing to go much lower than that. It's a great product, and I think it's worth every penny!",140.0,Alice,3,,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $140 is still a bit out of my price range. I'm happy to meet you in the middle at $125. This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'd be happy to finalize the deal.",125.0,Bob,4,,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I can see you're really interested in the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a bit more than that. How about $130?",130.0,Alice,5,,

"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $130 is still a bit high for me.  Let's split the difference and go with $125. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to buy the product right now.",125.0,Bob,6,,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $125. I'm willing to go up a bit more, but I think $135 is a more reasonable price for this great product. What do you think?",135.0,Alice,7,,
