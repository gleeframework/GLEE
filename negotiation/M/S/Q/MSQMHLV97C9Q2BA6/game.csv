"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth more than $100 to me, and I believe it could be valuable to you as well. Let's discuss a fair price. My initial offer is $150.",150.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Can we meet in the middle at $135?",135.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your interest, Bob. I appreciate your feedback. To better accommodate your budget, I am willing to consider $140 for the product. Let me know if this works for you.",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. However, $140 is still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to meet you at $130. Can you consider that?",130.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, Bob. How about we aim for $135? It's a fair compromise considering both our positions. Let me know what you think.",135.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to my limit, but I think I can stretch to $132. Can we meet at that price?",132.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I see your point, Bob. How about we settle at $133? It's a bit above your last offer, but still below my initial asking price. Let's try to find a mutually agreeable solution.",133.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Alice. However, $133 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $130, but that's as low as I can go. Can you consider that?",130.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, Bob. Considering our previous discussions, how about we finalize the deal at $131? This price reflects a reasonable compromise between our initial offers. I hope this works for you.",131.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go any higher, Alice. I'm at my limit of $130. If you can't meet me at that price, I'm afraid I'll have to explore other options.",130.0,Bob,10,
