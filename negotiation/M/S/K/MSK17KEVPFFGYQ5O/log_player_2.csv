Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, that price is a bit high for my budget. I'd be willing to buy it for $800,000."", ""product_price"": 800000}"

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $800,000 is significantly below its true worth. This product offers exceptional value that justifies a higher price. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. I believe this reflects its value while acknowledging your interest. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see you're serious about this product, and I appreciate you working with me on the price. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.  I'm willing to consider a final offer of $1,250,000. This is a significant reduction on my part and reflects my desire to close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is showing a willingness to negotiate, her price reductions are still not bringing the offer close enough to your $1,000,000 limit. She's highly unlikely to go below $1,200,000, especially since she stated this is her ""final offer."" You have a guaranteed option with John at your target price, making it the most logical choice at this point."
