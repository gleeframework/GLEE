"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, that price is a bit high for my budget. I'd be willing to buy it for $800,000.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $800,000 is significantly below its true worth. This product offers exceptional value that justifies a higher price. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. I believe this reflects its value while acknowledging your interest.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. However,  $1,350,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I could potentially meet you at $950,000.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I see you're serious about this product, and I appreciate you working with me on the price. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.  I'm willing to consider a final offer of $1,250,000. This is a significant reduction on my part and reflects my desire to close this deal.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
