"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this exceptional product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm initially proposing a price of $1,500,000. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price significantly higher than both Bob's perceived value and my minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest and flexibility.
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes the product's ""unique value and potential"" to justify the high initial price.
* **Open for Discussion:**  The tone remains amicable and invites Bob's input, setting the stage for a collaborative negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, that price is a bit high for my budget. I'd be willing to buy it for $800,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly below both my minimum price and his own perceived value of the product. Accepting would mean a substantial loss.  It's clear we have a wide gap to bridge, but I'm willing to negotiate further before resorting to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $800,000 is significantly below its true worth. This product offers exceptional value that justifies a higher price. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. I believe this reflects its value while acknowledging your interest."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Reject Low Offer:** Clearly stating that $800,000 is unacceptable shows I'm serious about getting a fair price.
* **Significant but Gradual Concession:**  I'm making a substantial decrease from my initial offer, signaling flexibility, but not dropping too close to my minimum yet. 
* **Reiterating Value:** Reminding Bob of the product's value helps justify the higher price and potentially moves him away from his low initial anchor.
* **Seeking Compromise:** By positioning this as a move towards a ""middle ground,"" I encourage Bob to reciprocate with a more reasonable counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. However,  $1,350,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I could potentially meet you at $950,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer has increased, it's still significantly below my $1,200,000 minimum. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I need to see more substantial movement from his side to continue with him over John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I see you're serious about this product, and I appreciate you working with me on the price. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.  I'm willing to consider a final offer of $1,250,000. This is a significant reduction on my part and reflects my desire to close this deal."",
""product_price"": 1250000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledging Bob's Effort:** Recognizing Bob's attempts to find common ground helps maintain a positive atmosphere.
* **Final Offer:** By framing this as my ""final offer,"" I create a sense of urgency and limit further back-and-forth. 
* **Strategic Price:** $1,250,000 is still above my minimum, leaving room for a small concession if needed, but emphasizes the value I place on the product.
* **Closing Mentality:** I'm expressing my desire to close the deal, signaling to Bob that now is the time for a decision."
