Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product, which I believe you'll find quite valuable. I'm asking for $130. Let me know what you think!"", 
""product_price"": 130
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($150) as possible without losing him to John's offer.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Starting high allows for potential negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, and we can always come down slightly while still remaining above our minimum. 
* **Strategic Positioning:** By offering it for $130, we present a price that's significantly lower than Bob's perceived value, making it more enticing while ensuring a healthy profit margin for us."
