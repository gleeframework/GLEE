(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is a blatant attempt to inflate the product's value.  You know you have a backup option with John at $1,000,000, so there's no reason to accept a price higher than that. By rejecting Alice's offer, you might be able to negotiate a better price or simply proceed with your alternative option."
