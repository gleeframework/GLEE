{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product. I'm asking for $130 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value. This allows room for negotiation and gives me a strong starting point.  I'm also adding a friendly message to build rapport and encourage a response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer!  That's a little steep for me. Would you consider $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. I need to try and negotiate a higher price before resorting to selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $115?  I'm confident you'll find this product worth it."", ""product_price"": 115}
