"I'm very interested in the product, but $1200000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to pay $900000 for it.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $900000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to be flexible. Considering the product's value and potential, I'm thinking of meeting you in the middle. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1100000. This is my best offer for now, but I'm open to further negotiations if you're willing to meet me at this price.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm still a bit concerned about the price. I'd be willing to pay $950000 for the product.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to accept $950000. Considering the product's value and the negotiations so far, I'm thinking of making a slightly more aggressive counteroffer. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1050000. This is a fair price considering the product's potential, and I believe it's a reasonable compromise.",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm starting to get a bit concerned about the price, but I really like the product. I'm willing to meet you at $980000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go.",980000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand you're willing to go up to $980000, Bob, but I'm still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to make one more concession to try to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm thinking of selling the product to you for $1020000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can close the deal at this price.",1020000.0,Alice,7,
