"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. This is a great price, considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for several reasons:

* **It's above your minimum:** $950,000 is comfortably above your minimum of $800,000.
* **It's below Bob's perceived value:** This leaves room for negotiation and potential compromise.
* **It's a strong opening:**  A confident and fair opening offer shows you are serious about negotiating and sets a clear expectation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $800,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $800,000 is your minimum, there's still room for negotiation. Accepting Bob's offer now would mean missing out on the potential to earn more.  By rejecting, you keep the negotiation open and can potentially increase the price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal. While $800,000 is my minimum, I believe this product is worth more. I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This reflects its value and allows for a fair deal for both of us. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  This counteroffer demonstrates a willingness to compromise while still securing a price closer to your desired range. 
* **Focus on value:** The message emphasizes the product's worth, subtly reminding Bob of the potential benefits. 
* **Openness:** The message ends with a question, encouraging Bob to respond and continue the dialogue."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. Considering the value of the product to me, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $820,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $820,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $820,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has moved closer to your desired price, and there's a good chance he won't budge much further.  While you could continue to negotiate, there's a risk of losing the deal altogether.  Accepting his offer secures a sale at a price that's only slightly below your initial goal and significantly better than selling to John."
