"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $13,000.  This is a reasonable starting point, given that the product is worth $12,000 to both of us.  I'm hoping that Bob will be willing to pay a little extra for the product, as it's likely he values it more than just the minimum. I'm also keeping in mind that John is willing to pay $12,000, which is a safety net if Bob doesn't accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is lower than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. I will reject his offer and counteroffer in the next round. I want to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price within our 10 rounds.  However, selling to John is always an option if negotiations fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500}
```

I'm counteroffering with $12,500. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer.  I'm still above my minimum acceptable price of $12,000, but I'm showing flexibility. Hopefully, this will be enough to encourage Bob to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $12,000 is my minimum acceptable price. It's a fair deal for both of us, and I'm happy to accept it.  I've secured the value of the product while avoiding any further negotiation."
