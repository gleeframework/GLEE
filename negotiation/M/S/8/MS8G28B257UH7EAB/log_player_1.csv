Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value of this product, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","Since Bob's offer is lower than the minimum price I'm willing to accept ($1,200,000), I will reject his offer and proceed to the next round.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,200,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  However, $1,050,000 is still a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to go up to $950,000, but that's my final offer.  Let me know if you're willing to accept. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","Since Bob's offer is still lower than my minimum price of $1,200,000, I will reject his offer and proceed to the next round.

However, I should also consider that selling the product to John for $1,500,000 is a more lucrative option, so I'll choose to sell the product to John instead of making another counteroffer to Bob.
