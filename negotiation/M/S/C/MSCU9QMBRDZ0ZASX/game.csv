"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $12,000 is a little steep for me.  Would you consider $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  I understand it's a bit high for you, but $9,000 is below what I'm looking for.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows for a good deal for both of us. What do you say?",11000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you coming down, Alice.  I'm getting closer, but $11,000 is still a bit more than I was hoping to spend. How about we meet in the middle at $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,4,
