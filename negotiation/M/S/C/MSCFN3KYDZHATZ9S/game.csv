"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. However, $20,000 is a bit steep for my budget. Would you consider $10,000 for this product?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $20,000 might be a bit out of your budget, but $10,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $16,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair price for this amazing product.",16000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me closer to my budget. How about we settle at $13,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",13000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, but $13,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I'll meet you at $14,500. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's a fair price for the product's value.",14500.0,Alice,5,
