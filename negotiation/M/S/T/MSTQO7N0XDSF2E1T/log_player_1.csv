Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product I think you'd be interested in! I'm offering it to you for $100.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price of $100, which is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable value of $80. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Positive and engaging message:** I'm using a friendly and inviting tone to encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation.

**Next Steps:**

I'll wait for Bob's response. If he accepts, great! If he rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and decide whether to accept, reject, or make a new counteroffer. I'll also keep John's offer of $80 in mind as a safety net if the negotiation with Bob doesn't lead to a satisfactory price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is close but not ideal:** While Bob's offer of $90 is closer to my minimum acceptable value of $80, it's still below what I'd like to get. I believe there's still room for negotiation.
* **Negotiating for a better price:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I can make a counteroffer and try to secure a price closer to my initial asking price. This shows Bob that I'm serious about getting a fair value for my product.
* **Maintaining leverage:** Selling to John for $80 is a safe option, but I don't want to settle for the minimum just yet.  I'll see if I can get a better price from Bob through further negotiation. 

**Next Steps:**

I'll make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price somewhere between $90 and my initial asking price of $100. I'll carefully consider Bob's likely response and the potential outcome of further negotiations. I'll also keep John's offer in mind as a backup if things don't work out with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product! $90 is definitely closer to what I'm hoping for.  How about we split the difference and meet at $95?  It's a great deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer strategy:** I'm splitting the difference between my initial asking price of $100 and Bob's offer of $90. This shows flexibility and willingness to compromise. 
* **Positive framing:** I'm using a positive tone and emphasizing the ""great deal"" for both of us to encourage Bob to accept. 
* **Moving closer to my goal:** While I'm willing to compromise, I'm still pushing for a price that's closer to my desired value.  

**Next Steps:**

I'll carefully consider Bob's response.  If he accepts, great! If he rejects, I'll need to weigh my options.  I'll analyze his potential counteroffer, keeping John's offer of $80 as a safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $95. How about we try to get even closer to my original target of $90? Could you do $92? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my goal:** Bob's offer of $92 is just $2 away from my initial asking price of $100 and significantly higher than my minimum acceptable value of $80. 
* **Risk of further negotiation:** Continuing to negotiate might result in a lower price, and I don't want to risk getting stuck with a lower offer. 
* **Time is money:**  The longer I spend negotiating with Bob, the more I'm losing out on potential sales to other buyers. 

**Next Steps:**

I'll accept Bob's offer and finalize the sale.  This will allow me to move on to other opportunities."
