Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$10,000** is a reasonable starting point. It's above Bob's perceived value but below my minimum acceptable price.
* **The message** is friendly and encouraging.  I'm highlighting the value of the product while leaving room for negotiation.

This strategy aims to:

* **Start strong:**  I'm not giving away the product cheaply.
* **Leave room for negotiation:** There's space for Bob to counteroffer, potentially leading to a mutually beneficial agreement.
* **Set a clear baseline:** This helps avoid drawn-out negotiations.

I'm also prepared to walk away if the negotiation doesn't lead to a satisfactory price. I have a guaranteed alternative with John, which gives me leverage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. Would you be willing to meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. While it's tempting to meet him halfway, accepting his offer would result in a substantial loss for me. 

By rejecting his offer, I can:

* **Maintain my bargaining position:** It demonstrates that I'm not desperate for a sale and am willing to walk away if needed.
* **Explore a counteroffer:** I can try to bridge the gap and find a price that works for both of us. 
* **Preserve the option to sell to John:**  I still have a guaranteed sale at a much higher price, which gives me the leverage to potentially negotiate a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, and I'm willing to negotiate further. However, $8,500 is simply too low for me.  Let's try $9,500. This would be a great deal for you, and it's closer to my bottom line. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm proposing $9,500, which is halfway between my previous offer of $10,000 and Bob's offer of $8,500.
* **Reasoning:** I'm emphasizing the value of the product and framing the offer as a great deal for Bob.
* **Maintain leverage:** I'm still holding firm on my minimum price, but showing a willingness to compromise.

This counteroffer aims to:

* **Signal flexibility:**  I'm demonstrating that I'm open to negotiation.
* **Maintain a profitable price:** $9,500 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.
* **Encourage further negotiations:** It leaves room for Bob to counteroffer again, potentially leading to a mutually agreeable price.

I'm still prepared to walk away if Bob isn't willing to meet me halfway. My alternative sale to John ensures that I won't settle for a price that's significantly below the product's worth to me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that $9,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again. How about we try $9,000? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $9,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price of $12,000 than my previous counteroffer of $9,500. While I'd still prefer to get closer to $12,000, accepting his offer is a better option than continuing to negotiate or selling to John. 

Here's why:

* **Potential for further negotiation:** Even though I'm accepting his offer, I can still try to negotiate a higher price for future transactions if we continue working together.
* **Time and effort:**  Continuing to negotiate could be time-consuming and potentially lead to a stalemate. 
* **Maintaining a good relationship:** Accepting Bob's offer demonstrates flexibility and shows him that I'm willing to work with him. This can be beneficial for future business opportunities.
* **Profitable outcome:**  While $9,000 is not ideal, it's still a profitable sale and better than selling to John at $12,000.

By accepting Bob's offer, I'm securing a sale while minimizing potential risks and keeping the door open for future collaboration."
