"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000.  I believe this reflects its true worth, but I'm open to hearing your thoughts.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,100,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me and allows for some room for negotiation.  What do you think?",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate you coming back with an offer. While I understand your perspective, $850,000 is significantly below its true value and potential. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,000,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm firm on $900,000. This price is a fair compromise, considering the value of the product to both of us.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm sensing we're getting closer. To demonstrate my commitment to making this work, I'm willing to come down to $975,000. This is a significant concession on my end, and I believe it represents a fair deal for both of us.",975000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $975,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm offering $925,000. This price is a fair middle ground, and I believe it reflects the value of the product to both of us.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",925000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, we're getting down to the wire here. I'm prepared to make one final offer: $950,000. This is the absolute lowest I can go, and I believe it's a very fair price considering the value this product offers.  What do you say?",950000.0,Alice,7,
