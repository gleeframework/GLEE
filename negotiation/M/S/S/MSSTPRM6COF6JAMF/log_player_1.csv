"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice! It's a great product, but $200 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. Would you be willing to do $150? I'm really interested in buying it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
