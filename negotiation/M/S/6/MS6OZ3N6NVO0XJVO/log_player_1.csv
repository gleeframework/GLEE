Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a steal at $99. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides."", 
""product_price"": 99
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I could sell to John for $100, there's a chance to get a slightly higher price from Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:**  $99 is just above Bob's perceived value ($80) but still attractive enough to potentially entice him. It's unlikely Bob would accept an offer much higher than this.
* **Clear Communication:** The message is straightforward and highlights the ""deal"" aspect to make the offer more appealing."
