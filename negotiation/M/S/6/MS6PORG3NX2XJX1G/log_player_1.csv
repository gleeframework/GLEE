Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This is a strategic starting point. Here's why:

* **It's above your minimum:** $12,000 is higher than your minimum acceptable price of $10,000, leaving room for negotiation.
* **It's not too aggressive:** A price that's too high could scare Bob away. $12,000 leaves some space for Bob to feel he's getting a good deal.

**Next steps:**

* **Observe Bob's reaction.**  If he rejects the offer, you know you'll get $10,000 from John, so you have nothing to lose by trying to negotiate further with Bob.
* **Be prepared to negotiate.**  If Bob wants a lower price, you can adjust your offer based on how valuable you think the product is to him and how likely he is to buy."
