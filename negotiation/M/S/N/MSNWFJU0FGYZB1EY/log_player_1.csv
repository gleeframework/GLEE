Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

This is a starting point, and I'm aiming for a good profit while still leaving room for negotiation.  I'm setting the price high, but not so high that it immediately turns Bob off. I'm also keeping in mind that John is a backup buyer at $10,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low.  While I could sell to John for $10,000, I'm going to try to get closer to my desired price by counteroffering Bob.  I'm not willing to accept $10,000 just yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm going to lower my price a bit to show I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm still aiming for a price significantly higher than Bob's initial offer.  $12,000 is a good compromise point and hopefully will encourage Bob to continue the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is close to my minimum price, and I'm starting to feel like I've pushed the negotiation as far as I can.  At this point, it's better to secure a sale than to risk losing Bob and having to sell to John for $10,000."
