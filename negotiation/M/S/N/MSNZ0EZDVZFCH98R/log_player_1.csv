Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to buy this product for $140.  I know it's valuable to you and this is a fair price."",
""product_price"": 140
}
``` 
 
**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $150, meaning he'd be willing to pay up to that amount.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $120 (your fallback offer from John).
* **Maximizing Profit:** Offering the product at $140 leaves room for negotiation while ensuring you get a significant portion of the potential profit. This price also gives Bob a good deal, increasing the likelihood of him accepting. 

**Why not ask for more?** 

While you could try for a higher price, it risks Bob rejecting the offer. If Bob rejects, you're left with the $120 from John, which is less profitable."
