Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $900,000 is your maximum budget, but I'm not willing to sell the product for that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,050,000. This is a reasonable compromise considering the product's value to you and my initial offer. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.

You should reject Alice's offer.  While it's lower than her initial offer, it's still above your budget. Continue negotiating with Alice to try and get a lower price. There's a chance you might be able to get it closer to your budget."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $950,000 is still a bit above your budget, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $1,025,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to you and my initial offer. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to make a profit.

You should choose to buy the product from John. Alice's offer is still above your budget, and you're unlikely to get her down to your ideal price. John is offering you a guaranteed price within your budget, so it's the most financially sound decision."
