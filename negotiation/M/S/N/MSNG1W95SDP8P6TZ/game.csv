"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's worth to you is $800,000. Let me know if you're interested and we can discuss further.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is still above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering the value to me, and I believe it's a good starting point for negotiation.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $900,000 is your maximum budget, but I'm not willing to sell the product for that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,050,000. This is a reasonable compromise considering the product's value to you and my initial offer. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,050,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to offer $950,000 for the product.  This is a fair compromise, considering our previous offers and the value of the product to me.  I'm hoping we can reach an agreement at this price.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $950,000 is still a bit above your budget, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $1,025,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to you and my initial offer. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to make a profit. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
