Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic product that I believe would be incredibly valuable to you. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,150,000.  I'm open to discussing this further, of course, so let me know your thoughts."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you see in the product. I would like to propose a price of $1,000,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

Bob's offer is too low. We're still early in the negotiation, and we know the product is worth significantly more to him. We can afford to counter in hopes of reaching a better agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counter-offer, but I believe $1,000,000 undervalues the product significantly. Let's find a middle ground â€“ how about $1,125,000?"",
""product_price"": 1125000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise, but hold firm:** We're coming down slightly from our previous offer to show willingness to negotiate, but we're still aiming high as we know the product's worth to Bob.
* **Time consideration:** While we have rounds to spare, we don't want to drag the negotiation unnecessarily. A strong counter-offer keeps the momentum going towards a potentially favorable deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand Alice, but I still believe the product is worth less than $1,125,000. I would like to counter with an offer of $1,075,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Upward Trend:** Bob is incrementally increasing his offers, indicating he's motivated and we're in the right ballpark. 
* **Potential for More:**  We're aiming to capture as much of the $200,000 difference in perceived value as possible. Accepting now might leave money on the table. 
* **Calculated Risk:** We're still above our safety net of John's offer, giving us room to negotiate further."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  How about we settle this right now? I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000, which I feel is more than fair. It's a win-win for both of us."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** We're making a significant jump down to $1,100,000, signaling a strong desire to close the deal now. 
* **Splitting the Difference:** This offer represents a near-perfect split of the difference between Bob's last offer and our previous one, making it a psychologically appealing compromise. 
* **Time Pressure:** By presenting this as our final offer, we create a sense of urgency for Bob to accept before we reconsider our other options."
