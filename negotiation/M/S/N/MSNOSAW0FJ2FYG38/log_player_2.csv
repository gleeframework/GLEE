"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth $150 to you, and we're confident it will meet your needs perfectly. We're currently offering it for $120. Let us know if this works for you! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $120 is a good price, you can likely get it for even less. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you reaching out.  While I value your product, $120 is a bit higher than I'd like to spend right now. I'm willing to pay $100 for it.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. We understand your budget constraints and are willing to adjust our offer. For the next round, we're proposing to sell the product for $110. Please let us know if this is within your consideration. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price to $110, which is within my budget and a good deal considering I was initially hoping to pay $100.  It's likely that further negotiation would result in only a small price decrease, so accepting this offer is the most reasonable choice."
