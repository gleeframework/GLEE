,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $12,000.  Would that work for you?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $12,000 is too low for me to consider, I'm willing to negotiate. How about we meet in the middle at $17,000?",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for countering.  $17,000 is still a little steep for me. Could you do $14,000?  I think that's a fair price.",14000.0,Bob,4,
