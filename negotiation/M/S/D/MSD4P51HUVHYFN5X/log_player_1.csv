""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it would be highly beneficial for you. I'm asking for $11,500. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 11500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to Bob's $12,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $11,500 leaves some wiggle room if Bob tries to negotiate down.
* **Above Minimum:** The price is still comfortably above Alice's minimum acceptable price of $10,000.
* **Alternative Buyer:**  Knowing John provides a safety net, allowing Alice to aim higher with Bob. 

This offer balances ambition with a reasonable chance of success."
