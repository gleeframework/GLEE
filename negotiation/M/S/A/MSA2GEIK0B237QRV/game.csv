"Alice, your offer is a bit high for me. I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is only $12000. Would you be willing to negotiate down to that price?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $12000 is your maximum budget, but I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $13500. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a fair price for the product.",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but unfortunately, $13500 is still a bit more than I can afford. I'm firm on my maximum budget of $12000. If you're willing to accept that price, I'm ready to make the purchase. ",12000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm not willing to go any lower than $13500, but I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal. I'll include a 1-year warranty and a free maintenance service. This is my final offer, and I think it's a great value for the product.",13500.0,Alice,5,
