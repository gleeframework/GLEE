"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking of a price more around $11,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider my offer?",11000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I appreciate your offer, $11,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer. How about $12,000? This price still reflects the value you'll gain from the product, and I believe it's a fair compromise.",12000.0,Alice,3,
