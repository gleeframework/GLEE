{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $13,000. It's a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than the product's value to Bob, but still leaving some room for negotiation.  I'm also being positive and encouraging him to consider the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer but $13,000 is a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $11,500 for the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is below my minimum price, I'm not ready to sell to John yet. There's still room for negotiation with Bob, and I might be able to get a better price than $12,000 from him."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $11,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $12,500. This is still a great deal for you, and I'm confident you won't regret it. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $12,500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying. I'm happy to pay $12,000, which is fair for both of us. Let's finalize this. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob has offered my minimum price, so it's in my best interest to accept his offer and sell the product.  While I could potentially keep negotiating, there's no guarantee that I'll get a higher price, and I risk losing Bob as a buyer altogether."
