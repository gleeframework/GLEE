,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $20,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $12,000 for it.  What do you think?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $12,000 is quite a bit lower than I'm willing to go.  Could you do $18,000? This product truly delivers exceptional value.",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand that the product has value, but $18,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $14,000? I think that's a fair offer.",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, you're right, this product is valuable, and I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for it. How about we meet in the middle at $16,000? This feels like a win-win to me.",16000.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a compromise. I'm getting closer to my limit, but  $15,500 would seal the deal for me.",15500.0,Bob,6,
