"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that's worth a lot to you. I'm offering it to you for $11,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $11,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $7,000.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. While I want to close the deal, accepting his offer would be a substantial loss. I'll counteroffer to try and find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $7,000 is lower than I'd hoped, I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet in the middle at $9,000? This still gives you a good deal, and it's closer to the value I'm looking for."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway there.  $9,000 is closer, but still a little high for my budget. Would you consider $8,000?  That would be a good deal for both of us, I think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired price point. I'm willing to continue negotiating to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable number.  I want to maximize my profit and avoid selling to John for $10,000 if possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While $8,000 is still a bit below what I'm hoping for, I'm open to one final compromise. Let's try $8,500. This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to get closer to my desired value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8500}
