"I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,100,000.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $1,100,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, given its value to me. This represents a significant investment for me, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $850,000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I appreciate your willingness to invest in this product. However, I need to make a profit, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell it to you for $950,000, which is a $150,000 discount from my initial offer. I think this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product to you, while also allowing me to recoup my investment.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $950,000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm willing to go up to $900,000, which is a good price for me and allows you to recoup a significant portion of your investment. Let's try to find a mutually agreeable solution.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Bob, and I'm glad we're able to continue negotiating. However, $900,000 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm willing to sell it to you for $980,000. This is a compromise that I think is fair, considering the value of the product to you and my own investment.",980000.0,Alice,5,
