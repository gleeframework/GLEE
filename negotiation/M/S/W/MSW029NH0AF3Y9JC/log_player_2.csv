Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $850,000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I appreciate your willingness to invest in this product. However, I need to make a profit, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell it to you for $950,000, which is a $150,000 discount from my initial offer. I think this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product to you, while also allowing me to recoup my investment.

Alice's offer is still too high.  You should reject it and try to get closer to your budget."

Let's try to find a mutually agreeable solution."", ""product_price"": 900000}

# Alice's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Bob, and I'm glad we're able to continue negotiating. However, $900,000 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm willing to sell it to you for $980,000. This is a compromise that I think is fair, considering the value of the product to you and my own investment.

While Alice's offer is closer, it's still over your budget.  You can get the product from John for a better price, so you should buy it from him."
