"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Value:** $120
* **Alice's Value:** $80
* **Alice's Offer:** $100

Bob can get a better deal. There's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially save more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Value:** $120
* **Alice's Value:** $80
* **Alice's Offer:** $100

This counteroffer is a reasonable starting point.  It's lower than Alice's offer but still above her value, leaving room for potential compromise. This gives Alice a chance to accept and Bob a chance to save money."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Value:** $120
* **Alice's Value:** $80
* **Alice's Offer:** $110

While Bob could potentially negotiate further, Alice's offer is getting closer to his value. It's risky to keep negotiating because:

* **Time:** Each round is valuable.  
* **John's Price:**  If negotiations fail, John's offer is only $10 more than Alice's offer. 

Accepting Alice's offer saves Bob money and avoids the risk of ending up paying John more."
