"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $15,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'm on a tighter budget.  Would you consider $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $6,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of a price that's closer to what I'd like to get, but still reasonable for you. How about $10,000?",10000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down a bit, Alice. While $10,000 is closer, it's still a touch outside my budget. Could we meet in the middle somewhere around $7,500?",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm still a bit hesitant to meet you exactly in the middle, but I'm willing to come down a bit further. How about $9,000?",9000.0,Alice,5,
