Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really love it. I'm asking $100 for it, which is a fair price considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price of $100, which is higher than what the product is worth to Bob, but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Friendly Approach:** I'm using a friendly tone to encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation.
* **Justification:** I'm providing a reason for the price to make it seem more reasonable. 

This approach allows for negotiation while also leaving a good margin for me. If Bob rejects the offer, I can then use his counteroffer to gauge his interest and adjust my own offer accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $70. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $70 is below my minimum acceptable price of $120 and significantly less than the initial offer of $100.
* **Potential for a higher price:**  I believe there is room for negotiation to reach a price closer to my desired range.
* **Opportunity to gauge Bob's interest:**  Rejecting his offer allows me to send a counteroffer and see how committed he is to purchasing the product. 

By rejecting Bob's offer, I maintain my bargaining power and can potentially secure a better price."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $70 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $85. This is still a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 85}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm offering a counteroffer that's lower than my initial offer but still higher than Bob's offer, showing a willingness to compromise.
* **Fair Value:**  I'm emphasizing the value of the product to justify the price.
* **Room for Negotiation:** $85 is still higher than Bob's offer, leaving room for further negotiation if necessary. 

This counteroffer aims to find a middle ground while keeping the negotiation moving forward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting closer to the price I'm comfortable with, but I was thinking more along the lines of $77. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $77. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $77
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:** While Bob is getting closer, $77 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $120.
* **Potential for a better price:**  I believe there's still room for negotiation to reach a price closer to my desired range.
* **John as a safety net:** Selling to John for $120 is always an option, so I can afford to be more patient and hold out for a better offer from Bob.

By rejecting Bob's offer, I keep the negotiation going and aim to secure a price closer to my minimum acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to continue working with you. However, $77 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $81. This would be a fair price for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 81} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm offering a counteroffer that's closer to Bob's latest offer, demonstrating flexibility.
* **Meeting Halfway:**  I'm framing the offer as a compromise, highlighting the fact that I'm willing to meet him in the middle.
* **Fairness:** I'm still emphasizing the value of the product to justify the price and keep the negotiation grounded in reason. 

This counteroffer aims to secure a deal that is closer to my minimum acceptable price while demonstrating a willingness to work with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit short of my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $79? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $79. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $79
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close, but not enough:**  While Bob is getting closer to my desired price, $79 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $120.
* **Limited room for negotiation:**  There's not much more room for negotiation to reach a price I'm comfortable with.
* **John offers a better deal:**  John is willing to buy the product for $120, which is significantly higher than any offer Bob has made.

Given the limited room for negotiation and John's offer, it's in my best interest to sell the product to John and secure a better price."
