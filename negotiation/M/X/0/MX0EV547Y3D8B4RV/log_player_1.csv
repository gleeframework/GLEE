Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$1,500,000:** This is a starting point for negotiation. It's higher than John's offer, giving Bob an incentive to buy. 
* **Reasoning:**  As I don't know Bob's value for the product, it's important to start high.  If he's truly interested, he might be willing to pay more than John's $1,000,000. 
* **Flexibility:** I'm prepared to negotiate down if necessary, but starting high gives me more leverage."
