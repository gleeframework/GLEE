"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $88

Alice has come down to $88, which is within your budget and a good deal considering her asking price. It's worth accepting to avoid further negotiation and potential for a worse outcome."
