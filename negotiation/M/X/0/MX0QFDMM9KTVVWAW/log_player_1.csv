**Reasoning:** 

Bob seems firmly rooted at $1,200,000. While he's showing interest in the add-on, it's unlikely he'll go higher on the price.  At this point, the risk of continuing the negotiation and potentially getting a lower offer from Bob is outweighing the potential gain. Accepting John's offer guarantees the $1,000,000 baseline."
