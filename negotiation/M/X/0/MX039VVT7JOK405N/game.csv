"Hello Alice, thanks for presenting your offer. While I acknowledge the product's potential value, the price point you've proposed is significantly higher than I'm willing to consider. I'd be interested in exploring a deal closer to $1,000,000. I believe this would be a fair offer reflecting a mutually beneficial agreement.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counter-offer. I understand your perspective, but the value of this product is truly significant, and I can't let it go for that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $1,400,000?",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but the gap is still quite wide.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,100,000. I'm confident this price reflects the value of the product while allowing both of us to walk away satisfied.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I've tried to be flexible, but I need to be realistic about the value of this product.  Let's make this our final exchange - $1,300,000, and we have a deal.",1300000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand this is your final offer, and I respect that. However, I can't justify going higher than $1,150,000.  This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise. If it doesn't work for you, I'll need to explore other options.",1150000.0,Bob,6,
