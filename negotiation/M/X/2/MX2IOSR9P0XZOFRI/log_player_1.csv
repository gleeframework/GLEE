Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $14,000. I know it's valuable to you, and I think this is a fair price that reflects its worth."",
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $15,000.
* **Your Minimum:** You're willing to sell for at least $12,000.
* **Maximizing Profit:** Offering the product at $14,000 gives Bob a good deal (saving him $1,000) while also securing a significant profit for you ($2,000 above your minimum). 

This strategy aims to strike a balance between getting the best possible price from Bob and the risk of him rejecting the offer."
