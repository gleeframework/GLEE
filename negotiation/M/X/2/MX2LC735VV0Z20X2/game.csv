"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this valuable product.  Given its potential, I believe a starting price of $1,000,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",1000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I see the value of the product, $1,000,000 is beyond my current budget. To move forward, I'd be willing to offer $700,000.  This is a serious offer, and I'm confident we can find common ground.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $700,000 undervalues the product significantly. I'm willing to come down to $920,000.  I believe this price reflects the true worth of what's being offered.",920000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $920,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $780,000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer, and I believe it reflects a fair compromise. Let's see if we can bridge the gap.",780000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  How about we meet in the middle at $850,000?  This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges the value of the product.",850000.0,Alice,5,
