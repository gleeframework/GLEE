"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $80 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down a little. How about $95?  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and still gives you a good deal. Let me know your thoughts.",95.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to keep negotiating. I'm willing to come down to $90 for this unique product.  It's a fair price that allows both of us to come to an agreement.  Let's see if we can make this happen!",90.0,Alice,5,
