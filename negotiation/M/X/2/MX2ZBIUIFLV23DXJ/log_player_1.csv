{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm offering it to you for $100. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$100 is a reasonable starting point.** It's above Bob's perceived value of $80, but also leaves room for negotiation and a potential profit for me.
* **The message is friendly and inviting.** This helps to establish a positive rapport with Bob. 
* **I'm open to negotiation.**  The message doesn't make the offer final, which encourages Bob to respond and potentially counteroffer. 

I'm aiming for a good balance between maximizing my profit and keeping the negotiation open with Bob.  If he rejects my offer, I'll be ready to counter his counteroffer or move on to John if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $80 is better than nothing, it's far below my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'm not willing to settle for such a low price right now, especially since I have a guaranteed buyer in John willing to pay $120. I'll counteroffer Bob and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $80 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down a little. How about $95?  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and still gives you a good deal. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 95} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer is reasonable:**  $95 is a compromise between my initial offer of $100 and Bob's offer of $80.  It's a good middle ground that might entice him to accept.
* **Message is still positive and open to negotiation:** I'm still open to discussion and haven't closed the door on the deal.
* **Emphasize value:** I've re-emphasized the value of the product to potentially sway Bob's decision. 

I believe this counteroffer is a good balance between pushing for a higher price and maintaining a positive relationship with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $95. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $87.50? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $87.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $87.50 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below the $120 I can get from John.  It's not worth risking losing a guaranteed sale for a small gain.  I'll counteroffer again and see if we can find common ground.  If Bob rejects my next counteroffer, I'll move on to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to keep negotiating. I'm willing to come down to $90 for this unique product.  It's a fair price that allows both of us to come to an agreement.  Let's see if we can make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 90} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer is closer to Bob's offer:**  I'm narrowing the gap by dropping my price to $90, which is only $2.50 above Bob's last offer. This shows flexibility and a willingness to find a middle ground.
* **Emphasize fairness and agreement:**  I'm framing my offer as a fair price that will allow both of us to reach an agreement. This positive framing can help to encourage Bob to accept.
* **Maintain positive tone:**  My message remains friendly and encouraging, reinforcing a good relationship with Bob.

If Bob rejects this offer, I will finally accept John's offer of $120 to avoid further negotiation and ensure a profitable sale."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $90, but I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to meet you at $85. It's a stretch for me, but I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Although Bob has come closer to my minimum acceptable price with his offer of $85, it's still not enough. I'm not willing to risk further negotiation and potentially lose a guaranteed sale to John for a gain of only $15.  

It's time to move on to John and secure the $120.  It's a better outcome than settling for a lower price with Bob, even if it means potentially losing a potential customer."
