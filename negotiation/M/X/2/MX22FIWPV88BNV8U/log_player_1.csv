"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. I'm really interested in the product, but I have to make sure I'm getting a good deal. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and counteroffer with a price closer to my initial offer.  $8,500 is too low for me, and I think I can get a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $8,500 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more to $9,000. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it's a good value for the product. Let's work together to make this happen."", ""product_price"": 9000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but I'm still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $8,500 and $9,000, so I'll offer $8,750. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While I would prefer a higher price, Bob's offer of $8,750 is close enough to my minimum acceptable price of $8,000. It's better than selling to John for a lower price, and I'd rather close the deal with Bob."
