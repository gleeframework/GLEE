"Bob, I understand your budget concerns, but $100 is just a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little more. How about $120? That's still a good deal for you, and I think it's fair for me.",120.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, and it's getting closer. However, I'm still not quite there.  Could you meet me at $115? This would be a good compromise for both of us, and I think we can finalize this deal.",115.0,Alice,5,
