"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
```

I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than my minimum value. This is to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to negotiate. I'm confident that the product is worth more than $15,000 to me, so I'm not afraid to start high."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum value. I'm going to reject his offer and try to negotiate a better price. I'm still hopeful that I can get a better deal with Bob than selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17500}
```

I'm lowering my price from the initial offer, but still keeping it above my minimum value. I'm trying to find a middle ground with Bob and see if we can reach an agreement. This price is a reasonable compromise that might appeal to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum value, it's still a bit low. I want to see if I can get a bit more. I'm not desperate to sell and want to continue negotiating with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 16000}
```

I'm dropping my price again, but only slightly. I'm still confident in the value of the product and believe Bob will come closer to my price. This is a good compromise and might be enough to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is getting close, but I'm worried we are running out of time. With only 4 rounds left, I'm not sure I can get him to go higher. It's better to be safe and sell to John for the guaranteed $15,000."
