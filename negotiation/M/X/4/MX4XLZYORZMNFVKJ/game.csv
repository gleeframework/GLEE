"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I think it's a game-changer, and I believe you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000. This is a great deal, considering its true value to you is $1,500,000. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but I'm going to need to come in lower than that. I understand the value of this product to me, but I'm only willing to pay $750,000 for it at this point. Let me know if you're willing to negotiate further.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. Considering the product's true value to you is $1,500,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering it to you for $875,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",875000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $875,000 is still a bit too high for me. How about we split the difference and go with $812,500?  It's closer to my ideal price point, and it gives us both a good deal. Let me know what you think.",812500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your desire to find a mutually beneficial price, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm not ready to give up on the potential for a higher profit. I'm willing to meet you at $825,000, which is still a great deal for you, considering the product's true value to you is $1,500,000. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,5,
