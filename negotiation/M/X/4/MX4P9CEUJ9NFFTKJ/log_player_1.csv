``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting at $1,400,000, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but significantly lower than my minimum. This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Message:** I'm framing it as a mutually beneficial opportunity, highlighting the value for Bob while establishing a strong starting point. 
* **Plan:** I'm willing to negotiate, but my fallback option with John gives me leverage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree this product has potential, $1,400,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $1,100,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is higher than his initial perceived value, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob, hoping to reach a price closer to my desired value."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. While $1,100,000 doesn't quite meet my expectations, I'm open to further negotiation. Let's split the difference - I'm willing to offer the product for $1,250,000.  This price acknowledges the product's value and allows for a win-win scenario for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```

* **Plan:** I'm aiming for a quick resolution that still benefits me financially."

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000

```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still not comfortable accepting it. I want to see if I can push for a slightly higher price. I'm not quite ready to sell to John yet, as there's still room for negotiation with Bob."

```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $1,175,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  While I've been willing to negotiate, it's clear that Bob is unwilling to meet my minimum price.  Therefore, it's in my best interest to accept John's offer and sell the product for $1,500,000."
