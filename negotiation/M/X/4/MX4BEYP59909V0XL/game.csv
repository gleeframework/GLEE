"Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $900,000?  This still gives you a great deal and allows me to reach a more reasonable price.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're pushing for a lower price, but $820,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $875,000. This is my final offer before I consider other options.",875000.0,Alice,5,
