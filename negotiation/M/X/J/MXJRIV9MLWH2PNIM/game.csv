,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you offering me this product, but $18000 is quite a bit higher than I'm willing to pay. I'm interested, but I can only go as high as $10000. Let me know if that works for you.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your offer, but $10000 just doesn't cover my costs. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to at least get $14000 for it. Would you be willing to meet me halfway?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate, but $14000 is still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $12000? I'm serious about wanting this product, but I have to stay within my budget.",12000.0,Bob,4,
