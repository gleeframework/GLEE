"Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While $12,000 is lower than I'd hoped for, I'm willing to come down to $15,000. This is still a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $10,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",15000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still a bit above $12,000. I'm willing to go up to $13,500, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me in the middle?",13500.0,Bob,4,
