{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a great deal, and I believe it's worth the price. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. I'm aiming for a price close to my minimum but acknowledging Bob's value for the product. This gives room for negotiation without jeopardizing my minimum value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for it. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. It's not worth selling the product to him for that amount, considering my value for it and the potential of John's offer. I'll counter-offer to push for a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $950,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little, but I need to be closer to $1,050,000 to make this deal work. Let's find a compromise that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,025,000. Can you consider this compromise? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd ideally like to get closer to my minimum price, Bob's offer is getting close enough to make it worthwhile.  There's a chance I could push for a higher price in the next round, but the risk of losing the deal and having to sell to John at a lower price (even though he offers more) is too high. Accepting this offer ensures a sale and minimizes my potential loss."
