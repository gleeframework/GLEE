"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for $18,000. I think it's a great deal considering its value to you is $12,000. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's starting offer is much higher than your maximum price and what you know John will sell the product for.  There's no reason to accept this offer. It's worth entering a counteroffer to see if you can get closer to your desired price range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is way too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $9,000 for the product."",
""product_price"": 9000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** This counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's asking price, but it's a common negotiation tactic to start low and work your way up. 
* **Anchoring:** By throwing out a much lower number, you are trying to ""anchor"" the negotiation closer to your desired range. 
* **Leaving Room to Negotiate:**  This leaves you plenty of room to negotiate upwards towards your $12,000 limit while still potentially getting a better deal. 

It's important to note that this is a bold counteroffer, and Alice may reject it outright. However, it's a calculated risk to see if you can secure a very favorable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're looking to save some money, but $9,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering the product for $14,000. Let me know if that's more to your liking! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has moved closer to your acceptable range, $14,000 is still above your $12,000 limit and what John is offering. There's room for further negotiation. You could try countering with a price closer to your limit to see if Alice is willing to go lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you moving on the price.  To be honest with you, my absolute top budget for this is $11,000. If you can do that, we have a deal."",
""product_price"": 11000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Near Your Limit:** This counteroffer is very close to your absolute maximum price. This sends a signal to Alice that you're serious but still open to a deal.
* **Transparency:** By being transparent about your budget limit (without revealing you have another option), you increase the chance of Alice accepting. She might be willing to take a smaller profit rather than risk losing the sale entirely.
* **Urgency:**  By stating ""If you can do that, we have a deal,"" you add a touch of urgency, potentially motivating Alice to agree."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I can see you're really interested in the product, and I appreciate your honesty about your budget. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm fairly compensated for the product's value. I'm now offering it to you for $13,500. Let me know if that's a price you're comfortable with! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Reached the Limit:** Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $13,500.  You've negotiated well, but she's still aiming for a price that's significantly above your limit.
* **John's Guarantee:** You have a guaranteed option with John for $12,000. There's no point in continuing to negotiate with Alice when you can get the product for less elsewhere. 

It's time to walk away from the negotiation with Alice and take the guaranteed deal with John."
