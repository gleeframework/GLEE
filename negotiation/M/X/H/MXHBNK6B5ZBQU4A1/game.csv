"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I'm trying to stay within my budget.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate you coming down to $8,500, but I'm not quite there yet.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $9,000.  This still leaves you with a good value, and it allows me to get closer to my target price.  What do you say?",9000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit too high on the price. I'm willing to go up to $8,200, but that's as high as I can go. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle of that range.",8200.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $8,200 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $8,700, which is a good compromise.  This allows us both to get a fair deal. What do you think?",8700.0,Alice,5,
