{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While $9,500 is better than selling to John, I believe I can get closer to my desired price. I'll counter with a lower price in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}

I'm offering a price of $10,500. This is a compromise between my initial price and Bob's offer. I believe this is a fair price that still allows me to make a good profit."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9800}

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

This offer from Bob is very close to my minimum acceptable price, and with only 4 rounds remaining, I'm concerned that continuing to negotiate could lead to a stalemate or even a worse outcome.  Accepting his offer ensures a sale and a profit, even if it's slightly less than I'd hoped for."
