"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. This is a great deal for you, as it's below market value. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's still significantly lower than my minimum value but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Framing:** I'm highlighting the deal's value for Bob by mentioning it being below market value.
* **Open to Negotiation:** My message indicates willingness to negotiate, making Bob more likely to counteroffer instead of immediately rejecting."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $10,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $6,000? I think that's a fair price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  $6,000 is significantly below my minimum value of $12,000, and even below my initial offer of $10,000. Accepting this would result in a substantial loss.
* **Potential for a Better Deal:** I believe there is room for negotiation, and I can potentially get a higher price by making a counteroffer.
* **John is a Backup:**  Selling to John is always an option if negotiations with Bob fail, so I'm not under pressure to accept a low offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $6,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $8,500. This is still a great deal for you, considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 8500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer:**  I'm rejecting Bob's offer and proposing a counter-offer that is still significantly higher than his offer, but lower than my initial offer, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate.
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to encourage him to consider a higher price. 
* **Finding Middle Ground:** I'm explicitly suggesting a desire to find a middle ground, implying a willingness to compromise further if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that $6,000 is low, but $8,500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about meeting in the middle at $7,250? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too Low:** While Bob's offer is higher than his previous one, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. 
* **Room for Negotiation:**  Bob is showing willingness to negotiate, and I believe there is potential for a higher counteroffer from him. 
* **John is a Safe Option:**  Selling to John for $12,000 is always available, giving me the flexibility to decline this offer and explore more favorable options."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your effort to find a compromise.  $7,250 is still a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to go down to $8,000. This price reflects the value of the product, and I believe it's a fair deal for both of us. Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer:** I'm rejecting Bob's offer and proposing a counter-offer that is closer to my desired price, showing that I'm willing to negotiate but not settling for a low price.
* **Emphasize Fairness:**  I'm framing my counteroffer as a ""fair deal"" for both of us to encourage Bob to accept.
* **Closure Focus:** I'm expressing a desire to close the deal to signal that I'm serious about reaching an agreement and make Bob more likely to consider my offer seriously."
