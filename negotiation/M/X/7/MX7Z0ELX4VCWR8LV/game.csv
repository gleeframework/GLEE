"I really like the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, and I understand your budget constraints. However, $1,200,000 is simply too low for me to consider.  I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000, which I believe is still a great deal for you considering the product's value and its potential benefits. This price reflects a significant compromise on my part, and I hope you'll give it serious consideration.",1400000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to meet you at $1,250,000, which is the highest price I can afford. I hope we can come to an agreement.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your financial constraints, but $1,250,000 is still significantly lower than what I need to make this deal worthwhile. To show you I'm committed to finding a solution, I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This is a significant move for me, and I believe it represents a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can bridge this gap and finalize this deal.",1350000.0,Alice,5,
