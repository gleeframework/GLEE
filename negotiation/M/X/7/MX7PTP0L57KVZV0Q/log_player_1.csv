Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. I know it's worth a lot to me, but I'm hoping we can come to a fair agreement. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $12,000, knowing it's above Bob's perceived value. This gives me room to negotiate down if necessary.
* **Fairness:**  I'm emphasizing a ""fair"" agreement to make Bob feel like he's getting a good deal, increasing his chances of accepting.
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffers:** I want to leave some room for Bob to counter without me immediately rejecting his offer.  This keeps the negotiation open. 
* **Backup Plan:** Remember, I can always sell to John for $15,000 if negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Counteroffer:**  Bob's offer of $9,000 is significantly closer to my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  This means there's still room for negotiation.
* **Potential for a Higher Price:**  I believe I can get a better price than $9,000. Bob has expressed interest, and I can use that interest to my advantage.
* **Not Selling to John Yet:**  While $15,000 is my minimum, I'm not desperate to sell to John right away. There's still a good chance of getting closer to that price with Bob. 

**Next Steps:**

I will counter Bob's offer with a price slightly above $9,000, aiming to reach a mutually acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I appreciate you coming back with a counteroffer. While I'm willing to be flexible, $9,000 is a bit too low for me at this point. How about we split the difference and go with $10,500?  This still gives you a great deal and allows me to stay within my desired range."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer:**  I'm countering Bob's offer, demonstrating that I'm still interested in negotiating.
* **Splitting the Difference:**  Offering $10,500 is a compromise.  It's halfway between my previous offer ($12,000) and Bob's offer ($9,000). This shows good faith and demonstrates a willingness to meet in the middle.
* **Framing it Positively:** I'm highlighting the benefits for Bob (a ""great deal"") while emphasizing that I'm also getting a fair price. 
* **Staying Within Range:** $10,500 is still above my minimum of $15,000, so it's a reasonable starting point for the next round of negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $10000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Closing the Gap:** Bob's offer of $10,000 is getting very close to my desired price range. The difference between his offer and my minimum acceptable price is only $5,000.
* **Potential for Delay:** Rejecting Bob's offer and continuing to negotiate could lead to a lengthy back-and-forth with no guarantee of a better outcome. It's possible that Bob could lose interest or find a different seller. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** While I could potentially negotiate further, the risk of losing the deal and ending up with a lower price than $10,000 is significant.  The potential reward of a few thousand dollars more isn't worth the risk. 
* **Time Value of Money:**  Selling now and getting $10,000 is a more certain outcome than potentially waiting and getting a slightly higher price.

**Conclusion:**

Accepting Bob's offer is the most rational decision at this point. It allows me to secure a sale and receive a price that's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price."
