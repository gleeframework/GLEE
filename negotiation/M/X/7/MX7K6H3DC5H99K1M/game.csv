"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,250,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product. This is my final offer. Let me know if you're interested.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,000,000 just doesn't work for me. How about we split the difference and go with $1,125,000? It's a fair compromise, and I believe it's still a good deal for you.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",1125000.0,Alice,3,
