{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,250,000.  It's a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1250000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's a significant discount from your minimum price ($1,500,000) but still leaves some room for negotiation. It's also a fair price considering the product is worth $1,000,000 to Bob. This initial offer will allow you to gauge Bob's interest and potentially negotiate a higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,250,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product. This is my final offer. Let me know if you're interested. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $1,000,000 is a decent price, it's still far below my minimum acceptable value of $1,500,000.  I'll try to counter with a higher price to see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,000,000 just doesn't work for me. How about we split the difference and go with $1,125,000? It's a fair compromise, and I believe it's still a good deal for you.  Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1125000}
