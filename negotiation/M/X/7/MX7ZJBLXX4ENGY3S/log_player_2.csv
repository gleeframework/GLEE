Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

Let's start with a lower offer of $3,000. This is a significant discount from Alice's initial price, but still a fair starting point for negotiation."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

Alice is still too high.  We're running out of time, but let's see if we can get her closer to our target price.  We can always go to John if this doesn't work out."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

Let's offer $4,000. This is a good compromise and we're almost at our limit.  Hopefully Alice will accept it."

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

We're down to the last round and Alice isn't budging. It's better to secure the product from John at $12,000 rather than risk losing the opportunity and having to start all over with a new seller."
