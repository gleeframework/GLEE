Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $14,000 is a bit more than I'd like to pay right now.  How about $12,000? I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 12000}

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you making a counteroffer.  While I value your business, $12,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000? That's a good price for both of us, and allows us to close this deal quickly. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $13,000 is closer, I'm still hoping to get it for a bit less. How about $12,500? I think that's a fair compromise, and we can finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible. He's offering a compromise price that's closer to his desired price point but still shows he's willing to negotiate. This counteroffer demonstrates a willingness to meet halfway while still trying to get a better deal."

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $12,500 is still below what I need to make this worth it for me. I'm willing to come down a little more. How about $12,750? This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a good value for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $12,750 is now within Bob's budget and a significant improvement over her previous offer.  While Bob could continue to negotiate, he's already saved $2,250 from her initial offer and is running out of rounds.  Accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product and a decent deal."
