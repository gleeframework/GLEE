Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $14,000 is a bit more than I'd like to pay right now.  How about $12,000? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000

I'm aiming for a higher price than $12,000.  I'll try to counter Bob's offer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."

Round 3

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $13,000 is closer, I'm still hoping to get it for a bit less. How about $12,500? I think that's a fair compromise, and we can finalize this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
