"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that will bring you significant benefits. I'm willing to offer it to you for $850,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm very interested in the product, but $850,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $725,000?"",
""product_price"": 725000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  I'm starting with a significantly lower offer ($725,000) than Alice's asking price ($850,000). This leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Polite and Positive:** I want to keep the tone polite and express my interest in the product. This can encourage Alice to continue the negotiation.
* **Strategic Positioning:** My offer is closer to my maximum budget ($800,000) than Alice's starting point. This gives me some bargaining power."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $850,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $725,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so I'm offering the product to you for $787,500. This is a fair price considering the value the product will bring to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $787,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $787,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Room for Negotiation:** While Alice met me in the middle, the new price of $787,500 is still above my ideal price and very close to John's offer.
* **Leveraging John's Offer:** I know I can get the product for $800,000 from John. This gives me a strong bargaining position.
* **Calculated Risk:** Rejecting this offer carries some risk as Alice might not be willing to go much lower. However, I'm willing to take that risk to see if I can get a better deal."

""message"": ""Alice, thanks for coming down a bit. I appreciate you working with me. How about we settle on $750,000?  That would work well for me."",
""product_price"": 750000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Increase:** I'm increasing my offer, but only incrementally ($725,000 to $750,000). I want to show Alice I'm willing to move, but not drastically. 
* **Targeting a Compromise:** My offer of $750,000 is a significant step toward the middle ground between my initial offer and Alice's revised price.
* **Maintaining Pressure:**  By keeping my offer below John's price ($800,000), I'm reminding Alice that I have an alternative option."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I'm still a bit above $750,000 in my valuation of the product. I'm willing to meet you at $775,000, which is a compromise between our two numbers. This is my final offer, so I hope we can agree on this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $775,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** Alice has stated this is her final offer. 
* **Minimal Savings with John:** While I could go to John, the potential savings are only $25,000 ($800,000 - $775,000).
* **Not Worth the Risk:** Continuing the negotiation has the risk of Alice refusing to budge further and me potentially losing the deal.  

At this point, accepting Alice's offer of $775,000 is the most logical choice as it saves me a reasonable amount and avoids the risk of losing the deal entirely."
