{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Since the product is worth $12,000 to Bob, Alice's initial offer is not beneficial. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is trying to get the best possible price, but also wants to be reasonable.  Offering $10,500 is a significant discount from Alice's initial price, but still allows for some profit for Alice. This initial counteroffer gives Bob a good starting point for negotiation."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10750}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is trying to inch closer to his desired price, but needs to be mindful of the fact that he has a limited number of rounds to negotiate.  A counteroffer of $10,750 represents a smaller decrease than the previous round, showing that Bob is willing to negotiate but also that he is starting to feel the pressure of the limited rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $10,500 is now within Bob's budget and significantly lower than his initial target. Accepting this offer allows Bob to purchase the product for a price he is comfortable with, saving him $1,500 compared to buying from John. It also ensures that Bob doesn't risk losing the deal altogether by continuing to negotiate."
