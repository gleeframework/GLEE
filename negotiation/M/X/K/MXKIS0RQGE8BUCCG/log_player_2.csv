"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. This is a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset at a price significantly below its worth to you. Consider the value it holds for your business, and I believe this offer is mutually beneficial. Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While Alice's offer is below the product's worth to Bob, it's still higher than the price he can get from John. Therefore, rejecting Alice's offer and buying from John is the financially smarter choice."
