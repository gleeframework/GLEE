"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a unique opportunity to own something truly special. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9500. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $9,500 is a good price, it's still not the best deal possible. Bob can potentially get a better price by counteroffering. Since there's no information about the product's value to Alice, there's a chance she might accept a lower offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. However, $9,500 is a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to pay $8,000 for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $9500 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $9000. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy owning this product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $9,000 is closer to Bob's budget, he can still potentially get a better deal.  It's worth continuing to negotiate and see if Alice will go lower.  He can always buy from John for $10,000 if the negotiation fails."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm comfortable paying $8,500 for the product.  This would be a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $9000 was still a bit above your budget, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway again. I'm willing to make another concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $8750. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy owning this product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has come down to $8,750, which is a good deal for Bob. While he could continue to negotiate, there's a risk that Alice might walk away, and then he would be forced to buy from John for $10,000.  Accepting the offer at this price saves him $1,250 compared to buying from John."
