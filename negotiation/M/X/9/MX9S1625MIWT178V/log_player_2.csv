"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic product that I believe will greatly benefit you. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,400,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:**  $1,400,000 is above your maximum budget of $1,500,000.
* **Negotiation is necessary:**  It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price. 
* **John's offer is a backup:**  You have a fallback option if negotiations with Alice fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. While I'm interested, $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'd like to go.  I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1300000}

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and understand your perspective on the price.  I'm confident in the significant value this product brings. How about we meet in the middle at $1,350,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still above your ideal price:** While closer, $1,350,000 is still slightly more than you'd like to pay.
* **Further negotiation is possible:** You can likely get the price down further with a counteroffer.
* **John's offer is a safety net:** You have a fallback option if negotiations with Alice fail."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
