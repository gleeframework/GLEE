"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic product that I believe will greatly benefit you. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,400,000."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** We begin with a strong offer close to Bob's perceived value ($1,500,000) to establish a favorable negotiation position.
* **Leaving Room to Negotiate:**  The $100,000 gap allows for negotiation while still securing a significant profit above Alice's minimum acceptable price ($1,200,000).
* **Positive Framing:**  The message emphasizes the product's value and potential benefits for Bob, encouraging a positive response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. While I'm interested, $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'd like to go.  I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,300,000 is better than our fallback option (selling to John for $1,200,000), but it's still significantly below Bob's perceived value of the product.  We have room to negotiate and aim for a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and understand your perspective on the price.  I'm confident in the significant value this product brings. How about we meet in the middle at $1,350,000?"", 
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Seeking a Compromise:** We're moving towards a compromise by splitting the difference between Bob's offer ($1,300,000) and our previous asking price ($1,400,000). 
* **Maintaining a Strong Position:** This counteroffer still secures a significant profit above Alice's minimum price while showing a willingness to negotiate.
* **Positive Tone:**  The message maintains a collaborative tone, aiming for a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,350,000 is still a bit higher than where I'm comfortable. How about we split the difference and settle on $1,325,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,325,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Favorable Deal:** Bob's offer of $1,325,000 is a good deal for Alice. It's significantly above her minimum acceptable price ($1,200,000) and provides a strong profit.
* **Diminishing Returns:**  While we could continue negotiating, the potential gains are getting smaller.  Bob is unlikely to drastically increase his offer.
* **Time Value of Money:** Closing the deal sooner allows Alice to utilize the funds for other opportunities. Holding out for a potentially slightly higher offer carries the risk of Bob walking away altogether."
