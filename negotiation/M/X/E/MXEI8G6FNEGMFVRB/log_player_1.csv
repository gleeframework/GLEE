"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling you this product.  I believe it has the potential to be incredibly valuable for you. To kick things off, I'm offering it at $2,000,000."",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your desired price. This gives you room to negotiate and appear flexible. 
* **Gauge Bob's Interest:** This first offer will help you understand how eager Bob is to buy and how much he values the product. 
* **Alternative Option:**  Remember, you always have John waiting in the wings, willing to pay your full desired price. This gives you leverage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $2,000,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is better than his initial perceived value ($1,200,000 vs. $1,000,000), indicating there's room for negotiation. While accepting would secure a profit, it's too early to settle. We're aiming for a price closer to our minimum, and we have ample rounds and the John option for leverage."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a fair price. While your offer is appreciated, the true value of this product is significantly higher. I could consider letting it go for $1,800,000."",
""product_price"": 1800000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:**  We've lowered the price by $200,000, showing Bob we're willing to negotiate. However, the decrease is substantial enough to demonstrate seriousness about our initial valuation.
* **Maintaining Distance:**  This offer is still significantly above both Bob's initial offer and his perceived value, allowing room for further negotiation toward a mutually agreeable price.
* **Time Consideration:**  We are still early in the negotiation (Round 3). Taking larger steps down in price now could lead to leaving money on the table. We have time on our side to reach a more favorable outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,800,000 is still out of my price range.  I'm firm on my previous offer of $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to me.  Let's make this deal happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is holding firm at $1,200,000, which is a good sign he might be willing to go higher.  However, we're still significantly above his perceived value. We need to show flexibility but also signal that we're willing to walk away. We'll use our next counteroffer to strategically approach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand this is a significant investment for you.  Let's find a compromise. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. This offer reflects the product's true worth and my desire to see it put to good use."",
""product_price"": 1600000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Drop, Calculated Risk:** We're dropping $200,000 â€“ a large concession designed to signal our willingness to make a deal and motivate Bob to negotiate further. 
* **Above Bob's Limit:**  The price is still $400,000 above Bob's stated limit, leaving room for him to potentially counter. 
* **Maintaining Leverage:**  While a significant decrease, we are still substantially above John's offer, preserving our safety net and demonstrating the value we place on the product. 
* **Midway Point:** We're now five rounds in. This more aggressive move helps gauge Bob's seriousness and pushes towards a conclusion in the remaining rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,600,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000. This is a fair price, and I'm confident we can both be happy with this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Profitable Deal:** $1,400,000 is a significant profit over Bob's initial offer and his perceived value. It also demonstrates that our negotiation tactics successfully moved him upwards.
* **Time Value:** We're past the halfway point of the negotiation rounds. While we could potentially squeeze a little more, each round carries the risk of Bob walking away or us needing to make smaller concessions.
* **John as Backup:** While John offers $1,500,000, the difference now is relatively small. Accepting Bob's offer avoids the risk of further negotiation and secures a very good price.

**Overall:** This deal represents a successful negotiation outcome. We secured a price significantly higher than Bob's initial willingness to pay while still remaining aware of our alternative option with John."
