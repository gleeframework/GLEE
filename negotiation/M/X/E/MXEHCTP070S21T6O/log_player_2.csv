Round 3

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $100 is still a bit below my minimum. I'm willing to compromise and offer it to you for $125. It's the best I can do. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** 

Alice is very unlikely to go below $125.  It's better to secure the product from John at $100 than to risk the price going up or the negotiation failing altogether."
