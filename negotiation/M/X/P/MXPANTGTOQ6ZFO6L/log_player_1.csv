I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This is a good starting point because it's a significant markup from my minimum value of $10,000, but it's not so high that Bob will immediately reject it. I'm curious to see how Bob values the product and if he's willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $12,000 is a decent price, I believe I can still get closer to my desired price. I'm going to make a counteroffer in the next round to see if we can meet somewhere in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm offering $13,500.  This is halfway between my initial offer and Bob's offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise. I'm hoping Bob will see the value in the product and be willing to meet me in the middle."

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, $12,500 is still a good deal, especially considering the risk of Bob rejecting my next counteroffer or me having to sell to John for a lower price. It's time to close the deal!"
