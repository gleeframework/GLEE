Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

```

I'm starting with a high price of $2,000,000.  This is a strong opening position. Bob may counter with a lower offer, but it sets a high baseline. I'm confident in the value of my product, and I'm willing to walk away and sell to John if Bob isn't willing to meet my price.  Let's see what Bob says!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my initial offer, but still above my minimum.  I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

I'm countering with $1,750,000. This is a compromise, moving closer to Bob's offer but still maintaining a significant profit for me.  Hopefully, this will be more appealing to Bob, but I'm still prepared to walk away and sell to John if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,400,000 is close to my minimum acceptable price, and I'm concerned about further negotiation potentially lowering the price even further.  Selling to John at $1,500,000 is tempting, but it's only a $100,000 difference, and there's always a chance that further negotiation with Bob might get us closer to that number. I'm going to accept Bob's offer and finalize the sale."
