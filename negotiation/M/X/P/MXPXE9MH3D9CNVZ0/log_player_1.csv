Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a special price of $140. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price."",
""product_price"": 140
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as much money as possible from Bob before resorting to John's guaranteed $150 offer.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $140 leaves some space for Bob to potentially counter-offer, while still ensuring a significant profit above Bob's perceived value of $80. 
* **Urgency (Implied):**  By offering a ""special price,"" there's a subtle implication that this offer might not last forever, encouraging Bob to act."
