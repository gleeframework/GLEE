"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product of exceptional value. Given its unique features and potential, I'm initially offering it for $2,250,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for a mutually beneficial deal.",2250000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product, your initial offer is significantly higher than I'm willing to pay. I'm prepared to offer $800,000 for it.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you taking the time to consider this offer. However, your proposed price doesn't reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This is a significant reduction, and I believe it represents a fair deal for both of us.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer, but there's still a gap between our valuations. I can see this product being valuable to my business, but not at that price. I'm willing to increase my offer to $950,000.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to move on the price.  To be frank, we're still quite far apart. I'm open to making this work, but I need to see a significant step from your side to justify continuing this negotiation. I'm willing to consider offers around $1,700,000.",1700000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but I need you to understand mine as well. While this product could be beneficial, $1,700,000 is simply too high.  I'm willing to offer $1,100,000.  This is a substantial increase on my part and demonstrates my seriousness about this purchase.",1100000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate that you've raised your offer considerably.  However, I need to be upfront â€“ to make this deal worthwhile for me, we need to be closer to the $1,600,000 mark. I'm confident this product will exceed your expectations, and I'm willing to work with you on this. Let's find a way to make this happen.",1600000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting into the later stages of this negotiation, and I need to see some real movement. I'm willing to go up to $1,200,000, but that's my absolute limit. If this works for you, we have a deal.  If not, I'll need to seriously consider my alternative options.",1200000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate how far we've come in this negotiation. However, based on my own analysis and other opportunities, I need to be realistic about my bottom line. To make this work, I would need a price of $1,525,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's more than fair considering the value this product brings.",1525000.0,Alice,9,
