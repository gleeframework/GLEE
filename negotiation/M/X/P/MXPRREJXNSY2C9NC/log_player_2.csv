Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate how far we've come in this negotiation. However, based on my own analysis and other opportunities, I need to be realistic about my bottom line.

# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,525,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,525,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is unlikely to go below her ""final offer"".  While her price is getting closer to reasonable, it's still significantly more than the guaranteed $1,000,000 from John. It's not worth the risk of continuing the negotiation with Alice when there's a better deal on the table."
