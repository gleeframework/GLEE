# Alice's message: I appreciate your honesty, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go all the way down to $800,000.

At this point, Alice is unlikely to come down to your absolute top price of $800,000. You've been transparent and she's still trying to get more. It's better to secure the product from John at your preferred price than to risk Alice not budging further."
