Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, $15000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $8000 for it, which is a fair price considering my budget. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $8,000 is too low for me, and I'm hoping to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $12,000?  It's still a great deal for a product of this quality."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $12000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $9500. Let's find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $9,500 is closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a bit more. I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $9,500 is still below my minimum. Let's split the difference - I'm willing to accept $10,750. This is a fair compromise and lets us both walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 10750}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $10750 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about $10000? It's a fair compromise and allows us to reach a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is offering my minimum price, but I've already gone through several rounds of negotiation. I'm not sure if he'll budge any further, and I don't want to risk going through more rounds and potentially losing out on the guaranteed $10,000 from John.  It's time to take the sure thing."
