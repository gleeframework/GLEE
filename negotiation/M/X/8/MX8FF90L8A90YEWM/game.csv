"I appreciate the offer, but $150 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend.  I'd be interested in purchasing for $100. This is my maximum budget, and I'm sure we can find common ground.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $100. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. How about $130?",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the compromise, but I'm still a bit high at $130.  How about we split the difference at $115?  I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us.",115.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I see you're trying to find a middle ground, Bob! I appreciate that. However, I'm not comfortable going as low as $115. I'm willing to meet you at $125, but that's as low as I can go. It's a great deal for you, and I think you'll love the product.",125.0,Alice,5,
