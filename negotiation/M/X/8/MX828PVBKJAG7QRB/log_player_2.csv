"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase my product for $1,200,000. This is a significant discount from what I could get elsewhere, and I believe it represents a fair value for both of us.  I understand this product is worth $1,000,000 to you, so this offer gives you a chance to acquire it for a price that allows you a profit margin.  Let me know your decision.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.
