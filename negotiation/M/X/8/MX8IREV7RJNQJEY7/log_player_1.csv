"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000} 
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,500,000. This is a significant premium over my minimum acceptable value of $1,000,000. This strategy aims to:

* **Gauge Bob's interest:**  This high price will immediately tell me if Bob is seriously interested and has a high perceived value for the product.
* **Leave room for negotiation:**  I'm leaving myself space to lower the price in subsequent rounds if needed. 
* **Maximize potential profit:**  If Bob is willing to pay close to this price, it would be a great outcome. 

I'm also keeping in mind the ""John"" option.  If Bob rejects this offer, I can always sell to John for $1,000,000, ensuring I don't walk away with nothing."

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to **reject Bob's offer** for now. Here's why:

* **Potential for a better deal:** While $1,200,000 is a decent amount, it's still below my initial ask.  There's a good chance I can get closer to my target price with further negotiation.
* **Testing Bob's commitment:**  Rejecting this offer will show Bob that I'm serious about my initial price and not afraid to walk away. This might make him more likely to increase his offer in future rounds.
* **Minimizing risk:** Selling to John is still on the table if negotiations don't go well. This gives me a safety net.

By rejecting Bob's offer, I'm choosing to continue the negotiation process. I'm confident I can push for a better price, but I'm also prepared to switch to John if necessary."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

I'm sending a counteroffer of $1,400,000 to Bob. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still significantly higher than Bob's offer. Here's my reasoning:

* **Meeting halfway:**  This price is closer to Bob's offer, showing that I'm willing to negotiate and reach a compromise.
* **Maintaining leverage:**  It's still well above my minimum acceptable value, so I'm not giving away too much.  
* **Testing the waters:**  This will tell me if Bob is serious about making a deal close to my target price.

By offering this counteroffer, I'm signaling to Bob that I'm serious about making a deal, but I'm not willing to settle for his initial offer. I'm still confident I can get a better price, but I'm also prepared to sell to John if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to **reject Bob's offer** again. Here's why:

* **Too low:** $1,100,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value of $1,000,000.  Accepting this offer would mean a loss for me.
* **Remaining rounds:**  We still have several rounds left. I'm willing to continue negotiating in the hope of securing a better price closer to my target value.
* **John as a safety net:**  I'm comfortable with the fact that I can sell to John for $1,000,000, which is still above my minimum acceptable value. This ensures that I'm not risking a significant loss by continuing to negotiate.

By rejecting Bob's offer, I'm demonstrating my commitment to getting the best possible deal. I'm still optimistic that we can reach an agreement that's mutually beneficial, but I'm also prepared to walk away if necessary."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000} 
```

I'm sending a counteroffer of $1,300,000 to Bob. This price is a compromise from my previous offer, showing flexibility, but still maintaining my position. Here's why:

* **Compromise:**  This counteroffer is lower than my previous offer, indicating that I'm willing to negotiate and find common ground.
* **Minimizing risk:**  It's still significantly higher than Bob's last offer, reducing the risk of losing too much money.
* **Staying above minimum:**  It's above my minimum acceptable value, ensuring I don't settle for a losing deal.
* **Testing commitment:**  This will gauge Bob's seriousness and willingness to move closer to my desired price.

By offering this counteroffer, I'm demonstrating my commitment to reaching an agreement while still aiming for a favorable outcome.  I'm also keeping the option to sell to John open if negotiations don't yield a satisfactory result."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm going to **sell the product to John for $1,000,000**. Here's why:

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $950,000 is below my minimum acceptable value, and there's a good chance I won't be able to get Bob to increase his offer significantly in the remaining rounds.
* **Minimizing risk:** Selling to John guarantees a profit and ensures I don't walk away with nothing.
* **Limited time:** We've only got a few rounds left.  There's a risk that the negotiations will drag on without any improvement in Bob's offer.

While I'd prefer to sell to Bob at a higher price, I need to prioritize my own financial security. Selling to John guarantees a decent profit and eliminates the risk of losing money."
