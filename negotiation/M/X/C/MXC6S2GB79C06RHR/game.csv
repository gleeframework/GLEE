"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm very interested in the product, but $2,000,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to offer $1,000,000.  Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  However, $1,000,000 significantly undervalues the true potential of this product. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,700,000.",1700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand the value you see in the product, but $1,700,000 is still a bit outside my budget.  Would you consider $1,100,000? I think that's a fair offer.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,600,000.  However, I do have other interested parties, and I need to see a price that reflects the true value of this product.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
