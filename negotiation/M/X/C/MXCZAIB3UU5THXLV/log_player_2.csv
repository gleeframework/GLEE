**Reasoning:**

* **Your Goal:** Save as much money as possible.
* **Alice's Offer:** $950,000
* **John's Offer:** $1,000,000

While Alice's offer is better than John's, you can still do better.  By rejecting her offer, you can potentially negotiate a lower price with Alice or at least get her to sweeten the deal.  

**Strategy:**

* Reject Alice's offer and explain that you're willing to pay $900,000. This creates a starting point for negotiation.
* If Alice refuses, you can then purchase from John. You're guaranteed to save at least $50,000 by going this route."
