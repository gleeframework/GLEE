Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** I want to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($1,500,000) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $1,400,000 leaves some space for Bob to potentially negotiate down, while still ensuring I remain significantly above my minimum acceptable price ($1,000,000). 
* **Confidence and Exclusivity:** Highlighting the ""exclusive opportunity"" and expressing confidence in the product's value aims to make the offer more appealing to Bob.

By offering a price that's attractive to Bob yet profitable for me, I increase the likelihood of closing the deal at a higher price point than my backup option (John)."
