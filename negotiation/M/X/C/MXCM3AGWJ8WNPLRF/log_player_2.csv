# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I've done some research and understand that it's worth a significant amount to you. I'm willing to make a deal that I think you'll find attractive. I'm offering the product to you for $950,000. This is a one-time opportunity to get your hands on this valuable item, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal anywhere else. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer

``` 

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $950,000 is significantly lower than the $1,200,000 you would pay John.  While it's still above the product's value to Alice ($1,000,000), it's the best deal you can get. Accepting the offer allows you to save $250,000."
