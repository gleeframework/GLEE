"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I think it would be incredibly valuable to you. I'm asking for $14,000 to start negotiations. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $14,000 is way too high for me. This product would be useful, but not at that price.  Would you consider $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for the offer, but $6,000 is too low for me. This product is high-quality and I know it would benefit you greatly. How about we meet in the middle at $10,000?",10000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving a bit, but $10,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend. Could you do $7,000?  That would be a fair deal.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $7,000 significantly undervalues this product and what it can do for you.  I can't go any lower than $9,000.  This is my final offer.",9000.0,Alice,5,
