Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 90}
```

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's value for the product, hoping to get a good deal. I'm also aware of John's offer of $80, so I'm not afraid to walk away if Bob doesn't meet my price expectations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd like to get more, Bob's offer matches the minimum I'm willing to accept and is also the same as what John is offering. It's not worth risking further negotiation and potentially losing the sale altogether."
