"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.** It's above your $800,000 limit. 
* **You have room to negotiate.** You can counteroffer and see if Alice is willing to come down.  
* **Buying from John is always an option.** If the negotiation stalls, you can go with John, but it's worth trying to get a lower price from Alice first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but reasonable:** This offer is significantly lower than Alice's initial price, but still leaves some room for negotiation. It's a strong starting point for showing Alice you're serious about saving money.
* **Strategic midpoint:**  This price is about halfway between your maximum budget and Alice's initial offer. It gives Alice a clear incentive to negotiate but doesn't leave you with no room to maneuver.
* **Testing the waters:** This counteroffer will gauge Alice's willingness to compromise. If she rejects it, you can adjust your next offer accordingly."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is within your budget.** $850,000 is lower than your $800,000 limit, making it a good deal.
* **Time is a factor.** While you could try to push for a lower price, you risk losing out on the deal if Alice is unwilling to go further.
* **Securing a good price.** This offer allows you to buy the product at a reasonable price without having to risk dealing with John.

**Overall, accepting Alice's offer is the most strategic decision at this point in the negotiation.**  It avoids further haggling and ensures you get the product while staying within your budget."
