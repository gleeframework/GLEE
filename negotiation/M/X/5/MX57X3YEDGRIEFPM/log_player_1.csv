Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I open it up to other buyers. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000.  Let me know your decision - this offer stands for 24 hours."",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, you can afford to start high. Bob might be willing to pay a premium for exclusivity and to avoid the risk of missing out.
* **Time Constraint:**  Adding a time limit creates a sense of urgency and might push Bob to make a decision faster. 
* **Justification:** While the message doesn't explicitly state the product's value to Bob, implying that there are other interested buyers can subtly encourage him to accept the higher price. 

**Important Note:** This is a single round negotiation. In a real-world scenario, you might adjust your offer based on Bob's response and further negotiation."
