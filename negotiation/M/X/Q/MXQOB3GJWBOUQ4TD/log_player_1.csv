{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal considering its value. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's a bit lower than my minimum value, but it leaves room for negotiation and potentially a win-win situation. I'm also trying to be friendly and encouraging to make Bob feel more likely to engage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

Bob's offer is too low. While I want to close the deal, I am not willing to sell for less than $10,000. I'll send a counteroffer in the next round."

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not sure I can go up to $10,000. How about $9,500? I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500

While $9,500 is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum value. I'm not willing to sell for anything less than $10,000. I'll send a counteroffer in the next round."

Bob's offer:

Bob is not budging on his price, and I'm not willing to sell for less than $10,000.  It's time to cut my losses and sell to John for the full value."
