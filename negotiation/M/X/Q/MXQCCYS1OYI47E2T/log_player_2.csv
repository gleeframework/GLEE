"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $10,000.  I'm open to discussing further, but I believe this is a fair starting point considering its worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Round 2

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your interest. While I appreciate your offer, $6,000 is significantly below its true value.  How about we meet in the middle at $8,500?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  While $8,500 is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $7,000.  Would you be willing to meet me there?"", ""product_price"": 7000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand where you're coming from.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us. How about $8,000? This is my final offer, as I know I can get that from another buyer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

It's unlikely Alice will go lower than $8,000, and you can get it for the same price from John. There's no point in risking further negotiation."
