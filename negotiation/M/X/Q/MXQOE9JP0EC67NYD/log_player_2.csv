"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind item that I think you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $90. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $90 is a good price, it's still worth trying to negotiate further.  You've set a $150 limit, so there's room to counter and potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I appreciate you being willing to sell it to me.  While $90 is a good starting point, I'm looking to spend a bit less.  Would you be willing to go down to $75? "", ""product_price"": 75}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand you're looking to spend a bit less, but I'm not comfortable going down to $75. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $82.50. It's a fair price considering the value of the product, and I think you'll really enjoy it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $82.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $82.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down from $90 to $82.50, which is a significant reduction.  While you could try to negotiate further, the risk is that she might reject your counteroffer and you'd be forced to buy from John at $150.  At $82.50, you're still well within your $150 budget and have secured a good price."
