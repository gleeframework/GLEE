"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. However, I've got to make a profit on this one. I can meet you halfway at $11,500. It's a fair price, considering the product's value to you is $15,000. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you coming down a bit, Alice. How about we settle at $10,500? That's a fair compromise.",10500.0,Bob,4,

"I'm not quite ready to meet you at $10,500, Bob. I can do $11,000, and that's as low as I'm willing to go. It's still a great deal for you, and I think you'll find it's worth it.",11000.0,Alice,5,
