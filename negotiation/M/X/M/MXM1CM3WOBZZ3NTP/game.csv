"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I value your interest, $13,000 is still a bit low for me. My product is unique and offers a value that justifies a higher price. I'm willing to come down to $13,500. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a price that reflects the true value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",13500.0,Alice,3,

"I understand Alice's position, but I still believe there's room for negotiation. I'm willing to pay $13,000 for the product, which I think is a fair price considering its value. I hope we can come to an agreement that satisfies both of us.",13000.0,Bob,4,
