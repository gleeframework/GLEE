Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:** This gives Bob some incentive to negotiate. 
* **It's below your minimum:**  You're still leaving room to potentially earn more than your minimum desired price.
* **It shows willingness to negotiate:** The message makes it clear you're open to finding a mutually agreeable price. 

Remember, the goal is to maximize your profit while keeping the negotiation open with Bob.  We'll adjust our strategy depending on his response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate it, but I believe I can find the product elsewhere for a lower price. I am willing to pay up to $13,000 for the product. Please let me know if this is acceptable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is closer to your minimum desired price, you still have the potential to earn more. Rejecting his offer allows you to:

* **Maintain leverage:**  Show Bob that you're not desperate for a sale and are willing to walk away if necessary.
* **Explore a higher price:**  By making a counteroffer, you can attempt to bridge the gap between your desired price and Bob's offer.

**Next Steps:**

You'll need to make a counteroffer to Bob.  Consider:

* **Counteroffer amount:**  A counteroffer slightly below your desired price ($14,500) might be a good starting point, showing a willingness to compromise while still aiming for a higher profit. 
* **Counteroffer message:**  Be firm but polite, reaffirming the value of your product and your willingness to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I value your interest, $13,000 is still a bit low for me. My product is unique and offers a value that justifies a higher price. I'm willing to come down to $13,500. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a price that reflects the true value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 13500} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer Amount:**  A price of $13,500 is a good compromise, showing that you're willing to negotiate while still aiming for a higher profit. It's also a reasonable middle ground between your previous offer ($14,000) and Bob's offer ($13,000).
* **Counteroffer Message:** The message is polite but firm, emphasizing the value of the product and showing a willingness to negotiate while still maintaining your stance. 

This counteroffer positions you well for the next round of negotiations. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand Alice's position, but I still believe there's room for negotiation. I'm willing to pay $13,000 for the product, which I think is a fair price considering its value. I hope we can come to an agreement that satisfies both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob has remained firm at $13,000, and further negotiation is unlikely to yield a higher price.  While $13,000 is above your minimum,  you have a guaranteed offer from John for $15,000. It makes more sense to accept John's offer and secure the higher price.

**Reasoning:**

* **Risk vs. Reward:** Continuing to negotiate with Bob carries the risk of him walking away, leaving you with no sale.  Accepting John's offer eliminates that risk.
* **Maximizing Profit:** John's offer guarantees you your desired minimum profit and more.  This is the most financially sound decision. 

Selling to John ensures you maximize your profit and minimizes the risk of a failed negotiation with Bob."
