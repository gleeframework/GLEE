I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, hoping to leave room for negotiation.  I'm also being friendly and optimistic in my message to encourage a positive response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $120 is better than nothing, I'm not willing to sell for that low of a price yet.  I'm still confident I can get closer to my desired price point with further negotiation."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

I'm still holding out for a bit more.  $130 is getting closer, but I'm not quite ready to give in yet. I'm confident I can get closer to my target price with continued negotiations."
