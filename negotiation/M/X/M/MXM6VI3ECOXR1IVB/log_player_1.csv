"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you countering. I understand your perspective, but $900,000 is significantly below its true value.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This offer reflects the product's worth while still acknowledging your interest."", 
""product_price"": 1050000

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit above my target budget. Would you be willing to consider $950,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** We're still significantly above John's offer, and Bob's counteroffers are increasing. It's worth another round of negotiation to see if we can get closer to $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your persistence. I see you're serious about this. To meet you halfway, I can offer $1,000,000. This is my final offer, as it reflects a fair price for both of us."",
""product_price"": 1000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** This counter-offer shows Bob we're willing to compromise but holds firm on a strong price. 
* **Finality:**  By stating it's our final offer, we create a sense of urgency and encourage Bob to make a decision.
* **Strong Position:**  We're still well above John's offer, giving us leverage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still a bit above my target budget. Would you be willing to consider $975,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Offer:** $975,000 is a very good offer, significantly exceeding our fallback option of John's $800,000. 
* **Diminishing Returns:**  Continuing to negotiate might yield slightly more, but the risk of Bob walking away increases. Getting closer to $1,000,000 was a good goal, but this offer is already a substantial win.
* **Time Value of Money:** Closing the deal now allows us to reinvest the funds sooner rather than later."
