"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly less than what it's worth to you, and it's a fantastic return on my investment.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $950,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $700,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is too low.  While I'm open to negotiating, I won't accept a price that's significantly below my minimum threshold. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $700,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer. How about $850,000?  This is still a great price for you, considering the value of the product to you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. How about $775,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $775,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still below my minimum threshold.  I'm willing to keep negotiating, but I'll need a higher offer to make this worthwhile for me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $775,000 is still a bit low for me. Let's split the difference. How about $812,500? This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to reach an agreement quickly. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 812500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While $812,500 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit over my budget.  I'm willing to offer $790,000.  This keeps us moving towards a fair deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $790,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $790,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I've reached a point where Bob's offers are getting closer to my minimum, but still not quite there.  While I could continue negotiating, I'm concerned about running out of rounds.  To ensure I get at least my minimum, I'll sell to John for $800,000."
