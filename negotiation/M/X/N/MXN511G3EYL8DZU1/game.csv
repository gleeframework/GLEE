"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm asking for $20,000. What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I think $20,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $12,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but $12,000 is quite a bit lower than I can go. How about we meet in the middle at $17,000? It's a steal for the value you're getting.",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $17,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $14,000, but I think that's as high as I can go. Can you consider that?",14000.0,Bob,4,
