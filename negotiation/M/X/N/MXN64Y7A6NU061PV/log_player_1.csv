Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it's worth a great deal and would be happy to sell it for $10,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $8,000, you have leverage to start with a higher offer to Bob. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Offering the product at $10,000 leaves room for potential negotiation. Bob might try to haggle the price down, and you can still settle for a price higher than $8,000.
* **Polite and Professional Tone:** The message is phrased politely to encourage a positive interaction and potential sale."
