"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I think it would be incredibly beneficial for you.  Given its value and features, I'm offering it at $22,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $22,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your offer is way too high for me. Given my budget, I can only offer $8,000 for the product. If you're willing to come down to that price, we have a deal."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $8,000 is significantly less than what the product is worth. Let's find a middle ground. How about we agree on $18,000? This would still be a great deal for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice has come down in price, $18,000 is still above Bob's budget.  Bob should reject the offer and continue negotiating for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my budget, but $18,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $10,000. Let's see if we can find a compromise here."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for the counter offer. I'm seeing you're serious about this product.  To be honest, $15,000 is the absolute lowest I can go. It's a very fair price considering the value it will bring you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $15,000 is still above Bob's budget, and it's clear Alice isn't willing to go lower.  Since Bob has the option to buy the product from John for $8,000, it's the most financially sound decision to go with John. Continuing to negotiate with Alice risks reaching the end of the 10 rounds with no agreement, leaving Bob with no product and no money saved."
