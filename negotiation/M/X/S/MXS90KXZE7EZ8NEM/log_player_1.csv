``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's above Bob's estimated value of $1,000,000, but still leaves room for negotiation. It also leaves room for me to adjust the price if necessary, based on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to save as much as I can. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product. I think that's a fair price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my desired price, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable value of $1,500,000. I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,100,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. This price reflects the value of the product and allows us both to walk away satisfied. Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but I'm still looking to save some money. I'm willing to meet you halfway and pay $1,125,000 for the product. I think this is a reasonable compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,125,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,125,000 is still below my minimum acceptable value of $1,500,000.  While I could continue to negotiate, it's clear that Bob is unlikely to meet my price.  Therefore, I will sell the product to John for $1,500,000."
