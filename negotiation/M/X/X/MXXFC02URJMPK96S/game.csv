"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,250,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, though. I'm offering you the product for $1,350,000. This is a fair price considering the value it brings to you, and it also allows me to make a profit. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $1,350,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I'm really interested in the product, and I'm willing to make a serious offer. Can you meet me at this price?",1200000.0,Bob,4,
