"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. It's a great deal for you, as you know it's worth $800,000 to you. I'm confident it will be a valuable asset for your business. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While the product is worth $800,000 to Bob, Alice's offer of $950,000 is still too high. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially save some money."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $900,000 is my absolute minimum.  This still gives you a good deal, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product to you.  Let's make this happen!

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's price has come down, it's still higher than Bob's target.  There's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer gives Bob another opportunity to try and secure a better deal."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I hear you, but $875,000 is still below my minimum. I'm willing to go down to $890,000, which is a fair compromise considering the value of the product to you.  Let's finalize this deal.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's final offer of $890,000 is only $90,000 higher than Bob's target of $800,000.  Given that there's a high chance of Alice sticking to her minimum, accepting the offer is the best option.  Further negotiation might lead to a lower price, but there's also a risk of Alice walking away or Bob needing to buy from John at the higher price of $800,000."
