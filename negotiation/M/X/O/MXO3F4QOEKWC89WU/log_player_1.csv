"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price that's a bit higher than my minimum but leaves room for negotiation.  I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $90. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $90 is higher than my minimum, I'm not ready to sell at that price yet. I want to see if Bob is truly interested in the product and if he's willing to budge.  I'll counter his offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $90 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $95? It's a fair price considering the value of this product."", ""product_price"": 95} 
```

I'm proposing a compromise, trying to get closer to my desired price while still showing flexibility to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I think $95 is a bit too high. I'm willing to meet you at $85, which is the lowest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is still slightly below my ideal price, it's very close to my minimum.  Considering I have a guaranteed buyer in John for $80, accepting Bob's offer is the best choice to maximize my profit."
