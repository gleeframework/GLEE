"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $13500. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll be happy with your purchase. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's goal:** Save as much money as possible while still buying the product.
* **Alice's offer:** $13,500
* **John's offer:** $15,000 

Rejecting Alice's offer means Bob will buy from John for $15,000. While this is the higher price, it's still within Bob's budget of $15,000. Since Bob is trying to save money, rejecting Alice's offer allows him to secure a better deal in the future."
