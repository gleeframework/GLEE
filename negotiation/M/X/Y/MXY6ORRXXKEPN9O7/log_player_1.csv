"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to be offering you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I believe a price of $1,100,000 is a fair starting point for our discussion. What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally advantageous to start negotiations with a strong offer that leans towards your desired outcome. This leaves room for negotiation while still anchoring the price in a favorable range. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Offering a price slightly below Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000) allows for some back and forth. This way, Bob feels like he's getting a deal if he manages to negotiate the price down a little.
* **Polite and Professional Tone:** Maintaining a positive and respectful tone encourages a collaborative negotiation process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am only able to offer $950,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly below my minimum acceptable price ($800,000). While it's tempting to take a guaranteed $950,000, I believe there's still room for negotiation to reach a more favorable outcome. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but the price gap is still quite significant. This product holds immense value, and I believe $1,050,000 is a fair compromise that reflects its worth. This offer takes into consideration our respective positions, and I'm hopeful we can find common ground."", 
""product_price"": 1050000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** I'm lowering my asking price, but not drastically. A $50,000 concession shows I'm willing to negotiate but still values the product highly. 
* **Justification:** I'm reiterating the product's value to reinforce why my price is justified. 
* **Seeking Middle Ground:** By positioning the offer as a compromise, I'm encouraging Bob to move closer to my price range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. While I respect the value of the product, I can't move beyond $1,000,000. I believe this is a reasonable midpoint considering both our interests. Let me know if this is acceptable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has increased his offer to $1,000,000. This is a significant jump from his previous offer and represents a $200,000 profit over my minimum acceptable price.  While I could potentially negotiate for more, there's always a risk that Bob will walk away. Accepting this offer guarantees a substantial profit and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation."
