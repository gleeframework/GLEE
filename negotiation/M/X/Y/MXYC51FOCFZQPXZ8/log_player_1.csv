Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product at a special price of $119. I believe it will be very valuable to you."", 
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($100) as possible while still exceeding your minimum selling price ($120).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting slightly above Bob's perceived value allows room for negotiation if he tries to haggle.
* **Guaranteed Sale:** If Bob rejects the offer, you can still sell it to John for your minimum price. 

This strategy aims to secure the highest possible profit from Bob while having a safety net in John."
