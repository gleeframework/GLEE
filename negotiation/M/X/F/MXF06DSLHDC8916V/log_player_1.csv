I'm offering the product to Bob for $2,000,000. This is a significant markup from my guaranteed minimum value of $1,500,000, but it allows for potential negotiation and a higher profit if Bob is willing to pay.  If he rejects, I have a guaranteed sale with John, so there's no downside to asking for a higher price."
