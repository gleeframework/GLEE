I'm starting with a price that is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable value, hoping to maximize my profit. It's a high starting point, but I'm willing to negotiate further.  I'm also aware that I can always fall back to John's offer if Bob is unwilling to pay a reasonable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable value, but I believe I can still get a better price. I'm going to reject his offer and make a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000}
```

I'm coming down from my initial price, but still trying to secure a good price. I'm hoping Bob will recognize the value of the product and meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable value. While I would prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, it's clear that Bob isn't willing to go any higher.  At this point, it's better to accept his offer and secure the sale than to risk losing the deal altogether."
