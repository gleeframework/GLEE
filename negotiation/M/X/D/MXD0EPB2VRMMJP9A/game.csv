"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its worth, I'm proposing an initial price of $1,500,000. I believe this reflects its true value, but I'm open to discussing further.",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I think the product is worth less than $1,500,000. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price.  While $1,200,000 is a substantial offer, I believe the product's unique value justifies a higher price point. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000.  This offer reflects a balance between its worth and your initial proposal.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for considering my previous offer, Alice. I understand your perspective on the product's value, but I'm still not willing to pay $1,350,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,250,000. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the product's worth to me.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
