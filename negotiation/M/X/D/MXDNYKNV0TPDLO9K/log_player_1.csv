{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $110. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

This offer is above Bob's value of $80 but below my minimum of $120. This gives Bob some room to negotiate, but it also ensures I'm making a profit.  I'm keeping John in mind as a safety net if negotiations fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer but $110 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $90 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $90 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $120.  I'll try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $90 is simply too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $100? I think that's a fair price for both of us. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 100}
