Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000, reflecting a good compromise for both of us. This price still leaves room for your desired profit, and it's closer to what I believe the product is worth.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.
