"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $13,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer.  How about $16,000? This would allow us both to get a fair deal. ",16000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but $16,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $14,500. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",14500.0,Bob,4,
