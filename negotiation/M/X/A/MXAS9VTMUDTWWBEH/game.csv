"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While your initial offer is quite low, I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. I believe this reflects the true value of the product and represents a fair deal for both of us.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I'm seeing a willingness to find common ground here, which I appreciate.  How about we split the difference and settle on $1,250,000? This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges the product's value while working for you.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
