I'm starting with a price of $1,500,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price, but it allows room for negotiation and ensures a good profit if Bob accepts. I'm confident that I can get at least $1,200,000 from John if needed, so I'm not risking a huge loss.  Let's see what Bob says!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is far too low. I need to at least get $1,200,000 to make this worthwhile. I'm going to reject his offer and try to get closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,300,000. This is a significant drop from my initial offer but still above my minimum. I'm hoping this shows Bob that I'm serious about negotiating, but I'm not willing to give away too much. Let's see if he bites!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While I'd prefer to get more, Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price. However, I'm still not comfortable going below $1,200,000.  I don't want to risk getting stuck with a deal that doesn't meet my needs. I'm going to sell to John for $1,200,000. It's a guaranteed sale and will ensure I get the minimum I'm comfortable with."
