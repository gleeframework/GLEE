"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I'm confident you'll love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $950,000 is still above your maximum budget and you know John offers the product for $1,000,000. By rejecting Alice's offer, you can try to negotiate a better price with her or proceed to buy from John as your backup option."
