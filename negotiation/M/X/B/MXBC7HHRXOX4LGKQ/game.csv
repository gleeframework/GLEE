"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest in the product. I'm happy to start the negotiations at $2,300,000. I believe this price reflects the true value of what's being offered.",2300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value of the product,  $2,300,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to offer $850,000 for it. This is a fair price considering my budget and the potential value of the product for me.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your budget constraints, however, $850,000 is significantly below the market value of this product. I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000. This offer reflects the product's worth and allows for a reasonable negotiation.",2000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $2,000,000 is still too high for me. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $850,000. This is a fair price considering my budget and the product's value to me. Let's try to bridge the gap and reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm sensing some hesitancy on your end. While I'm motivated to find a solution that works for both of us, I also have other interested buyers. To be fair to everyone's time, I'm willing to drop to $1,750,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it's more than reasonable given the value this product offers.",1750000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However,  $1,750,000 is still quite a bit higher than what I can afford.  I'm prepared to offer $1,000,000. This represents a significant compromise on my part and reflects a price that is closer to the value I see in this product. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, your latest offer tells me you're serious, and I respect that. However, I need to be equally serious about the value of what I'm offering. Let's make this simple: $1,600,000, and we have a deal. This is a non-negotiable offer.  I need a decision from you on this round.",1600000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,600,000 is still out of my budget. I'm willing to go to $1,100,000. This represents a significant compromise and demonstrates my commitment to finding a solution that works for both of us. We're close, let's try to bridge this gap.",1100000.0,Bob,8,
