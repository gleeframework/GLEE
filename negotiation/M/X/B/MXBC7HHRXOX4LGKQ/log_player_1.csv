"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value of the product,  $2,300,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to offer $850,000 for it. This is a fair price considering my budget and the potential value of the product for me.  Let's see if we can find some common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your budget constraints, however, $850,000 is significantly below the market value of this product. I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000. This offer reflects the product's worth and allows for a reasonable negotiation."",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $2,000,000 is still too high for me. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $850,000. This is a fair price considering my budget and the product's value to me. Let's try to bridge the gap and reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is holding firm, but his offer is too far below the product's value to me. I'll counteroffer again, but I need to start moving towards a price where I might consider selling to John if Bob doesn't budge significantly soon."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm sensing some hesitancy on your end. While I'm motivated to find a solution that works for both of us, I also have other interested buyers. To be fair to everyone's time, I'm willing to drop to $1,750,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it's more than reasonable given the value this product offers."",
""product_price"": 1750000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your perspective, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However,  $1,750,000 is still quite a bit higher than what I can afford.  I'm prepared to offer $1,000,000. This represents a significant compromise on my part and reflects a price that is closer to the value I see in this product. Let's find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob's offer has increased substantially, but it's still less than what John is offering.  I'll counteroffer one more time, but I'm getting close to selling to John if Bob doesn't meet me much closer to my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, your latest offer tells me you're serious, and I respect that. However, I need to be equally serious about the value of what I'm offering. Let's make this simple: $1,600,000, and we have a deal. This is a non-negotiable offer.  I need a decision from you on this round."",
""product_price"": 1600000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  I'm drawing a line in the sand. This price is my bottom line, allowing for a small buffer above John's offer to account for the time pressure. By making it clear this is my final offer, I'm increasing the pressure on Bob to make a decision."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $1,600,000 is still out of my budget. I'm willing to go to $1,100,000. This represents a significant compromise and demonstrates my commitment to finding a solution that works for both of us. We're close, let's try to bridge this gap. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob hasn't moved significantly enough to justify continuing the negotiation. He's still well below John's offer, and I've already presented my final offer. It's time to cut my losses with Bob and secure the guaranteed $1,500,000 from John."
