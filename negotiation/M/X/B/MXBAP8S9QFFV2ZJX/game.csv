"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. Could you consider meeting me halfway at $90?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference - how about $95?  This is a fair price, and it gets us closer to an agreement.",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $95 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $92. Can you consider that?",92.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $92 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to get closer to $100. How about we meet at $97? This is my final offer, and I'm not sure I can go lower. ",97.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand that you're trying to get closer to your original price, but $97 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $92 again, but I'm not sure I can go any higher. Can you reconsider?",92.0,Bob,6,
