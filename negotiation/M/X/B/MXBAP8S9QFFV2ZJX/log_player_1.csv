"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $100. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's above Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation. It also demonstrates my willingness to negotiate.  Let's see what Bob says!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. Could you consider meeting me halfway at $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still too low.  I need to get closer to my minimum of $120.  I'll counteroffer, but I'll keep in mind that if negotiations don't improve quickly, I can always go with John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference - how about $95?  This is a fair price, and it gets us closer to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 95} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $95 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $92. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $92 is closer to my minimum, it's still not enough. I'm willing to keep negotiating, but I'm also aware that John is a sure thing at $120.  I need to be careful not to waste too much time with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $92 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to get closer to $100. How about we meet at $97? This is my final offer, and I'm not sure I can go lower. "", ""product_price"": 97} 
```

This offer is a compromise, but it's still above Bob's latest offer and closer to my desired price. I'm also using language to signal that I'm close to my limit, hoping to push Bob to make a final decision."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that you're trying to get closer to your original price, but $97 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $92 again, but I'm not sure I can go any higher. Can you reconsider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

We've reached a stalemate with Bob.  He's unwilling to budge, and I'm not willing to go any lower than $97. It's time to cut my losses and sell to John.  While I would have liked to get closer to my ideal price,  I need to secure a sale."
