Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1200000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $800,000, you can afford to start high. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially a much higher profit.
* **Justification:** While the message doesn't explicitly state why the price is so high,  it hints at the product's value. This allows Bob to counter-offer without feeling insulted. 
* **Testing the waters:** This initial offer helps gauge Bob's interest level and gives you insight into his perception of the product's worth."
