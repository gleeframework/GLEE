Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the market demand. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```
 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's still too low. I can likely get a better price by continuing negotiations with him. I'm not willing to sell to John yet, as I believe I can get closer to my desired price of $1,450,000."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,300,000 is still significantly below my expectations. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I'm offering $1,400,000.

Let's find a solution that benefits both parties."", ""product_price"": 1400000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $1,350,000 is closer to my goal, I'm still confident that I can negotiate a higher price. I'm not willing to settle yet, and I believe I can push for a better deal in the next round. Selling to John at this point would mean losing out on a potentially better offer, so I'm going to continue the negotiations."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However,  $1,350,000 is still quite a bit lower than my bottom line. Let's meet in the middle. I'm offering $1,375,000.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

With only two rounds remaining, the negotiations with Bob haven't yielded a price that meets my minimum requirements.  I'm not confident I can get a higher price in the next round. To avoid risking losing any money, I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,200,000. It's not my ideal price, but it's a safe and secure way to ensure I get something for the product."
