"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. While $950,000 is within his budget, it's still a significant amount.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price.  There are still 9 rounds left, giving Bob ample opportunity to try and get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a significant discount.  Offering $850,000 is a good starting point, as it's still a profitable deal for Alice (being above her $800,000 valuation). This aggressive counteroffer shows Bob's seriousness in negotiating and sets the stage for further bargaining."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high.  Bob wants to get the price as close to his desired range as possible.  While he could buy from John, there's still room for negotiation with Alice, and rejecting her offer allows him to continue to try and get a better deal.  Bob has a chance to explore lower price points and potentially close the gap further in the remaining rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 880000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is slowly increasing his offer, showing willingness to compromise while still trying to secure a good price. $880,000 is a middle ground between his previous offer and Alice's latest offer.  It's still within Alice's profit margin while being a significant saving for Bob. With 6 rounds remaining, there's still time for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is a better offer than before, Bob is still trying to push for a lower price. He wants to see if he can close the deal closer to his desired range.  He has 5 rounds left, which is enough time to continue negotiations. There's a chance Alice might be willing to budge a bit more, especially as the rounds progress."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 890000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is now getting closer to Alice's last offer.  $890,000 is a small increase from his previous offer, showing his commitment to reaching an agreement while still maintaining a price point that benefits him.  With 4 rounds remaining, the pressure is starting to mount, but Bob wants to see if he can get Alice to meet him halfway."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has stuck to her $900,000 offer.  While Bob would prefer a lower price, he's now in a tricky situation.  Only 3 rounds remain, and the risk of Alice's offer increasing or becoming unavailable is real. Buying from John for $1,000,000 is a worse option, making accepting Alice's offer the best course of action at this point.  He's saving $100,000 compared to buying from John, and it's likely he won't get a significantly better deal from Alice in the remaining rounds."
