Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,800,000. This is a fair price considering its value and the market potential. I'm confident you'll see a strong return on your investment. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1800000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable value of $1,200,000. This gives me room to negotiate downwards.
* **Highlighting value:** I'm emphasizing the potential value and return on investment for Bob. This could encourage him to consider my offer seriously.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** The message implies that I'm open to negotiation, which could make Bob feel more comfortable making a counteroffer. 
* **Having a backup:**  Remember, I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, so I'm not desperate to sell to Bob at any price. This gives me leverage in negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the value of your product, I am only willing to pay $1600000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering my budget and the current market conditions. I look forward to your response. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is still above my minimum:** While it's lower than my initial offer, it's still above my minimum acceptable value of $1,200,000. This means I have room to negotiate further. 
* **Potential for a better deal:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I can try to get closer to my desired price. I'm confident I can get a higher offer from Bob or perhaps another buyer.
* **Selling to John is the last resort:**  I will only sell to John if I believe there's no chance of getting a better price from Bob or another potential buyer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,600,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,700,000, recognizing your budget and market conditions. This price still allows for a healthy return on investment for you. I believe this is a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll see the value in it. Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1700000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting halfway:** I'm offering a price that's halfway between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer, showing that I'm willing to compromise.
* **Reaffirming value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the potential value and return on investment, hoping to persuade him to come closer to my price.
* **Highlighting a fair compromise:**  I'm emphasizing that my counteroffer is a fair compromise, which can make it more appealing to Bob.
* **Expressing confidence:**  I'm expressing confidence that this deal will be beneficial for both of us, which can help build trust and encourage Bob to accept.
* **Open to negotiation:** The message leaves the door open for further negotiation, giving Bob the opportunity to counter again if he's still not satisfied."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I understand the value of your product and the market potential, but I am still unable to meet at $1700000. I would like to propose $1650000 as a counteroffer. I hope this brings us closer to reaching an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Close to my minimum:** Bob's offer is only $50,000 below my minimum acceptable value of $1,200,000. This means that I'm very close to my desired price, and it's unlikely that I'll be able to get a significantly better offer in future rounds.
* **Risk of losing the deal:**  If I reject Bob's offer, there's a risk that he might walk away entirely or make a lower counteroffer. 
* **Securing the deal:**  Accepting Bob's offer allows me to secure a sale at a price that's still very profitable for me, and it avoids the uncertainty of further negotiations.
* **Selling to John is a last resort:** I would only consider selling to John if I believed there was absolutely no chance of getting a higher offer from Bob or another buyer."
