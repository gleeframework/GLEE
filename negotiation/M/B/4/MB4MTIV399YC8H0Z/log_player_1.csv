Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I believe this product would be incredibly valuable for you, even more so than my minimum acceptable price.  I'm confident you'll see its worth. I'm offering it to you for $1,190,000. "", ""product_price"": 1190000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Knowing John will buy the product for $1,200,000 provides a safety net. Alice should aim to get as close to that as possible from Bob.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting with a price slightly below John's offer ($1,190,000) leaves room for potential counter-offers from Bob while still securing a significant profit.
* **Highlight Value:** The message emphasizes the product's value to Bob, potentially encouraging him to accept the high price even though it's more than his initial valuation.

This strategy aims to secure the highest possible price from Bob, leveraging the guaranteed sale to John as a fallback."
