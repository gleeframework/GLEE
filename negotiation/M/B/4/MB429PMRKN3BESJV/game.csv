"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is just a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,050,000? That's a fair price that gives you a great deal and allows me to make a reasonable profit. Let's make this happen!",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $950,000, but that's as high as I can go. Can we meet at this price?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $950,000 just doesn't work for me. I'm willing to go down to $1,000,000. That's a significant discount from my initial offer and a fair price considering the product's value.  Let's make this deal happen. ",1000000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,000,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $920,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",920000.0,Bob,6,
