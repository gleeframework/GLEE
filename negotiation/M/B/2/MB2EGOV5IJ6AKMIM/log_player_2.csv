"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $6,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $6,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's always worth trying to negotiate a lower price. Since you're willing to pay up to $8,000, there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 5500}
```

I'm offering $5,500 as a counteroffer. This is a significant discount from Alice's initial price, but still within my budget.  I'm hoping this will encourage Alice to negotiate further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice has moved a bit closer to my price, but there's still room for a better deal.  Rejecting allows me to continue negotiating and hopefully get closer to my target price of $5,500."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 5750}
``` 

I'm increasing my offer slightly to $5,750. This shows Alice I'm serious about buying, but still want to get a good price. I'm hoping she'll accept this counteroffer and we can close the deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $6,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $6,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $6,250 is a better price than Alice's first offer, it's still more than my target. I'm willing to keep negotiating and see if I can get closer to $5,750 before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 6000}
```

I'm increasing my offer again to $6,000. This is a compromise, as it's halfway between Alice's last offer and my previous counteroffer. Hopefully, this demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while still trying to get a price that's closer to my goal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $6,375. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $6,375
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While this is a slightly better price than Alice's previous offer, it's still above my target price of $6,000. I'm not willing to settle just yet and want to see if I can get her to come down further before potentially buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 6200}
```

I'm increasing my offer to $6,200. This is a small increase from my previous offer, and closer to Alice's last offer.  I'm hoping this shows I'm serious about closing the deal, but also that I'm willing to pay a fair price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $6,437.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $6,437.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

With only two rounds left, it's unlikely Alice will come down much further.  I've tried to negotiate and gotten close to my goal, but it's better to secure the product at a reasonable price from John than to risk getting stuck with a higher price or no deal at all."
