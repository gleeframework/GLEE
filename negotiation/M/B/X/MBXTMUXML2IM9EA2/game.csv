"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's worth a great deal to both of us, and I believe we can find a mutually beneficial price.  My initial offer is $1,750,000.  I'm confident this is a fair starting point, and I'm open to discussing further.  What do you think?",1750000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer.  However, that price is a little high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $1,200,000 for it. What do you think?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective.  While $1,200,000 is lower than I hoped, I'm willing to compromise.  Let's meet in the middle.  I'm prepared to offer you the product for $1,400,000. This represents a significant discount from my initial price, and it's still a great value for you.  What do you say?",1400000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $1,400,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something a bit lower.  Would you consider $1,300,000?",1300000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I hear you, and I'm trying to be flexible.  I'm willing to go a little lower, but $1,300,000 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference.  I'm offering the product for $1,350,000.  This is my final offer.  If it works for you, let's finalize the deal.  If not, I'll need to explore other options.",1350000.0,Alice,5,
