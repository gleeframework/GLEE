# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's worth a great deal to both of us, and I believe we can find a mutually beneficial price.  My initial offer is $1,750,000.  I'm confident this is a fair starting point, and I'm open to discussing further.  What do you think?

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective.  While $1,200,000 is lower than I hoped, I'm willing to compromise.  Let's meet in the middle.  I'm prepared to offer you the product for $1,400,000. This represents a significant discount from my initial price, and it's still a great value for you.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I hear you, and I'm trying to be flexible.  I'm willing to go a little lower, but $1,300,000 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference.  I'm offering the product for $1,350,000.  This is my final offer.  If it works for you, let's finalize the deal.  If not, I'll need to explore other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000

This seems like the best move. Alice is signaling this is her final offer, and while getting it lower would be ideal, $1,350,000 is still significantly less than John's $1,500,000 price."
