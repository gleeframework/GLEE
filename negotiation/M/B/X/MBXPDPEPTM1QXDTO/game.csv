"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $700,000 is below my desired price, I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $850,000? This price still allows me to make a profit while ensuring you get a great deal.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $850,000 is closer, but I need to be mindful of my budget.  Could we make it $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I understand your budget constraints, but $750,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $800,000, which is a fair price considering the value of the product.  This is my final offer, let me know what you think.",800000.0,Alice,5,
