"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,150,000. It's a valuable asset that's worth significantly more to you than to me. I believe this price is fair, considering your potential gains. Let's see if we can strike a deal!",1150000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,150,000 is a bit high for me.  Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $900,000 is significantly below my minimum.  Let's find a middle ground.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.  This price still leaves room for you to profit from the product while being fair to me.  What do you say?",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $1,050,000 is closer, but I need to be around $950,000 to make it work. Would you be willing to meet in the middle?",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $950,000 simply isn't enough for me to sell this product.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000, which is my absolute minimum. This price would still allow you to make a substantial profit. Let's see if we can reach an agreement on this final offer.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
