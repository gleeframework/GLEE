,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $65 is too low for me.  How about we split the difference at $85? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",85.0,Alice,3,

"I understand, Alice. It seems we both have some room to move here. How about we settle at $75? That's a fair compromise, don't you think?",75.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I think $75 is a good starting point.  Let's meet in the middle at $80. This gives us both a fair deal and allows me to avoid selling to John.",80.0,Alice,5,
