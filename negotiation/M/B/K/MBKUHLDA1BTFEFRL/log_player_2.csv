"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'll be very interested in. It's something that's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you at a price that's still very fair.  Would you be interested in paying $9500 for it? Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still above your maximum budget.**  You're willing to spend $10,000, and Alice is asking for $9,500.
* **You have a better alternative with John.**  While John's price is higher, it's still within your budget.  
* **Rejecting Alice's offer allows you to negotiate with her or potentially find another seller.**  You might be able to get John to lower his price if you let him know you have another offer.

Therefore, rejecting Alice's offer is the best strategic move in this situation."
