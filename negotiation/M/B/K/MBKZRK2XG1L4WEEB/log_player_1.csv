Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this item for sale at $150. I believe it offers excellent value at this price."",
""product_price"": 150
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally advisable to start negotiations above your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a higher profit.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Offering the product at $150 gives some space to come down if Bob makes a counteroffer, while still aiming for a price significantly above your minimum.
* **Confident Message:** The message is positive and emphasizes the value of the product without being overly aggressive."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above Minimum:** While Bob's offer of $120 is closer to your minimum, you still have room to negotiate and try to secure a higher price.
* **Negotiation Strategy:** Immediately accepting the first counteroffer could signal that you're willing to go much lower, potentially leaving money on the table. 

By rejecting Bob's offer, you signal that you're aiming for a higher price and open the door for further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Bob.  I appreciate your interest.  While I'm eager to make a deal, $120 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $135?"",
""product_price"": 135
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** By suggesting $135, you're demonstrating a willingness to compromise and find a price that works for both parties. 
* **Staying Above Target:** You're still negotiating above your minimum price ($100) and Bob's initial offer ($120), aiming for the best possible outcome.
* **Positive Tone:** The message remains friendly and solutions-oriented, encouraging Bob to continue the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not sure I can go as high as $135. How about we meet in the middle again, but this time at $130? I'm willing to pay a bit more, but I'm still trying to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Solid Profit:** Bob's offer of $130 is a significant profit margin ($30) above your minimum acceptable price.
* **Diminishing Returns:**  Continuing to negotiate risks Bob walking away or getting stuck in a prolonged back-and-forth with minimal increases.
* **Time Value:**  Securing a deal now means you can move on to other potential sales and opportunities. 

While you might be able to squeeze out a few more dollars, accepting $130 represents a favorable outcome in terms of both profit and efficiency."
