"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this amazing product for a one-time price of $20,000. It's a steal at twice the value it's worth to you! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $20,000 is far above Bob's maximum budget of $8,000.  It's in Bob's best interest to reject this offer and attempt to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're a savvy negotiator, Bob! I can see you're willing to walk away if you don't get a good deal. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to make a profit. I'll sell the product to you for $12,000. It's a fair price, considering the value it holds for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $12,000 is a significant decrease from her initial offer, it's still higher than Bob's maximum budget. Bob should continue to negotiate, aiming for a price closer to his target of $8,000."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're really interested in the product, Bob, and I appreciate your honesty. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I get a fair price. I'll sell the product to you for $10,500. It's a great deal for both of us, and I think you'll find it's worth every penny. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $10,500 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $8,000. While it's closer to his target, Bob should continue to negotiate, aiming to get a better deal.  Since he has the option to buy from John for $8,000, it makes sense to continue negotiating with Alice."
