{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $115. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's higher than Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation.  Since I have another buyer willing to pay $120, I'm not desperate to sell to Bob at a low price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of offering $110 for it. Would you be willing to consider that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $110 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $112? I'm confident you'll be happy with this price.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 112} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $108? I'm really interested in the product and don't want to walk away, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $108
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
``` 

While $108 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum price of $120. It's better to walk away and sell to John, who's willing to pay the price I want."
