"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $200 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay.  I'm interested in the product, but my budget is closer to $80. Would you be willing to come down to that price?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking to stay within your budget, but $80 is a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $160. Would you be willing to consider that price?",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $160 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm really interested in this product, but I'm sticking to my budget of $80.  Would you be willing to accept that?",80.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're really interested in the product, and I appreciate your enthusiasm. However, I need to make a profit, so I'm willing to compromise at $120. This is my final offer, and I'm confident you'll find it a great value.",120.0,Alice,5,
