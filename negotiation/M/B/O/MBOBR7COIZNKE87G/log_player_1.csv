"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product I think you'd be interested in.  I'm offering it to you for $100.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in buying the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. Can we meet at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Since my minimum value for the product is $80, I'll accept Bob's offer to avoid further negotiation and ensure a sale."
