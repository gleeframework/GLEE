"Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

You can likely get a better deal than $9,500. Since you're willing to pay up to $10,000, there's room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer will allow you to try and get a lower price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

I'm offering $9,000 for the product. This is a fair price that still allows Alice to make a profit, but it's also a significant discount from her initial offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Alice has come down to $9,200, which is within my acceptable range and still allows me to save money. Accepting the offer is the best choice at this point."
