"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its incredible potential and value, I believe a starting price of $1,300,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm aiming high to maximize potential profit, knowing Bob values the product significantly.  
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The $1,300,000 offer leaves space for Bob to negotiate down while staying well above my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Confident Tone:**  The message projects confidence in the product's value, which can influence Bob's perception."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,000,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price for the product, considering its value to me is capped at $1,500,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is significantly lower than my initial ask and still leaves a substantial amount of potential profit on the table.  I'm willing to negotiate, but I believe I can secure a better price by making a counteroffer. I'm not ready to sell to John yet, as there's still room for negotiation with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but I believe your offer undervalues the product's true worth. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,200,000 to find a mutually beneficial agreement."", 
""product_price"": 1200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Conciliatory but Firm:** I acknowledge Bob's offer but stand firm on the product's value. 
* **Strategic Concession:**  I'm reducing my price by $100,000, showing a willingness to negotiate but not drastically.
* **Targeting the Middle Ground:** I'm aiming for a price point closer to the middle of our current positions to encourage agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $1,050,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price, considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is moving closer to my range, a $1,050,000 sale still leaves a significant amount of potential profit on the table. I'm willing to push a bit further, especially with six rounds remaining.  I'm still not ready to accept his offer or sell to John for the guaranteed $800,000.  There's room for negotiation, and I'm confident I can secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, it seems we're getting closer. I appreciate you meeting me halfway. To bridge the remaining gap, I'm willing to accept $1,125,000. This reflects my desire to close this deal and recognizes the value you place on the product."", 
""product_price"": 1125000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Positive Momentum:** I acknowledge our progress and maintain a positive tone to encourage agreement.
* **Strategic Compromise:**  I'm splitting the difference between his last offer ($1,050,000) and my previous counteroffer ($1,200,000). 
* **Sense of Urgency:** While I haven't explicitly introduced a deadline, mentioning my desire to ""close the deal"" subtly implies time sensitivity."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm sticking with my previous offer. I believe $1,050,000 is a reasonable price for the product, considering its value to me. I'm willing to hold firm at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Diminishing Returns:**  Bob is signaling strong resistance to moving from his $1,050,000 offer. Further negotiation might yield minimal gains.
* **Time Value of Money:**  Prolonging the negotiation delays receiving payment. Accepting now provides immediate capital.
* **Opportunity Cost:**  While I could potentially squeeze out a bit more from Bob, there's a risk he walks away. Accepting secures a substantial profit.

While I could aim for a slightly higher price, Bob's firm stance suggests it's unlikely. Accepting the $1,050,000 offer represents a significant return and minimizes the risk of losing the sale altogether."
