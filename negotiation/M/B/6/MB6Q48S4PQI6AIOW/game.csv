"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $13,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $13,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. How about we meet in the middle at $11,500? I think that's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",11500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  $11,500 is closer, but still a bit higher than I'd like to go.  How about we settle at $10,750?",10750.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're trying to get the price as low as possible, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $10,750. I'm willing to compromise and meet you at $11,200. It's still a good deal for both of us, considering the product's value to you.",11200.0,Alice,5,
