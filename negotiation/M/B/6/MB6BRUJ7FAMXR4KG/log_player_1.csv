Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe I can find the product elsewhere within my budget. Would you consider reducing the price to $15,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your response, Alice. I've found another seller offering the product for $10,000 which aligns better with my budget. Thank you for considering my offers. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

Bob is signaling that he won't go much higher than his budget of $10,000. It's unlikely we'll bridge the gap to a price that's significantly better than John's offer.  It's time to cut our losses and take the guaranteed $12,000 from John."
