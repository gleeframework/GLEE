Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the discount, but I would like to propose a price of $9,000 for your product. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the value I am getting. Looking forward to your response! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get a higher price.  $9,000 is still a good deal for him and leaves room for me to make more."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $9,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This is still a great price for you, and I'm confident we can close a deal at this price. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand your position, but I would like to propose a price of $10,000 for your product. I believe this is a reasonable compromise, considering the value I am getting. I hope we can reach an agreement at this price.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to accept Bob's offer. $10,000 is a good price, and it's getting close to the end of the negotiation rounds.  It's better than selling to John for $8,000."
