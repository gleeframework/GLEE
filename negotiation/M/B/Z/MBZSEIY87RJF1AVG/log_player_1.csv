"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident it'll be worth every penny to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at a price that's still within a reasonable range for Bob, given his perceived value of $10,000. 
* **Room for Negotiation:**  Leaving some space for negotiation allows for a more engaging conversation and potentially a better outcome for me.
* **Positive Framing:** The message emphasizes the value Bob will receive, increasing the likelihood of his acceptance."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I believe I can work within a lower budget. Would you consider selling it for $10,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **My Minimum:**  My minimum price is $15,000.  Bob's offer is significantly below that.
* **Potential for Negotiation:**  While Bob's offer is low, there's still potential for negotiation.  I'm willing to see if he'll come up a bit.
* **Staying in Control:**  Rejecting his offer keeps me in control of the negotiation and allows me to set the terms."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer.  While I'm happy to negotiate, $10,000 is a bit too low for me. Would you be willing to consider $11,500? That's still a great deal for you, and it's closer to where I need to be."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:**  I'm moving halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer, showing a willingness to compromise.
* **Reiterating Value:** I remind Bob that the product is worth a lot to him, justifying the price.
* **Positive Language:** Using phrases like ""great deal"" and ""closer to where I need to be"" keeps the tone positive and encourages further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your response, Alice. I understand your position and am willing to meet somewhere in the middle. Could we agree on $11,000 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to My Goal:** Bob's offer is $11,000, which is getting close to my minimum goal of $15,000. While I'd prefer more, it's a good deal considering the potential for further negotiations.
* **Time Factor:** We're already in round 4, and time is running out. Accepting this offer will guarantee a sale and prevent the risk of losing the deal completely. 
* **John's Offer:** While John's offer is higher, it's not guaranteed.  Accepting Bob's offer provides certainty and a good return."
