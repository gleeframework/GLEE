Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you might be interested in. I'm offering it to you for $145. I think it's a fair price for the value it provides."", 
""product_price"": 145
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to earn as much as possible. Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $150, you want to see if Bob will pay more.
* **Negotiating Room:** Starting with $145 leaves room for potential negotiation with Bob if he counter-offers.  
* **Value Proposition:** The message subtly hints at the product's value, encouraging Bob to consider it even though the price is slightly above his perceived worth.

**Important Note:**  This is just one strategy. Depending on your knowledge of Bob (e.g., is he very price-sensitive?) and your risk tolerance, you might choose a different starting price."
