# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a fantastic deal considering its value to you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your maximum budget of $800,000. It makes sense to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price. You can likely get a better deal by counteroffering or going to John."
