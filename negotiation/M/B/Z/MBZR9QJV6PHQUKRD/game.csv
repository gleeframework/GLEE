"Alice, I appreciate the offer but $1,000,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price for both of us, allowing you to make a profit while still staying within my budget. Let's see if we can make this work.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $850,000 just isn't enough for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to make at least $950,000 on this. If you're serious about purchasing the product, this is my final offer. Let me know what you think.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $950,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $900,000, which is a fair price considering the value of the product for me and allows you a reasonable profit. This is my final offer. Let me know if you're willing to accept it.",900000.0,Bob,4,
