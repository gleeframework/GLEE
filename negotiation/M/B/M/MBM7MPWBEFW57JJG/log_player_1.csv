{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

This is a tough decision. Bob's offer is still below my minimum, and I'm running out of time. However, with only two rounds left, the risk of getting a lower price or even no deal at all is high.  Selling to John for $1,200,000 guarantees I'll get at least my minimum, even though it's not the ideal outcome."
