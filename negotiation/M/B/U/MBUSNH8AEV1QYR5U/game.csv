"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a deal. I'm willing to start with an offer of $11,000. What are your thoughts?",11000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but the price is a little high for me. Would you consider a lower price, around $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $9,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a price of $10,500. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. How about we settle at $9,750? I think that's a fair offer considering it's closer to the middle of our previous offers.",9750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, but I'm still not willing to go below $11,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,750 and $11,000. How about we settle at $10,375? This is a fair compromise, and I think it's a good opportunity for both of us to make a deal.",10375.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're really holding firm on this price! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,375 is still a bit steep for me. How about we split the difference between our last two offers and settle on $10,062? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",10062.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to budge from my minimum price of $11,000. However, I'm willing to make a small concession to try to find a mutually beneficial deal. How about we meet at $10,875? This is a slight discount from my initial offer, and I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product.",10875.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting close, but that price is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to bump up my offer to $10,468.  That's halfway between our last two proposals and shows I'm serious about getting this deal done.",10468.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued effort to find a deal. I'm willing to make one last concession to try to reach an agreement. However, I'm not willing to go below $11,000. How about we meet at $11,250? This is a slight increase from my previous offer, and I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product.",11250.0,Alice,9,
