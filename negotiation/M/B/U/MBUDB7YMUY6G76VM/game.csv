"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. I think it's a great deal, considering its value to you. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'd like to try to get a better deal.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $9,000 is still a bit low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $10,500?  I'm confident this product will be worth more than that to you in the long run.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $9,500, which is a bit above my initial offer, but I think it's a fair compromise. Can you meet me at this price?",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $9,500 is closer, I'm still not quite there. How about $10,000? It's a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away happy.  Let's close this deal!",10000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to walking away, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I can do $9,800, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. Can you meet me at this price?",9800.0,Bob,6,
