You should reject Alice's offer.  You can get the product for cheaper from John, and there's no reason to pay more than you have to."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still above your desired price.  You should reject and try to get closer to your goal.  You're still in a better position than Alice, since you have the option to buy from John."

This counteroffer is a small increase from your previous offer, showing Alice that you're willing to compromise but still value a good deal. It also leaves room for further negotiation, allowing you to potentially land on a price that's agreeable to both parties."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

Alice's offer is still too high.  You've gone through several rounds of negotiation, and it seems unlikely Alice will come down to a price you're willing to pay.  It's time to cut your losses and buy from John for a price you're comfortable with."
