"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $80 is below what I can accept, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $95?  This still gives you a good deal and allows me to get closer to my target price.",95.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still a bit far from my target, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $90? That's the lowest I'm willing to go.",90.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  I'm still a bit far from my ideal price, but I'm willing to meet you at $92.50.  This is a fair compromise for both of us.",92.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
I'm not sure I'm comfortable with $92.50. I was thinking more along the lines of $87.50. That's as low as I'm willing to go.,87.5,Bob,6,
