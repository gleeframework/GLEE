"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with it."", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $100, which is closer to my minimum acceptable price of $120. This gives me room to negotiate downwards if needed.
* **Positive framing:** The message is positive and emphasizes the value of the deal for Bob. This can help encourage acceptance.
* **Room for negotiation:** There's still room for Bob to counteroffer without me feeling like I'm giving away too much value.
* **John as backup:** Remember, I can always sell to John for $120 if I don't reach a deal with Bob. This provides me with leverage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $80 is below my minimum acceptable price of $120. Accepting this offer would be a significant loss for me.
* **Room for negotiation:** I can still counteroffer and potentially reach a compromise that benefits both of us.
* **John as leverage:**  The option to sell to John for $120 gives me confidence to reject Bob's offer.  This shows Bob that I'm not desperate to sell at his price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $80 is below what I can accept, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $95?  This still gives you a good deal and allows me to get closer to my target price."", ""product_price"": 95} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a compromise by lowering my price from $100 to $95. This shows good faith and willingness to negotiate.
* **Positive framing:**  The message emphasizes the deal still being good for Bob. 
* **Staying above minimum:** $95 is still above my minimum price of $120, so it's a reasonable counteroffer.
* **John as backup:**  Remember, I can still sell to John for $120 if negotiations fail, providing me with leverage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit far from my target, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $90? That's the lowest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:**  $90 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $120.  
* **Room for negotiation:** Bob has already indicated a willingness to go higher than $80. I can try to get closer to my target price with another counteroffer.
* **John as leverage:** I have the option to sell to John for $120, so I'm not pressured to accept Bob's offer just yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  I'm still a bit far from my ideal price, but I'm willing to meet you at $92.50.  This is a fair compromise for both of us."", ""product_price"": 92.5}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Compromise:** I'm offering a slightly higher price than Bob's last offer, showing that I'm willing to negotiate. 
* **Staying Above Minimum:** $92.50 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $120, allowing me to make a profit.
* **Midpoint Approach:** This price is a bit closer to Bob's offer, making it a more appealing compromise.
* **John as Leverage:** I still have the option to sell to John for $120, but I'm trying to close the deal with Bob first."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not sure I'm comfortable with $92.50. I was thinking more along the lines of $87.50. That's as low as I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $87.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Too close to minimum:** Bob's offer of $87.5 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $120. Accepting this would mean a very small profit margin.
* **Negotiation stalled:** It seems like we're at an impasse, with Bob refusing to go higher and me unwilling to go lower.
* **John's offer is better:** John is offering me $120 for the product, which is significantly better than Bob's offer. It's time to cut my losses and sell to John."
