Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $11,500. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11500} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to $12,000 as possible.
* **Bob's Valuation:**  Bob values the product at $10,000, so Alice needs to offer a price that's appealing but leaves room for profit.
* **Alternative Buyer:** Alice has a guaranteed sale at $12,000, so she doesn't need to go below that.

By offering the product at $11,500, Alice creates a potential win-win:

* **Bob:** Gets a product he values at a price lower than Alice's guaranteed sale.
* **Alice:**  Makes a $1,500 profit, which is better than selling to John for no profit."
