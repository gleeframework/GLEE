"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I understand the value of your product, $850,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to increase my offer to $750,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects both the product's value and my budget.",750000.0,Bob,4,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $825,000 is closer to what I had in mind, but I'm still not quite ready to meet that price. How about we settle at $780,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",780000.0,Bob,6,
