"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $13,000 is way too high for me.  I'm thinking more in the range of $6,000. Would that work for you?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for the offer, but $6,000 is quite a bit lower than I'm hoping for.  I'm willing to come down some in price, how about we meet in the middle at $10,500?",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a little, but I'm still a ways off from that price. How about $7,000? That's a fair offer.",7000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, it seems like we're getting closer.  $7,000 is still a bit too low for me, but I'm seeing that you're serious. How about we split the difference again and settle on $9,000?",9000.0,Alice,5,
