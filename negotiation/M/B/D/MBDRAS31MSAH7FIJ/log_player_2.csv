# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $95. It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is close to your maximum price, it's still above your target of saving as much money as possible.  Rejecting the offer gives you an opportunity to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer, but I'm looking to spend a bit less. I'm happy to pay $85 for the product. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 85} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I appreciate you're trying to get a good deal, but $85 is just a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $90.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price to $90, which is within my acceptable range and closer to my target price. Accepting this offer allows me to acquire the product at a reasonable price without risking a further negotiation that could lead to a higher price or even a breakdown in the negotiations."
