"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we discuss the price, I want to start with a competitive offer of $1,200,000. I'm open to negotiations, but I believe this is a fair starting point considering the product's value to you.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, I'm not quite ready to commit to $1,200,000 at this stage. I'm willing to consider a price closer to $1,000,000. This would still represent a significant investment for me, but it's a more comfortable starting point for our negotiations. Let me know your thoughts.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that the product's value to you is higher than $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer a price of $1,100,000. This is a fair compromise considering the product's worth to you. I'm open to further negotiations, but I'm not willing to go below this price.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. How about we split the difference and meet at $1,050,000? This would be a fair compromise that allows us both to save some money. What do you think?",1050000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your desire to split the difference, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable going below $1,100,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I'll offer you a price of $1,075,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to you. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm open to a deal.",1075000.0,Alice,5,
