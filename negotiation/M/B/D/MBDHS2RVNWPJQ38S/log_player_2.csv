"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we discuss the price, I want to start with a competitive offer of $1,200,000. I'm open to negotiations, but I believe this is a fair starting point considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly lower than the product's value to you, creating room for negotiation.  You can likely get a better price by counter-offering."

{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, I'm not quite ready to commit to $1,200,000 at this stage. I'm willing to consider a price closer to $1,000,000. This would still represent a significant investment for me, but it's a more comfortable starting point for our negotiations. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that the product's value to you is higher than $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer a price of $1,100,000. This is a fair compromise considering the product's worth to you. I'm open to further negotiations, but I'm not willing to go below this price.

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has moved closer to your desired price, $1,100,000 is still significantly higher than your initial counteroffer of $1,000,000. There is still room for negotiation, and you can likely get a better deal by making another counteroffer."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. How about we split the difference and meet at $1,050,000? This would be a fair compromise that allows us both to save some money. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your desire to split the difference, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable going below $1,100,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I'll offer you a price of $1,075,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to you. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm open to a deal.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $1,075,000, which is very close to your last counteroffer of $1,050,000.  This is a good deal for you, as it saves you a significant amount of money compared to buying from John.  Further negotiation might be possible, but the risk of Alice walking away or you losing the opportunity to buy from her outweighs the potential savings."
