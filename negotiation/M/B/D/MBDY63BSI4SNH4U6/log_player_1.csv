"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product, and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm offering it to you for $11,500. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price that's slightly above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Leaving room for counteroffer:** By starting at $11,500, I'm allowing for a potential counteroffer from Bob without immediately going below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.
* **Friendly approach:** I'm using a positive and encouraging tone in my message to build rapport and make Bob feel valued."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Would you be willing to consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $9,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  
* **More negotiation needed:** I'm willing to negotiate further to try to get a better price. 
* **Selling to John is an option:** If the negotiation with Bob doesn't work out, I can always sell to John for $12,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $9,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500, considering the value this product brings.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-offering higher than Bob's offer:** I'm still significantly higher than Bob's offer, showing I'm willing to negotiate but not desperate.
* **Leaving room for compromise:**  $10,500 is still above my minimum acceptable price, but it leaves some room for further negotiation if needed.
* **Highlighting the value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to emphasize that the price is justified."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but $10,500 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $9,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:** While it's closer to my acceptable price, $9,500 is still below my minimum of $12,000.
* **Negotiation potential remains:** I'm willing to keep negotiating, as Bob seems to be increasing his offer, suggesting there's room for further compromise.
* **John remains an option:** If negotiations with Bob ultimately fail, I can always sell to John for $12,000, ensuring I get my minimum price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up with your offer.  How about we split the difference and settle on $10,000?  That's a fair price considering the value this product brings. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:**  I'm proposing a price that's exactly halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer, showing a willingness to compromise.
* **Fair price argument:** I'm reinforcing the value proposition of the product to justify the price, reminding Bob that $10,000 is a fair deal.
* **Encouraging acceptance:** I'm using a question to encourage Bob to respond positively and move towards a deal."
