"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. I think that's a fair price considering the value I'll get from it. Would you be willing to consider my offer?",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your interest in the product, and I'm willing to consider your proposal. However, I have to say that $12000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $13500. This is still a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with the price.",13500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $13000, but I think that's as high as I can go. Would you be willing to consider my offer?",13000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm still a bit above my minimum price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $13250. This is the best I can do, and I think it's still a great deal for you.",13250.0,Alice,5,
