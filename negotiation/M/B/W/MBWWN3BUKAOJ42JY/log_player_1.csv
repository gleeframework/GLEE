Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll start by making an offer to Bob. Since the product is worth $800,000 to him, I'll try to get as close to that price as possible while still leaving some room for negotiation.

Here's my initial offer:

{""product_price"": $750,000}

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","Bob rejected my initial offer, and now he's making a counteroffer of $700,000. Since this is still below the product's value to him, I'll decide to reject his offer and try to get a better price.

I'll send a counteroffer to Bob:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
{""product_price"": $725,000}

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Bob rejected my initial offer, and I rejected his counteroffer of $700,000. Now, I'll send a new counteroffer to try to get closer to the product's value to him.

Here's my counteroffer:

{""product_price"": $735,000}

Let's see how Bob responds!"
