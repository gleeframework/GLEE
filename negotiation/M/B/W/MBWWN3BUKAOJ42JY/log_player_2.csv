"Alice's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than John's, there's still room for negotiation to potentially save more money. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 700000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to save as much money as possible.  A counteroffer of $700,000 is a significant discount from Alice's initial offer and still leaves room for negotiation.  This gives Alice a strong incentive to consider the offer while still allowing Bob to potentially get a better deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $735,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $735,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $735,000 is only $35,000 higher than Bob's last offer.  Considering that Bob can buy the product from John for $800,000, accepting this offer secures a good deal and saves $65,000 compared to buying from John. The risk of further negotiation is not worth the potential gain."
