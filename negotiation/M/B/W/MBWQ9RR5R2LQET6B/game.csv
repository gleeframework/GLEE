"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price, but I believe my initial offer is closer to the true value of this product.  How about we meet halfway? I'm willing to come down to $1,325,000.",1325000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit far off from $1,325,000. I'd be willing to go up to $1,300,000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. Can you meet me at that price?",1300000.0,Bob,4,
