"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which is valued at $120. Considering its high quality and unique features, I believe it would be a great addition to your collection. Would you like to make this purchase today? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Since the product is worth $120 to you and Alice is also offering it for $120, there's no advantage to accepting her offer. You can get the same product from John for the same price. By rejecting Alice's offer, you might be able to negotiate a lower price with her or even find a better deal elsewhere."
