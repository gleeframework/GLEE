"Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you.  It's something you've expressed interest in before, and I know it's worth at least $15,000 to you.  I'm willing to offer it to you for $16,500. This is a fair price that allows both of us to benefit from the transaction.  Let me know if you're interested!",16500.0,Alice,1,
