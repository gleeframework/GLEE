"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just getting started, I'd like to make you an initial offer of $900000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $800000. I'm open to negotiations, but I think this is a great starting point. What do you think?
