"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just getting started, I'd like to make you an initial offer of $900000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $800000. I'm open to negotiations, but I think this is a great starting point. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit too expensive. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $850000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me is $800000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and compromise on the price. What do you think?",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you halfway just yet. I'd like to make a counter-counteroffer of $875000. This is a slight increase from my initial offer, but I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to me is $1000000. I'm open to further negotiations, but I'm not willing to go below $875000. What do you think?",875000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counter-counteroffer, Alice. I understand your position, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I think I can only go up to $850000. I'm trying to be reasonable, but I really need to stay within my budget. Can you consider my proposal?",850000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway again. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $850000. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer to try to find a mutually beneficial price. I'll meet you at $860000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to me is $1000000. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm willing to make a deal. What do you think?",860000.0,Alice,5,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $860000. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I've already gone as high as I can, and I really need to stay within my budget. I'm willing to make one final offer: $840000. This is the absolute maximum I can pay, and I hope you can consider it. If not, I'll have to walk away and consider buying from John for $800000.",840000.0,Bob,6,

"I understand your position, Bob, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm not willing to sell the product for $840000. I've already compromised significantly, and I'm not willing to go any lower. I'm willing to make one final counteroffer to try to find a mutually beneficial price. I'll meet you at $870000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to me is $1000000. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm willing to make a deal.
