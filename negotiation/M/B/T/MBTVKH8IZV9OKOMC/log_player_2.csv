"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. This is a great deal considering its value to me. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. How about $5,000? That feels like a fair starting point."",
""product_price"": 5000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $5,000 is far too low. I understand you have a budget, but I'm confident this product will be a valuable asset for you. Let's meet in the middle. How about $9,000? That's still a great deal for you, and allows me to make a reasonable profit. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is coming down, but we're still not at a price I'd consider a ""great deal"".  There's room to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me. $9,000 is closer, but still a bit of a stretch. Would you be willing to do $7,000? That would work much better for me."",
""product_price"": 7000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you have a budget, and I'm happy to work with you. However, $7,000 is still quite low for this product.  How about we split the difference? $8,500. It's a fair price for both of us, and ensures you get a great deal on a valuable asset. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice is very close to a price I'd be happy with.  It's worth seeing if I can get her down those last few hundred dollars before settling."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, you're really close! I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers.  Would you consider $7,750?"",
""product_price"": 7750
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob,  I appreciate your willingness to compromise. $7,750 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle again? $8,125.  This price is fair for both of us, and allows me to make a reasonable profit.  Let's make this deal happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice is very unlikely to go below $8,000. It's time to cut my losses and go with John's guaranteed offer."
