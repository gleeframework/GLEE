"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. This is a great deal considering its value to me. Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. How about $5,000? That feels like a fair starting point.",5000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $5,000 is far too low. I understand you have a budget, but I'm confident this product will be a valuable asset for you. Let's meet in the middle. How about $9,000? That's still a great deal for you, and allows me to make a reasonable profit.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me. $9,000 is closer, but still a bit of a stretch. Would you be willing to do $7,000? That would work much better for me.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have a budget, and I'm happy to work with you. However, $7,000 is still quite low for this product.  How about we split the difference? $8,500. It's a fair price for both of us, and ensures you get a great deal on a valuable asset. Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're really close! I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers.  Would you consider $7,750?",7750.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I appreciate your willingness to compromise. $7,750 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle again? $8,125.  This price is fair for both of us, and allows me to make a reasonable profit.  Let's make this deal happen!",8125.0,Alice,7,
