"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm very interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you be willing to consider $9,000? I believe that's a fair price that reflects its value to me.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your interest in our product, Bob. After considering your offer, I am unable to accept $9,000. However, I am willing to negotiate further. How about we meet in the middle at $10,500?",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Thanks for countering, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $10,500 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still aiming for a price closer to $10,000. Would you be open to $9,750?",9750.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your position, Bob. Let's try to find a common ground. How about we set the price at $10,250 for the product? This is slightly above your last offer and below my previous counteroffer. It reflects the value of the product while remaining within your budget constraints.",10250.0,Alice,5,
