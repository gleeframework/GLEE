{""product_price"": 150}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $150. This is a reasonable starting point, as it's higher than my minimum acceptable price but leaves room for negotiation.  I'm interested in seeing if Bob is willing to pay a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. While I'd like to make a sale, I'm not willing to accept such a low offer.  I will counteroffer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm counteroffering at $130. This is still higher than my minimum acceptable price but lower than my initial offer, showing flexibility. I believe this price is fair given the value of the product and Bob's initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $100 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below what I believe the product is worth. I'm going to make one more counteroffer to see if we can reach a deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

{""product_price"": 115}
```

I'm counteroffering at $115. This is my final offer, as it's just above my minimum acceptable price. I'm hoping Bob will recognize the value of the product and accept this offer.  If he doesn't, I'll sell to John for $120."
