"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm asking for $130 for it. What do you think?",130.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hey Alice, thanks for the offer, but $130 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay.  I'm really interested in the product, but I can only go up to $85. What do you think?",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but $85 is just a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $107.50? That's still a good deal for you, and it gets us closer to a deal.",107.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I really want to make this work, but I'm still not quite there yet. Would you consider $95? That's a fair compromise and allows us both to get a good deal.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $95 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $100, which is a fair compromise. It's a great deal for you and allows me to get a decent price for the product. What do you think?",100.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $100 is still a little too high for me. I'm really pushing my budget here, but I'm willing to go up to $90. This would be a great deal for both of us, as it's a fair price for the product and allows me to stay within my budget. What do you think?",90.0,Bob,6,
