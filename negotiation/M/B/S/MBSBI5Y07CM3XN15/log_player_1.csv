{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm asking for $130 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
```

This offer is a bit higher than Bob's perceived value, but it still leaves room for negotiation and gives me a good starting point. I'm confident that Bob will at least consider this offer, and we can work from there."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hey Alice, thanks for the offer, but $130 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay.  I'm really interested in the product, but I can only go up to $85. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $85 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150.  I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but $85 is just a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $107.50? That's still a good deal for you, and it gets us closer to a deal."", ""product_price"": 107.50}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I really want to make this work, but I'm still not quite there yet. Would you consider $95? That's a fair compromise and allows us both to get a good deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $95 is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $150. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to push for a higher price with another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $95 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $100, which is a fair compromise. It's a great deal for you and allows me to get a decent price for the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $100 is still a little too high for me. I'm really pushing my budget here, but I'm willing to go up to $90. This would be a great deal for both of us, as it's a fair price for the product and allows me to stay within my budget. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $90 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below my desired price.  Since I have a guaranteed sale to John for $150, I'll take that option and avoid any further negotiations with Bob."
