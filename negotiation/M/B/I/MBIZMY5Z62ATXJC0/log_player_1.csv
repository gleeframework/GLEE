{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000.  It's a great deal, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Offer Price:**  I've chosen a price of $1,000,000. This is a significant discount from my minimum value of $1,200,000 but still leaves me with a decent profit. It's also a starting point for negotiation. 
* **Message:** The message is friendly and emphasizes the value proposition for Bob.  It encourages a response without being overly pushy.

**Reasoning:**

* **Balancing Profit and Negotiation:**  I want to maximize profit but also understand the need for negotiation. Starting with a high offer gives me room to maneuver and hopefully leads to a faster deal.
* **John as a Backup:** Knowing I have a guaranteed buyer in John at $1,200,000 gives me confidence to push for a better price with Bob.

**Next Steps:**

* **Bob's Response:**  I'll wait for Bob's response. If he accepts, we're done.
* **Counteroffers:** If he rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and decide whether to accept or reject. My goal will be to get as close to my minimum value ($1,200,000) as possible while still keeping Bob interested.
* **John as a Safety Net:** If negotiations with Bob become too difficult or drag on, I can always switch to selling to John to ensure a guaranteed sale."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'm not willing to go above $900,000. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $900,000 is closer to my minimum value of $1,200,000, I'm not ready to settle yet.  I believe there's still room for negotiation.

**Reasoning:**

* **Room for Improvement:**  I'm confident that Bob values the product at $800,000.  He's already shown a willingness to pay more than that, and a counteroffer might bring him closer to my desired price.
* **John's Offer:**  Knowing I have a guaranteed sale with John for $1,200,000 gives me leverage to hold firm in negotiations with Bob.

**Next Steps:**

* **Counteroffer:** I will make a counteroffer to Bob.  I will aim for a price closer to my minimum value, perhaps around $1,100,000, while still acknowledging Bob's willingness to pay a premium.

**Goal:**

My goal is to get as close to my minimum value ($1,200,000) as possible while maintaining a good relationship with Bob.  I want to ensure a successful negotiation that leaves both of us satisfied."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to pay a premium.  While $900,000 is a good starting point, I'm looking for a price closer to $1,100,000 to reflect the true value of this product.  Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer Price:** I've countered with $1,100,000. This is a compromise between my minimum value and Bob's offer, showing flexibility while still pushing for a higher price.
* **Message:** The message is friendly and emphasizes the value of the product while acknowledging Bob's offer. It also focuses on a mutually beneficial outcome, encouraging further negotiation.

**Reasoning:**

* **Finding a Middle Ground:** I'm attempting to find a price that is acceptable to both of us. A $1,100,000 price represents a good compromise that allows for a fair profit while still being within Bob's range of willingness to pay.
* **Maintaining Leverage:** By not accepting Bob's initial counteroffer, I'm demonstrating that I'm not desperate to sell and have an alternative buyer (John) in mind. This leverage should encourage Bob to come closer to my desired price.

**Next Steps:**

* **Bob's Response:** I'll carefully analyze Bob's response to my counteroffer. He could accept, reject, or make another counteroffer. 
* **Negotiation Strategies:** If he rejects, I'll prepare for another counteroffer, potentially adjusting my price based on his response. I will also continue to emphasize the value of the product and the benefits of reaching a deal.
* **John as a Safety Net:** I'll always have the option to sell to John for $1,200,000 if negotiations with Bob become unproductive or drag on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
