"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $9,000 is a good starting point, I'm looking for something closer to $10,500. This still represents a significant savings for you compared to the product's value to you.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $10,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so I'm offering $10,000 for the product. I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price.",10000.0,Bob,4,
