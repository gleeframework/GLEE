"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great product for a price of $13,000. I think it will be very beneficial for you and it's a great deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $13,000 is a good deal compared to John's price, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you're willing to negotiate, but $13,000 is a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'm willing to go up to $11,000 for this product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but the product is worth a lot to me, and $11,000 is cutting it a bit close to my bottom line. How about we meet in the middle at $12,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **$12,000 is a good price:**  It's significantly lower than John's price of $15,000 and still allows Bob to save money. 
* **Negotiation risk:** Continuing to negotiate might result in Alice refusing to lower her price further, forcing Bob to pay John's higher price. 
* **No guarantee of better deal:** There's no guarantee that Bob can get a better deal by continuing to negotiate.  Alice has shown a willingness to compromise, so accepting her offer is a safe and reasonable choice."
