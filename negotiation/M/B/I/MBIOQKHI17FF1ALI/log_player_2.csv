"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth more than $80 to us, but I'm willing to start our negotiation at $100. Let me know if this is within your budget or if you'd like to propose a counteroffer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $100 is a good price, there's still room for negotiation.  Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible, so rejecting the initial offer and counter-offering allows for more potential savings."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $100 is a good starting point, I'm looking to get this product for closer to $80. I'm confident this is still a fair price for both of us, and I'm happy to continue the discussion."", ""product_price"": 80}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and would like to propose a compromise. How about we set the price at $90? This is higher than your initial suggestion but lower than my starting offer, aiming to find a mutually beneficial solution. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming to save as much as possible. While $90 is better than Alice's initial offer, it's still higher than Bob's desired price of $80. Continuing the negotiation gives Bob a chance to potentially get closer to his target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $90 is closer to where I want to be, but I'm still hoping to land at $85. This is a fair price that reflects the value I place on the product and allows us both to walk away happy. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I'm glad we're finding common ground. Considering the value of the product and aiming for a win-win situation, how about we set the price at $87? This is slightly above your last proposal and below my previous offers, aiming for a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $87. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $87
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Target:** $87 is very close to Bob's desired price of $80, and only $2 more than his last counteroffer.
* **Potential for Further Negotiation:** While there's still room to try and negotiate down further, the risk of Alice rejecting a lower counteroffer and possibly raising her price again is high.
* **Time Pressure:**  With only 5 rounds remaining, accepting this offer is a good move to secure the product at a decent price, especially considering the alternative is buying from John for $120."
