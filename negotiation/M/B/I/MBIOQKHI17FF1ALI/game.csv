"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth more than $80 to us, but I'm willing to start our negotiation at $100. Let me know if this is within your budget or if you'd like to propose a counteroffer.",100.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $100 is a good starting point, I'm looking to get this product for closer to $80. I'm confident this is still a fair price for both of us, and I'm happy to continue the discussion.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and would like to propose a compromise. How about we set the price at $90? This is higher than your initial suggestion but lower than my starting offer, aiming to find a mutually beneficial solution.",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $90 is closer to where I want to be, but I'm still hoping to land at $85. This is a fair price that reflects the value I place on the product and allows us both to walk away happy. Let's see if we can find common ground.",85.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I'm glad we're finding common ground. Considering the value of the product and aiming for a win-win situation, how about we set the price at $87? This is slightly above your last proposal and below my previous offers, aiming for a fair compromise.",87.0,Alice,5,
