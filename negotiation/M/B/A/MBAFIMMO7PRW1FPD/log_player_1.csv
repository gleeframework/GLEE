Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you first. I think it's worth a lot, but I'm willing to let it go for $180. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 180}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations a bit higher than your minimum.  This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Justification:** By stating you think it's worth ""a lot,"" you're subtly anchoring the value in Bob's mind above $150. 
* **Direct Approach:**  While some might suggest being subtler, being direct can be disarming and efficient.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Personality:** If you knew Bob was very price-sensitive, you might start lower. This strategy assumes no prior knowledge.
* **Risk Tolerance:**  There's a small risk Bob will reject the offer outright. However, since you have John as a backup, you're guaranteed at least $150."
