"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you our premium product. I believe it's a game-changer and I think you'll really appreciate its value. With that said, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,000,000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal anywhere else. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm very interested in the product but $1,000,000 is a little too high for my budget. Would you consider a price closer to $650,000?",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $1,000,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm still confident that the product's value is worth more than $650,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $900,000. This is a fair price considering the product's worth to you, and I think it's a great opportunity for you to get a fantastic deal. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  $900,000 is still a little high for me.  How about $725,000?  That's a fair compromise between our two positions.",725000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $900,000 is still a bit above your budget, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $725,000. I'm willing to meet you at $850,000, which is a fair price considering the product's value to you. I think this is a reasonable compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it's worth the investment. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, thanks for working with me.  I can tell this product is valuable, and I want to make a deal.  My absolute highest I can go is $775,000.  If that works for you, we have an agreement.",775000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $775,000 is your absolute highest, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer, and that's $825,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great deal for you. If you're willing to meet me at this price, we can finalize the deal. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,7,
