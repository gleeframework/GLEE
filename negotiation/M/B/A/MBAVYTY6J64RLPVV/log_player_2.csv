Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $1,000,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm still confident that the product's value is worth more than $650,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $900,000. This is a fair price considering the product's worth to you, and I think it's a great opportunity for you to get a fantastic deal.

It's time to cut our losses and go with John. Alice is unlikely to go below $825,000, and we know we can get the product for $800,000 from John.  Saving the extra $25,000 makes more sense than continuing to negotiate with Alice."
