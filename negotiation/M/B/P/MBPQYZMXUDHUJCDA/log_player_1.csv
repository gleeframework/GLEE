Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its immense value to you, I believe a price of $925,000 is fair and reflects its potential. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 925000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a strong offer that's significantly below Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000) but well above my minimum ($800,000).
* **Room for Negotiation:** The offer leaves some room for negotiation if Bob decides to counter. 
* **Justification:**  By mentioning the ""immense value"" to Bob, I'm subtly reminding him why this is a good deal, even at a premium price. 

This strategy aims to maximize profit while still making the offer attractive enough for Bob to accept."
