"Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $100 is a good price, Bob can potentially get a better deal. By rejecting Alice's offer, Bob can try to negotiate a lower price. He has a strong bargaining position as he knows the product is worth $80 to Alice, and he has an alternative option to buy from John for $120."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is trying to split the difference between his maximum price ($120) and Alice's minimum price ($80). Offering $90 is a fair compromise that allows both parties to potentially benefit from the deal."
