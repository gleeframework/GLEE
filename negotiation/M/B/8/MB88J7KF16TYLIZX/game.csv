"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase my product. I believe it would be incredibly valuable to you. I'm asking for $18,000 to start negotiations. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree your product is valuable, $18,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $8,000.  What do you think?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,000 is significantly less than what I'm willing to accept. This product offers a lot of value, and I'm confident it's worth a significant investment. How about we meet in the middle at $14,000?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand your position, but $14,000 is still more than I'm comfortable spending.  How about we try $9,500? That feels like a fairer compromise to me.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me to find a fair price.  While $9,500 is closer to what I have in mind, I'm still looking for a bit more. Would you consider $12,000?  I'm confident this would be a great investment for you at that price.",12000.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, thanks for countering.  I'm getting closer to my limit, but I could do $10,500.  Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Bob,6,
