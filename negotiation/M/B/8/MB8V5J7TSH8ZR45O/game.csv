"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $20000. It's a fantastic deal and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer, but $20000 is significantly more than I'm willing to pay. I'm interested in the product, but I can only go up to $10000. Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget. However, $10000 is simply too low for me to consider. I'm willing to come down to $17000, which still leaves some room for negotiation. Let's see if we can find a compromise that works for both of us.",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $17000 is still above my budget. I'm happy to meet you in the middle at $13500.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",13500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $13500 is closer, it's still below what I can reasonably accept. Let's split the difference - I'm willing to go down to $15500.  This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us.",15500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm happy to see we're getting closer.  However, $15500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $14000.  Let's see if we can find a common ground.",14000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting very close.  I understand your budget constraints, but I can't go lower than $14500.  This is a fair price that allows for both of us to walk away satisfied. What do you say?",14500.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $14500 is still a bit more than I can comfortably pay.  I'm willing to go up to $14250.  This is my final offer - let's see if we can come to an agreement.",14250.0,Bob,8,
