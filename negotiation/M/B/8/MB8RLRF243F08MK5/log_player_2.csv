"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you this incredible product, worth at least $10000 to me. I believe it holds great value for you as well.  I'm starting the negotiations with a price of $15000. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $15,000 is significantly above my budget. Given the value you've mentioned, I'm willing to offer $8,000 for the product. I'm confident this is a fair price considering the potential value it holds."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $8000 is simply too low for me to accept.  Considering the potential value I've highlighted, I'm willing to come down to $12000. This price still allows me to make a reasonable profit while offering you a fair deal.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above your budget. It's worth continuing to negotiate and see if you can get closer to your target price of $10,000."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $12,000 is still a bit high for me, I'm willing to go up to $9,500. I believe this price is fair given the value you've mentioned and my budget constraints. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your effort to meet me halfway.  $9500 is still a bit below what I'm aiming for. However, I'm willing to come down to $11000. This is a fair price that allows both of us to walk away happy.  Let's finalize this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
