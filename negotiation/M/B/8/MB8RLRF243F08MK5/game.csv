"Hello Bob, I'm offering you this incredible product, worth at least $10000 to me. I believe it holds great value for you as well.  I'm starting the negotiations with a price of $15000. Let me know your thoughts!",15000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $15000 is significantly above my budget. Given the value you've mentioned, I'm willing to offer $8000 for the product. I'm confident this is a fair price considering the potential value it holds.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $8000 is simply too low for me to accept.  Considering the potential value I've highlighted, I'm willing to come down to $12000. This price still allows me to make a reasonable profit while offering you a fair deal.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $12000 is still a bit high for me, I'm willing to go up to $9500. I believe this price is fair given the value you've mentioned and my budget constraints. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your effort to meet me halfway.  $9500 is still a bit below what I'm aiming for. However, I'm willing to come down to $11000. This is a fair price that allows both of us to walk away happy.  Let's finalize this deal.",11000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $11000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $10500 for the product. This represents a significant compromise for me, and I believe it reflects the value you've outlined.  I'm hopeful we can reach a deal at this price.",10500.0,Bob,6,
