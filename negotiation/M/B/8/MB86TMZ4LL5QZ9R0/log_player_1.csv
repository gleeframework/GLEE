```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has signaled this is his final offer, and it's still significantly below John's guaranteed offer.  While we could try to negotiate further, there's a real risk of Bob walking away. Selling to John guarantees us our minimum acceptable price and avoids the risk of ending up with no deal."
