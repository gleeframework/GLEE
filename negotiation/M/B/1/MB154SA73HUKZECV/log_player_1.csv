"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1500000} 

This is a high opening offer, reflecting the value I place on the product. It allows room for negotiation while still positioning me for a strong profit. I'm also prepared to walk away if Bob doesn't meet my expectations, as I have a guaranteed fallback option with John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While it's closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable value. I'll counteroffer in the next round to try and bridge the gap further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000} 
```

This counteroffer shows flexibility while still maintaining a strong position. It's a compromise from my initial offer, but still significantly higher than Bob's offer. I'm hoping this will encourage him to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is very close to my desired price point.  While I'd love to push for even more, it's getting late in the negotiation and there's a risk of him walking away. Accepting this offer secures a strong profit and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation."
