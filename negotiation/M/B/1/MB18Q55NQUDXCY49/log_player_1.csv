Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $1200000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000

The product is worth $1,500,000 to me, and Bob is offering $1,200,000. While it's tempting, it's not worth the risk of settling for less, especially with John offering the full value. I will reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a better price in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer. While I appreciate your interest, $1,200,000 is significantly below my asking price. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to be closer to my initial offer.  Let's split the difference - I'll offer you the product for $1,500,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it to be a valuable investment."", ""product_price"": 1500000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

With only three rounds left and Bob's offers consistently below my desired minimum, it's becoming increasingly unlikely that we'll reach an agreement. I'm going to stop negotiating with Bob and sell the product to John for $1,500,000. While I wanted to get the highest possible price, it's not worth the risk of losing the sale altogether or settling for significantly less."
