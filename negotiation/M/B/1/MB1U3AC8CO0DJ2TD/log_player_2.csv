"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think you'll find it's a great opportunity for you. I'm willing to start the conversation with a price of $1100000. Is this something you'd like to consider? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While Alice's offer is lower than the product's worth to her, it's still above Bob's maximum budget. It's wise to reject the offer and attempt to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested, $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go. I'm prepared to offer $950,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive Counteroffer:** This counteroffer starts at a significantly lower price than Alice's initial offer. It signals Bob's intention to negotiate hard and push for a favorable price.
* **Justification:** The message provides a reason for the counteroffer, focusing on the price being ""a bit higher than I'd like to go."" This makes the counteroffer seem reasonable and less arbitrary.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message ends with a positive note, suggesting a willingness to find common ground. This keeps the negotiation open and encourages Alice to consider the offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not quite ready to go as low as $950000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my target. My new offer is $1025000. Let's see if we can find a sweet spot. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's Offer is Still Too High:**  While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still above Bob's budget of $1,000,000. 
* **Opportunity for Further Negotiation:** Bob should continue negotiating, as Alice has already shown a willingness to come down on her price. There's a good chance he can secure a better deal with further counteroffers. 
* **John's Offer:**  While John's offer is attractive, it's worth pushing for a better price from Alice first. If Bob fails to reach a satisfactory price with Alice, he can always buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price.  $1,025,000 is still a bit outside my comfort zone. I'm willing to go up to $975,000. This is a fair price that recognizes the value of the product while staying within my budget.  Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 975000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Increase:** Bob is raising his offer by $25,000, showing a willingness to compromise while still trying to get a better price. 
* **Appeal to Fairness:** The message emphasizes a ""fair price,"" suggesting that this offer is reasonable for both parties.
* **Urgency and Closure:**  The message ends with a call to ""close this deal,"" adding a sense of urgency and encouraging Alice to accept the offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle. However, I'm still a bit away from my target. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. My new offer is $1050000. Let's see if we can get to a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to John's Offer:** Alice's offer is very close to John's offer of $1,000,000.  The difference is only $50,000.
* **Risk of Further Negotiation:** There's a high risk that further negotiation with Alice will not result in a significantly better price for Bob. Alice has already demonstrated a strong desire to get closer to her minimum price, making further concessions unlikely.
* **Time Factor:**  With only 5 rounds left, it's getting risky to continue negotiating.  There's a chance that Bob might not be able to secure a lower price before the 10-round limit.

**Conclusion:**  It's in Bob's best interest to take the guaranteed deal with John at $1,000,000.  The potential savings from further negotiation with Alice are too small to justify the risk of not reaching an agreement or running out of rounds."
