"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1200000, which is a very competitive price considering its value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

Since you are willing to pay up to $1,200,000 for the product and John is offering it at that price, there is no reason to accept Alice's offer. Buying from John guarantees the product at your maximum price point."
