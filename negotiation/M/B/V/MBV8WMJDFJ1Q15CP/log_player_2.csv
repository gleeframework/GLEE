You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $950,000 is significantly higher than her own valuation of the product ($800,000). This suggests there's room for negotiation. 
* While buying from John for $1,200,000 is your absolute limit, there's a chance you can get Alice to lower her price closer to your ideal range.

By rejecting this initial offer, you signal to Alice that you're looking for a better deal. This opens the door for further negotiation and a potentially better price than $950,000."
