"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $8,200 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, how about $8,800? This is still a good price for you, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit. Let's try to reach an agreement.",8800.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit higher than $8,800. How about we meet in the middle at $8,500? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",8500.0,Bob,4,
