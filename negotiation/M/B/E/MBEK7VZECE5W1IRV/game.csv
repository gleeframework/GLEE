"I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900,000. I'm willing to pay that much, but I don't think it's worth more than that to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to be closer to $1,000,000 to make this worthwhile.  How about we meet in the middle at $950,000?",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $950,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $920,000, which is closer to my target price. Can you meet me at that price?",920000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $920,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to compromise further, but I can't go lower than $935,000.  That's a significant amount of money for me to leave on the table, but I'm genuinely trying to find a deal that works for both of us.  What do you think?",935000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, but $935,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $915,000, which is the highest I'm willing to go. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider buying from John for $800,000.",915000.0,Bob,6,
