"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not comfortable selling it to you for $75. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway between $75 and $90. I can offer it to you for $82.50. It's a fair price considering the product's value, and I think you'll be happy with the deal.",82.5,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. While $82.5 is an improvement, I still believe we could reach a more agreeable price. How about $80?",80.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $80 is a tempting offer, but I'm not willing to sell it to you for that price. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I can offer it to you for $85. It's the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great deal considering the product's value.",85.0,Alice,5,
