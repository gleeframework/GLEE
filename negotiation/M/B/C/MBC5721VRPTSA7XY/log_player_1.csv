Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000. This is a unique opportunity to acquire it before I offer it elsewhere."", 
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We know John offers a guaranteed $1,500,000.  Our goal is to see if Bob will pay more.
* **Strong Starting Point:** $1,350,000 is a significant markup from Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000) but still leaves room for negotiation if needed.
* **Sense of Urgency and Exclusivity:** Highlighting the product's value and mentioning other potential buyers encourages Bob to act quickly.

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer.  We can adjust our strategy based on Bob's response."
