"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of the product to you, but I believe we can reach a fairer price. How about $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down a bit to $10,500. This price is still fair considering the product's value to you. Let's see if we can find common ground.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Considering the product's value to me, I would like to propose $9,500 as a fair price.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but I'm still not comfortable with $9,500.  How about we split the difference and go with $10,000? It's a fair price for both of us, and we can finally close this deal.",10000.0,Alice,5,
