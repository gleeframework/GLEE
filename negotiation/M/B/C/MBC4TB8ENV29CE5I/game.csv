"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,500. Would you be willing to meet me halfway?",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $7,500 is just too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $8,250? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with this deal.",8250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $8,250 is still a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to go up to $7,800, but that's as high as I can go. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",7800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  I'm willing to come down to $8,000, but that's my final offer.  This product is worth a lot to you, and it's a fair price for both of us.  What do you say?",8000.0,Alice,5,
