"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,000.  It's a great deal, and I'm confident it will be worth every penny to you.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value, hoping to leave room for negotiation.  It's important to strike a balance between being aggressive and being reasonable to maximize the chances of a successful deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,500. Would you be willing to meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $8,000.  I'll counteroffer in the next round. I'm confident that I can secure a better price by continuing the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $7,500 is just too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $8,250? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with this deal."", ""product_price"": 8250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $8,250 is still a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to go up to $7,800, but that's as high as I can go. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still a bit too low.  I'll continue negotiating with Bob and aim for a price closer to $8,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  I'm willing to come down to $8,000, but that's my final offer.  This product is worth a lot to you, and it's a fair price for both of us.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 8000}
