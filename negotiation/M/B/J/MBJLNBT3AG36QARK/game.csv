"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its worth to you is $800,000. I believe we can find a mutually beneficial price. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, considering the product's worth to you is $1,000,000. What do you think?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but I can't go as low as $900,000.  How about we split the difference and settle on $1,050,000? This is still a significant deal for you considering the product's value to you. What do you say?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to go up to $950,000, but I think that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me in the middle and consider $975,000?",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $975,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,025,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you and its worth to me. Let's close this deal, I believe we're close to an agreement.",1025000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm getting close to walking away from the deal, Alice. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I can only go up to $1,012,500. This is my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me here, I'll have to consider other options.",1012500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,012,500 is still slightly below my target. Let's split the difference one last time. I'm willing to accept $1,018,750. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it represents a mutually beneficial outcome for both of us. This will be my final offer.",1018750.0,Alice,7,

"I'm really close to walking away from this deal, Alice. I'm willing to give you one last chance to meet me at $1,007,500. If you're not willing to accept this, I'll have to consider other options, including buying from John for $800,000.",1007500.0,Bob,8,
