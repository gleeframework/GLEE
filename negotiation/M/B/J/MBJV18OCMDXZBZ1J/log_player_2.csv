"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to acquire a unique product that I think you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,400,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000, and I'm confident you'll find it a great investment. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, you know you can get the product for $1,000,000 from John.  Buying from John saves you a significant amount of money ($400,000). There's no strategic advantage to accepting Alice's offer in this scenario."
