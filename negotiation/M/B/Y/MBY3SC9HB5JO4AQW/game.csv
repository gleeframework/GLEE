"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product, $15,000 is a bit too steep for me. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for it. Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was really hoping to get closer to my initial price. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to make a profit. I'm thinking of $13,500. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being flexible, but $13,500 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $12,500, which is a fair compromise.  If this isn't acceptable, I'll need to go with John's offer.",12500.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I've already compromised quite a bit from my initial offer. I'm willing to meet you at $13,000, but that's as low as I can go. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,5,
