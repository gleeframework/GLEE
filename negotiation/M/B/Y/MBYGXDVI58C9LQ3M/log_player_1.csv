Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. This is a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $800,000. I'm confident we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,000,000 is too high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $650,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $650,000 is better than nothing, it's far below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. I'll counteroffer Bob and try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $650,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to my target price. How about we settle on $900,000? This still gives you a good deal considering the value of the product to you."", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand this product has significant value, and I am serious about buying it.  To be realistic though, I need to stay within my budget. Would you consider $725,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $725,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

$725,000 is still significantly lower than my minimum. I'll counteroffer again, hoping to inch closer to my desired price."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. While $725,000 is still a bit too low, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $850,000? This offer reflects the value of the product while still giving you a good price."", ""product_price"": 850000}
