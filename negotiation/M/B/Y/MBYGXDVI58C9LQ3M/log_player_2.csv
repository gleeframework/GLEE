"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. This is a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $800,000. I'm confident we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is too high. We have room to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,000,000 is too high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $650,000?"",
""product_price"": 650000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  We're aiming to pay significantly less than our $800,000 maximum. Starting with a lower counter-offer gives us room to negotiate upwards.
* **Appearing Reasonable:**  While our counter-offer is a big jump down, we phrase it as ""meeting in the middle"" to suggest fairness.
* **Leaving Negotiation Space:** We don't want to lowball too drastically and risk offending Alice. This offer leaves room for her to counter."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $650,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to my target price. How about we settle on $900,000? This still gives you a good deal considering the value of the product to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is coming down, but we're still above our maximum budget. We need to show we're serious about a lower price.  We'll continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I understand this product has significant value, and I am serious about buying it.  To be realistic though, I need to stay within my budget. Would you consider $725,000?"",
""product_price"": 725000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Upward Movement:** We're moving closer to Alice's price to show we're willing to negotiate, but still well below her last offer.
* **Budget Focus:**  We're reiterating our budget limitations to signal that prices above this are unlikely to work.
* **Seeking Compromise:** By suggesting a specific number, we encourage Alice to counter-propose rather than just rejecting us outright."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. While $725,000 is still a bit too low, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $850,000? This offer reflects the value of the product while still giving you a good price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is unlikely to go much lower. She's now at $850,000, and we know we can get the product for $800,000 from John. Continuing to negotiate with Alice has a low chance of success and risks missing out on John's offer."
