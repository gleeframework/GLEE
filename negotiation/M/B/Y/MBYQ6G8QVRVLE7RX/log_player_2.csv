"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible product, and I think you'll really love it! I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal, considering its value to you is $15,000. I'm confident you won't find a better offer elsewhere. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $12,000 is tempting, you know you have the option to buy from John for $15,000. This means there's room for negotiation. By rejecting Alice's initial offer, you signal that you're looking for a better price and might be able to get her closer to her $10,000 valuation."
