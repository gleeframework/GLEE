"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. This is a great deal for you, as it's below its market value. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly lower than my minimum, hoping to incentivize Bob to accept. I also want to emphasize that this price is a good deal for him, which might make him more likely to agree."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $14,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $10,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. While I could accept his offer and get some profit, I'm confident that I can negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $10,000 is far below what I can accept. I'm willing to come down to $13,000, which still gives you a good deal.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

I'm still trying to stay above my minimum price, but I'm willing to compromise a bit to keep the negotiation going. I'm hoping that by showing flexibility and demonstrating that I'm open to compromise, I can convince Bob to increase his offer further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,500?  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $11,500 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. While it's getting closer, I'm not willing to sell it for that price. I'm confident that I can secure a better deal by continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to find a price that works for you, but $11,500 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $12,500. This is a fair price for both of us, considering the value of the product. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```

I'm getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, and I want to make it clear that this is my final offer.  I'm also emphasizing the fairness of the price, hoping that it will encourage Bob to accept."
