"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $14,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $10,000 is far below what I can accept. I'm willing to come down to $13,000, which still gives you a good deal.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,500? ",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to find a price that works for you, but $11,500 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $12,500. This is a fair price for both of us, considering the value of the product. Let's close this deal.",12500.0,Alice,5,
