I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,500,000. This is a higher price than I'm guaranteed to get from John, leaving room for negotiation and potential profit. 

**Reasoning:**

* **Potential for Higher Profit:**  A higher price means a bigger profit for me.
* **Risk Mitigation:**  While I want to maximize my profit, I'm also aware that Bob might not accept the offer.  Offering a price slightly above my guaranteed value allows for some flexibility in case Bob is willing to pay but not my full asking price. 
* **Negotiation:** This offer gives me room to negotiate if Bob counters with a lower price. 

Let's see if Bob is interested!"
