"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this exceptional product, which I believe you'll find truly valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Buying from Alice at $900,000 is better than buying from John at $1,000,000. 
* Even though Alice is selling the product for a higher price than it's worth to her, it's still a better deal for Bob than the alternative."
