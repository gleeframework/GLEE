"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe will be of significant value to you. It's worth at least $1,500,000 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for a price that's fair to both of us.  I'm asking for $1,400,000.  This is a substantial investment, but I'm confident you'll see a strong return on it.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is higher than her minimum value ($1,000,000) but it's still within my maximum budget ($1,500,000). This means there is room for negotiation. It's likely Alice will accept a counteroffer closer to her minimum value, allowing me to save some money."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking to get a good deal, and I appreciate your offer. However,  $1,200,000 is a bit too low for me to accept at this time.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to ensure I get a fair return on this product. How about $1,300,000? It's still a great price for the value you'll receive, and it gives us both some room to work with. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down from her initial offer of $1,400,000 to $1,300,000. This is a good compromise. While I can try to negotiate further, the risk is that she will either reject my counteroffer or revert to her initial offer. It's likely that I won't be able to get a price lower than $1,300,000 from her. Since this is still below my maximum budget and a better deal than buying from John, it's best to accept the offer."
