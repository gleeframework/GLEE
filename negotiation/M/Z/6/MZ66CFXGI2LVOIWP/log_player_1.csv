Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer. It's a good starting point, but I'm looking to spend a bit less. Given its value to me, I'm willing to pay $1,200,000.  This is still a substantial investment for me, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects the product's worth.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking to get a good deal, and I appreciate your offer. However,  $1,200,000 is a bit too low for me to accept at this time.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to ensure I get a fair return on this product. How about $1,300,000? It's still a great price for the value you'll receive, and it gives us both some room to work with."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
