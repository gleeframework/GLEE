"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth $120 to both of us. I'm willing to sell it to you for $110. Let me know if this works for you! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $110 is a good price, you're aiming to save as much as possible. Rejecting the offer allows you to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product but I'm only able to offer $100 at this time. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer starts the negotiation process by showing Alice you're serious about buying, but you're also trying to get a significant discount. Offering $100 represents a substantial drop from her initial price, making it clear you're willing to walk away if she doesn't come down."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your interest, Bob! I appreciate your offer. I'm willing to consider it, but I need to keep my options open. Would you be willing to increase your offer slightly? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved slightly closer to your price, but there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting her offer keeps the pressure on her to lower the price further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  However, I'm still only able to offer $102.  If that doesn't work for you, I might have to consider other options."", ""product_price"": 102}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer continues to push for a lower price while remaining within a reasonable range.  By offering a small increase from your previous offer, you demonstrate your willingness to compromise while still aiming for a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position and I'm glad we're able to negotiate. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $103. This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $103. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $103
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's final offer of $103 is within your desired price range.  Accepting the offer secures the product for a good price, saving you $17 compared to buying from John. While you might be able to negotiate further, the risk of losing the deal and having to buy from John for a higher price outweighs the potential savings of a few more dollars."
