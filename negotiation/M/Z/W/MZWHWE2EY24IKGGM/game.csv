"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I can sell the product to you for $9,500. What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $9,500 is still a bit high for me. How about we split the difference and go with $9,000? It's a fair price for both of us.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm not sure $9,000 is enough to justify the value of the product, Bob. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. I can do $9,250. It's a bit more than your last offer, but it's still a fair price considering the product's worth to you.",9250.0,Alice,5,
