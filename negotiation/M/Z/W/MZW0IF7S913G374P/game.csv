"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,800,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts?",1800000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. That price is a little high for me, I'd be willing to pay $800,000 for the product.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counter-offer. I understand your perspective, but $800,000 is significantly below what I can accept. This product holds substantial value for both of us. Would you be willing to consider $1,500,000?",1500000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  While I recognize the value, $1,500,000 is still a bit too steep.  Could we settle at $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're getting closer.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,250,000?  This would represent a fair deal for both of us, reflecting the true value of the product.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
