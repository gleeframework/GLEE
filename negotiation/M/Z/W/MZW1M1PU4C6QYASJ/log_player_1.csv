"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a unique product that I believe will be of great value to you.  I'm offering it to you for $15,000.  Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than my minimum ($10,000) to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm using a friendly and enthusiastic tone to build rapport and encourage Bob to engage. 
* **Value Proposition:**  I'm hinting at the product's potential value to Bob without revealing too much. This will make him more curious and potentially willing to pay more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of the product, but I am only willing to pay $12000 for it. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Below My Minimum:** While $12,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still below the value I've placed on the product.
* **Negotiation Potential:** There's still room for negotiation. I believe I can get closer to my desired price by making a counteroffer. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Selling to John for $10,000 is a guaranteed outcome, but it's a lower amount than I might be able to achieve through continued negotiation with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your interest.  While $12,000 is a good starting point, I'm still looking to get closer to my asking price. I'm willing to come down to $13,500. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:**  I'm meeting Bob halfway by reducing my price from $15,000 to $13,500.  This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate.
* **Continuing the Conversation:**  I'm keeping the conversation open and encouraging further negotiation. 
* **Stating My Value:**  I'm reminding Bob that my asking price is still higher than his offer, but that I'm open to compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Based on my budget, I would like to propose a price of $12500 for the product. I hope this meets in the middle for us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below My Minimum:**  While $12,500 is closer to my desired price, it's still below the $10,000 minimum I've set for myself.
* **Potential for Further Negotiation:**  We're now closer to a compromise, and I believe there's still room for Bob to come up a bit more. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Selling to John for $10,000 is a guaranteed outcome, but I'm still optimistic about reaching a more favorable price with Bob.  I'm willing to risk another round of negotiation to see if I can get closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued interest.  $12,500 is closer, but I'm still needing a bit more to make this work.  I'm willing to come down to $13,000.  This feels like a fair compromise for both of us."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Concession:** I'm making a small concession by reducing my price to $13,000, showing continued willingness to negotiate.
* **Highlighting Fairness:** I'm framing this as a ""fair compromise"" to appeal to Bob's sense of reason and potentially encourage him to meet me halfway.
* **Building Momentum:**  I'm keeping the negotiation moving forward by making a concrete counteroffer, and I'm using positive language to keep the conversation amicable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your efforts to reach a compromise. Based on my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price of $12750 for the product. I hope this proposal is acceptable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** While Bob has come up a bit, his offer of $12,750 is still below my minimum value of $10,000.  I'm not willing to sell for less than that.
* **Limited Time Remaining:**  We've reached Round 6, and time is running out. I need to make a decision soon.
* **Slight Optimism:** Even though we're close, I'm still hopeful that I can get Bob to agree to a price closer to my target through further negotiation. The risk of losing the deal to John is starting to feel more pressing. 

**However, it's important to consider that selling to John at $10,000 is becoming a more viable option. I'll need to be strategic in my next counteroffer and assess whether it's worth risking another round.**"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I appreciate your persistence in trying to reach an agreement.  $12,750 is getting closer, but I'm still needing a bit more to make this work. I'm willing to come down to $12,900.  This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's fair for both of us. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 12900}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** I'm clearly stating this is my final offer, putting pressure on Bob to make a decision.
* **Small Concession:** I'm making a small concession, but still staying above my minimum value.
* **Appealing to Fairness:** I'm framing it as a fair offer that benefits both parties.
* **High Stakes:**  With only a few rounds left, I'm emphasizing the potential risk of losing the deal to John. 

**It's a risky move, but I'm hoping the pressure and the small concession will be enough to convince Bob.**"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I've carefully considered our previous discussions and I would like to propose a final price of $12850 for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise considering my budget constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,850. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,850
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is Running Out:**  We are in Round 8, leaving only two rounds left. This situation is becoming too risky.
* **Below Minimum:**  While $12,850 is close, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.
* **Uncertainty with Bob:**  Bob's last offer indicates he is unwilling to go above $12,850, and there's no guarantee that another counteroffer will be successful.
* **Guaranteed Outcome:**  Selling to John for $10,000 guarantees a sale and meets my minimum requirement.  

**I am choosing to sell to John to ensure I don't lose out completely.  The risk of further negotiation with Bob is too high, especially with limited time remaining.**"
