"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $900,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget constraints.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $750,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $850,000.  This price reflects the product's true value and gives us both room to benefit from this deal. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence. $775,000 is a good offer, but I'm still a bit away from my target price. How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $812,500.  This would give us both a fair outcome, and I'm confident the product will be a valuable asset for you.",812500.0,Alice,5,
