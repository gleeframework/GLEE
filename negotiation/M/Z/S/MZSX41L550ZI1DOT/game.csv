"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand you're looking to get the product for a bit less, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,000,000.

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,025,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price.
