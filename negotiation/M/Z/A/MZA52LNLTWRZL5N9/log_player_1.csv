"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this fantastic product. I believe it holds significant value for someone with your business acumen.  To kick things off, I'm proposing a starting price of $2,000,000."", 
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Anchor:** Starting with a price significantly higher than both Bob's valuation and my minimum sets a strong anchor. This gives room for negotiation while ensuring any concessions still land within a profitable range. 
* **Positive Language:**  The message frames the product and the offer positively, emphasizing value and Bob's potential gain. This helps establish a collaborative rather than adversarial negotiation environment."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time and consideration, Alice. I'm very interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the market value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is better than his initial perceived value ($800,000) but still significantly below my minimum acceptable price. Rejecting his offer allows me to:

* **Continue Negotiation:** We're only in round 2. There's plenty of room for negotiation and potentially reaching a price closer to my target.
* **Gauge Flexibility:** By rejecting this offer, I signal that I'm serious about a higher price.  Bob's response will indicate his willingness to move closer to my range. 

It's too early to sell to John for $1,500,000 when there's potential to secure a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer and your understanding of the product's value.  However, my original pricing reflects the unique advantages this product brings, which go beyond typical market offerings. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,750,000."", 
""product_price"": 1750000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Concession with Justification:** I've made a significant concession from my initial offer, signaling flexibility. However, I've coupled it with a reminder of the product's unique value to justify the higher price point. 
* **Strategic Positioning:** This counteroffer is still comfortably above my minimum and closer to my starting point. It allows room for further negotiation while maintaining a strong position. 
* **Encouraging a Counter:** By not drastically dropping my price, I encourage Bob to continue the negotiation and reveal more about his willingness to pay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,750,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $1,400,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and the unique advantages you mentioned earlier. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,400,000 is now above my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. While I could potentially push for a slightly higher amount, the difference is not significant enough to risk losing the deal. 

Here's why accepting is the best strategy:

* **Profitable Deal:** $1,400,000 represents a substantial profit, even if it's slightly less than John's offer.  
* **Risk Mitigation:**  Continuing negotiations has diminishing returns.  Bob might be less flexible than anticipated, and pushing too hard could lead to him walking away.
* **Time Value:** Closing the deal now avoids potential delays associated with further rounds or selling to John. 
 
Overall, accepting Bob's offer secures a good outcome and avoids unnecessary risks at this stage."
