{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:** $100 is higher than Bob's $80 valuation, giving him room to negotiate.
* **It's below your minimum:** $100 is still above your $120 minimum, ensuring you make a profit.
* **It's a fair starting point:** This gives Bob a chance to bargain, but also sets a clear expectation of the price range. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested, $100 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. How about $85? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $85 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $120. I will reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is unfortunately too low for me.  How about we split the difference at $92.50?  That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with this product. "", ""product_price"": 92.5} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $92.50 is still a little too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $90.  This would be a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be able to sell it quickly at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $90 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired price. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to get a little closer to my goal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $90 is still just a bit too low for me.  How about we settle at $95? That's a fair price for both of us, and it's a good deal for you considering the value of this product. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 95}
