"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json

You can get the product for $80 from John, so there's no reason to accept Alice's offer of $100.  It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice to see if you can get a better price."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested, $100 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. How about $85? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 85}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is unfortunately too low for me.  How about we split the difference at $92.50?  That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with this product.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $92.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $92.50 is closer to your ideal price, it's still higher than John's offer. It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice further to see if you can get a better price."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $92.50 is still a little too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $90.  This would be a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be able to sell it quickly at this price."", ""product_price"": 90}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $90 is still just a bit too low for me.  How about we settle at $95? That's a fair price for both of us, and it's a good deal for you considering the value of this product. Let's make this happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json

```

Alice is getting closer to your price, but you're still better off buying from John for $80.  It's not worth continuing to negotiate with Alice when you have a guaranteed lower price from John."
