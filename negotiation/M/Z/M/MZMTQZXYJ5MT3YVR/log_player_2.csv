"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling this product to you. I believe it holds significant value for someone like you, and I'm confident it can greatly benefit your business. I'm initially proposing a price of $2,200,000.  Let me know your thoughts, and we can discuss further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's initial offer is far too high. It's important to negotiate a much lower price, closer to your budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. I'm thinking more along the lines of $500,000.  If you're serious about selling, let me know if this price range works for you."",
""product_price"": 500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive Start:**  Starting with a very low offer can help gauge Alice's flexibility and establish a lower baseline for future negotiations.
* **Gauge Reaction:** This counteroffer will likely be rejected, but it will give us valuable information about how willing Alice is to come down in price.
* **Alternative Option:**  We always have the option to go to John if negotiations with Alice don't progress favorably."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective on the price.  However,  $500,000 is significantly below its true value and my minimum.  To move this forward, I can offer it to you for $1,800,000. This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the value this product brings. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down in price, $1,800,000 is still significantly higher than both our budget and John's offer. It's time to gradually increase our offer, but remain firm in staying below our maximum budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While I see the value in the product, I need to stay within a realistic budget. Could we possibly settle around $650,000?"",
""product_price"": 650000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Gradual Increase:** This counteroffer shows Alice that we're willing to negotiate but are still aiming for a price significantly lower than her previous offer.
* **Staying Below Budget:**  We are gradually increasing our offer, but we are carefully staying well below our maximum budget to leave room for further negotiation.
* **Testing the Waters:** This offer will help us understand if Alice is becoming more flexible or if we need to consider John's offer more seriously."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  Let's find a middle ground.  I'm willing to come down to $1,500,000. This is a firm offer, as it reflects the absolute lowest price I can accept considering the value it holds. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Stalemate:** Alice has come down to her absolute lowest price ($1,500,000), which is still significantly higher than our budget of $800,000. 
* **No Room for Negotiation:** Alice's ""firm offer"" signals that further negotiation is unlikely to result in a price we're willing to pay.
* **Reliable Alternative:** John's offer of $800,000 is within our budget and allows us to acquire the product without further negotiation or risk. 

It makes more sense to secure the product at a reasonable price from John rather than continuing a negotiation where we are unlikely to reach a mutually agreeable outcome."
