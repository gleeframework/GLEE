"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. I'm thinking more along the lines of $500,000.  If you're serious about selling, let me know if this price range works for you.",500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective on the price.  However,  $500,000 is significantly below its true value and my minimum.  To move this forward, I can offer it to you for $1,800,000. This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the value this product brings.",1800000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While I see the value in the product, I need to stay within a realistic budget. Could we possibly settle around $650,000?",650000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  Let's find a middle ground.  I'm willing to come down to $1,500,000. This is a firm offer, as it reflects the absolute lowest price I can accept considering the value it holds.",1500000.0,Alice,5,
