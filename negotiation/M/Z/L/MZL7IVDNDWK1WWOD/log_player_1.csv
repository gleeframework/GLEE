Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1750000} 

I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, but leaving some room for negotiation. This strategy allows me to maximize my potential earnings while still keeping the door open for a deal with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is lower than my minimum acceptable price, and while it's closer to my desired range, I'm not ready to settle yet. I'll counter with a new offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

I'm counteroffering with a price of $1,600,000. This is still higher than Bob's offer, but lower than my initial offer, showing a willingness to negotiate. This is closer to my minimum price, but it still leaves room for further negotiation if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still lower than my minimum acceptable price. While I am willing to negotiate, I'm not willing to go that low, and the possibility of a further negotiation with Bob could lead to a lower price. 

Selling the product to John guarantees me my minimum acceptable price. This ensures I don't risk getting a lower price by continuing to negotiate with Bob."
