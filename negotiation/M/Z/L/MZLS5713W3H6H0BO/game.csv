"While I appreciate your offer, it's a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm ready to make a serious offer of $950,000 for the product. This represents a significant investment for me, and I believe it's a fair price considering the potential value of this product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $950,000 is a significant investment for you, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to the value I know this product has for you. I'm offering a counteroffer of $1,050,000. This is a compromise that I believe is fair, considering the value you've placed on the product. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1,050,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,000,000, which is a significant investment on my part. This price recognizes the value you've placed on the product while also reflecting my financial constraints. I'm hoping we can reach an agreement at this price.",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a price you're comfortable with. However, I'm not willing to sell at $1,000,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to the value I know this product has for you. I'm offering a counteroffer of $1,075,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value you've placed on the product. What do you think?",1075000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to keep negotiating. I'm getting close to where I need to be, but $1,062,500 is still a bit out of my reach.  I'm ready to make a final offer of $1,040,000.
