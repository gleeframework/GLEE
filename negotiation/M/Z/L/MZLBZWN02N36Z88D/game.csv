"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity to consider this product.  However, $1500000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $1000000 for it. Let's see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1000000 is a significant amount, but I'm not willing to go that low. Considering the product's value and rarity, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1300000. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's worth. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1300000 is still a bit high for me, but I'm willing to go up to $1150000. This is a fair price that reflects the value I see in the product while still staying within my budget. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a balance between the product's value and your budget. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $1150000. Considering the product's rarity and my initial offer, I'm willing to make a slight adjustment. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1250000. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's worth. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1250000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I'm glad we're close to reaching an agreement. However, I'm not willing to sell the product for $1200000. I believe the product's value is worth more than that. I'm willing to make one more adjustment to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1225000. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's worth. Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",1225000.0,Alice,7,
