Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm asking for $175 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $150 (John), you want to aim higher with Bob to maximize potential profit.
* **Reasonable Markup:**  A price of $175 represents a reasonable markup from your minimum acceptable price ($150) without being excessively high. This increases the chances of Bob accepting.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting slightly higher leaves room for potential negotiation if Bob tries to haggle the price down. 

This strategy aims to strike a balance between securing a profitable sale and avoiding a situation where Bob rejects the offer, leading you to sell at your minimum price to John."
