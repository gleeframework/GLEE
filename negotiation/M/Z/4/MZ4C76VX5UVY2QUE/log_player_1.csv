"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

I'm starting with a price of $100. This is a reasonable starting point, as it's higher than my minimum acceptable price of $80, but not so high that it's immediately off-putting to Bob. I'm hoping to gauge his interest and potentially start a negotiation from this point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $80 is my minimum acceptable price, I'm not yet ready to sell at that price. I'm hoping to get a better price through negotiation.  I'll see if I can get him to meet me somewhere in the middle in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
```

I'm counteroffering with a price of $90. This is a compromise from my initial offer of $100, but still higher than Bob's offer of $80.  I believe this price is fair, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it."
