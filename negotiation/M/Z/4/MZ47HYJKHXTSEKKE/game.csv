"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway again, Bob. However, I'm still not quite there yet. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1050000 was a bit too low for me, but $950000 is a bit too low for me as well. How about we meet at $1020000?

"I appreciate your flexibility, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $990000, but I'd like to make a slight adjustment to make it work for both of us. How about we meet at $1005000? I'm willing to give you a small discount from my previous offer, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product.",1005000.0,Alice,7,

"I'm not willing to go any higher than $990000, and I think that's already a generous offer. I'm starting to think that buying from John might be the better option for me. Can you reconsider your price?",990000.0,Bob,8,
