"I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. I can see you're a serious buyer, so I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll lower the price to $9000. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer

"Alice, I'm really close to pulling the trigger, but $8800 is still a bit too high for me. If we're both serious about this deal, let's meet in the middle at $8600. This feels like a fair price for both of us, and we can finally get this done.",8600.0,Bob,6,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $8700 is still a little out of my budget. To make this a win-win, how about we settle on $8650?  This would be a fair price for both of us, and we can finally finalize this transaction.",8650.0,Bob,8,
