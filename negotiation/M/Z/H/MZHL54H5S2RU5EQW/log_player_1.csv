"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a fantastic product that I think would be a great fit for your needs. I'm offering it to you for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $12,000, which is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm emphasizing the benefits of the product and framing the offer as a good deal.
* **Room for Negotiation:**  This price gives me room to negotiate downwards if Bob rejects the initial offer. 
* **Alternative Buyer:**  I'm keeping John in mind as a backup option, as he is willing to pay my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I really like the product, but I'm on a tight budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  $9,000 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable value of $15,000.
* **Negotiation Potential:**  While Bob's offer is low, it indicates his interest in the product. This gives me an opportunity to negotiate upwards.
* **Strategic Delay:**  Rejecting his offer allows me to see if he's willing to increase his price in future rounds.

I'm choosing to reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $9,000 is simply too low for me. The product is worth a lot more than that. However, I'm willing to be flexible.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,500? It's a fair price that gives us both a good deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer:** I'm rejecting Bob's offer, but I'm also showing flexibility by offering a counter-offer.
* **Middle Ground:**  $10,500 is a compromise, halfway between my previous offer of $12,000 and Bob's offer of $9,000.
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm framing the counter-offer as a fair price and a good deal for both of us.
* **Continued Negotiation:**  I'm keeping the negotiation open and giving Bob a chance to accept my counter-offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit above my budget, but I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer. How about $9,750? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** While Bob's offer is higher than before, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Room for Improvement:** I believe there's still room for negotiation. Bob has shown a willingness to increase his offer, indicating his strong interest. 
* **Strategic Delay:**  By rejecting his offer again, I can potentially push for a higher price in the next round.  

I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob, hoping to get closer to my target price. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $9,750 is a step in the right direction, but it's still not quite there for me. I'm willing to come down a little further.  How about $10,250? It's a fair price that would allow me to make this deal work. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10250} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Continuing Negotiation:** I'm staying engaged with Bob and showing a willingness to compromise.
* **Small Increment:**  I'm increasing my offer slightly from the previous round, signaling that I'm willing to meet him halfway. 
* **Fair Price:**  I'm framing $10,250 as a fair price that benefits both of us. 
* **Close to Target:** While it's still below my desired price, it's closer to my minimum acceptable value, increasing the likelihood of a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit away from my target, but I'm willing to compromise. How about $9,500? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** Bob's offer of $9,500 is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  
* **Negotiation is Stalling:** While Bob has shown some willingness to compromise, his offers have been consistently below my desired price. 
* **Time is Running Out:** We're nearing the halfway point of our 10 rounds, and I need to start considering the option of selling to John.

While I'm still open to negotiating with Bob, I'm starting to feel that we might not be able to reach an agreement that meets my minimum requirements.  I'm going to reject his offer and see if he's willing to make a more substantial increase in the next round. If not, I'll seriously consider selling to John."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $9,500 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm starting to think that we might not be able to come to an agreement.  I'm willing to make one final offer - $10,000.  This is my absolute bottom line.  If you're not able to meet me there, I'll need to consider selling to another buyer. "", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:**  I'm making it clear that this is my final offer and that I'm serious about selling to John if Bob doesn't accept.
* **Increased Pressure:**  I'm putting pressure on Bob by highlighting the limited time and my alternative buyer.
* **Compromise:**  While $10,000 is still below my ideal price, it's a significant compromise from my previous offer and a final attempt to reach a deal with Bob.

This is a risky move, but I believe it's necessary to push Bob towards a decision. If he still refuses, I'll be prepared to move on and sell to John."
