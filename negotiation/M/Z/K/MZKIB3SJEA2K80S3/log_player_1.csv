"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price that's closer to my desired value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Emphasis on mutual benefit:** I highlight that this price is a good deal for Bob as well, encouraging him to consider the offer. 
* **Open to negotiation:** I explicitly invite Bob to respond, showing flexibility. 
 
Let's see how Bob reacts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $900,000 is closer to my minimum desired value of $1,200,000, I'm not ready to sell at that price just yet. 

* **Room for negotiation:**  I believe I can get a higher price, especially with 8 rounds remaining.
* **Testing the waters:** I want to see how determined Bob is to buy the product and if he's willing to go higher. 

Let's see what counteroffer I can make in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but I'm still looking to get a little closer to my asking price. How about we meet in the middle at $950,000?  This leaves a comfortable margin for both of us."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Moving closer:** I'm demonstrating my willingness to compromise by moving closer to Bob's offer, but still aiming for a higher price.
* **Middle ground:** I frame my counteroffer as a ""meeting in the middle,"" making it seem more appealing and less aggressive.
* **Focusing on mutual benefit:** I reiterate that this price would be mutually beneficial,  emphasizing the potential win-win scenario.

Let's see if this counteroffer is more appealing to Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit far from your middle ground. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, which is $925,000. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $925,000 is closer to my desired value, I'm still holding out for a higher price.

* **Negotiation strategy:**  I want to see how far Bob is willing to go before I consider selling to John. 
* **Time is on my side:** With 6 rounds left, I have time to continue negotiating with Bob.

Let's see if I can get a better offer from Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see we're both willing to compromise.  Let's try $940,000. This is a small step closer to your offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value."", ""product_price"": 940000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Small steps:** I'm showing a willingness to compromise, but still trying to push for a better price. This small increment might seem more appealing to Bob than a larger jump.
* **Fairness emphasis:** I again emphasize fairness and value, reinforcing the idea that this price is reasonable for both parties.

Let's see if Bob is finally ready to close the deal!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to go up to $930,000. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $930,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $930,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

It's becoming clear that Bob is unlikely to reach my desired price point. With only 4 rounds left, the risk of not being able to get a better offer from Bob is high.  

* **Time constraint:** I'm running out of time to negotiate with Bob. 
* **Guaranteed profit:**  Selling to John guarantees a profit of $1,200,000, which is significantly higher than what I'm likely to get from Bob.

While I'd prefer to sell to Bob, maximizing my profit and ensuring a deal is my priority. Selling to John is the safest and most lucrative option at this point."
