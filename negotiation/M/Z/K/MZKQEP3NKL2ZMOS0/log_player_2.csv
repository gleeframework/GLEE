"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product at a special price. I think you'll really love it, and I'm confident it's worth every penny. I'm willing to let it go for $12,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

Alice's offer of $12,000 is a good deal. While you could try to haggle for a lower price, you risk losing the opportunity to buy it below your $15,000 maximum and would end up paying more by going to John."
