,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm very interested in the product, but $2000000 is out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $1200000 for it. Can you consider this offer?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1800000. It's a fair price considering the product's value and potential benefits. Let me know if this is more in line with your budget.",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but $1800000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1500000 for it. Can you consider this offer?",1500000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob. However, I still believe the product's value justifies a higher price. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1600000. This is my final offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement.",1600000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm starting to feel like we're getting a bit too far apart, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can do $1550000, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. This is my last offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement.",1550000.0,Alice,7,

"I appreciate your willingness to make concessions, but $1550000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1350000 for the product. Can you consider this offer?",1350000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to lose patience, Bob. I've already made several concessions, and I'm not willing to go any lower than $1500000. I'm willing to meet you at this price, but if you're not willing to meet me at this point, I'll have to consider other options. This is my final offer.",1500000.0,Alice,9,
