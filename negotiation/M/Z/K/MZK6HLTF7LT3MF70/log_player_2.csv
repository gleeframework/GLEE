"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950000.  It's a valuable piece, and I believe this price reflects its worth.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

It's better to reject the offer and make a counteroffer. You can save at least $150,000 by negotiating with Alice. Buying from John is an option, but you might be able to get a better deal by continuing to negotiate with Alice."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $850000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $900000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to move forward with the deal.  Let me know if you're interested.

While $900,000 is closer to your budget, you can still save more by rejecting the offer and making another counteroffer.  You're still $100,000 away from your goal."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $900,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $875,000?  It's a fair middle ground and gets us closer to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 875000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I truly appreciate your persistence in this negotiation. To make things clear,  $875000 is still a bit too low for me. However, I'm willing to make one final concession. How about we split the difference and settle on $887500? This would be a fair deal for both of us and would hopefully bring this negotiation to a close. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $887,500.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice's offer of $887,500 is the best you've received so far. While it's not your ideal price, it's still within your budget and allows you to secure the product. Rejecting and continuing to counteroffer might result in a lower price, but it's risky. You could end up losing the deal and being forced to buy from John at a higher price. Accepting Alice's offer is the most reasonable option in this situation."
