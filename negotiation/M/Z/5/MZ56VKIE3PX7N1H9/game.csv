"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $8,500?",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep for you, but $8,500 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $10,500. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $9,500 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to go up to $11,000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,5,
