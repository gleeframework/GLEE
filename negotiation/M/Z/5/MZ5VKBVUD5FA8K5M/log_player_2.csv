"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a unique opportunity to own something truly special. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value and rarity. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**  Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's offer of $9,000 is above Bob's maximum budget of $8,000.  It's best to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity. However, $9,000 is above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $7,500 for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 7500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive opening:**  Bob starts by making a lower offer, showing he's serious about getting a good deal.
* **Realistic target:**  $7,500 is significantly lower than Alice's offer but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Reasoning:**  Bob provides a reason for the lower price (budget), making the counteroffer feel less arbitrary."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. After considering your proposal, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $8250. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value and rarity. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:** 

* **Still above budget:** While Alice has lowered the price, $8,250 is still above Bob's $8,000 limit. 
* **Potential for further negotiation:** Alice has already shown a willingness to negotiate, so there's a chance she might go lower. 
* **Minimizing risk:** Rejecting this offer allows Bob to explore options without committing to a price higher than his budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $8,250 is closer, I'm still limited to my budget of $8,000. I'm happy to pay that amount, as I'm genuinely interested in the product.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 8000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final offer:** Bob presents his maximum budget clearly, leaving no room for further reductions on his side.
* **Highlighting interest:**  Emphasizing his genuine interest in the product might sway Alice.
* **Direct approach:** A direct and clear counteroffer leaves no room for misunderstanding."

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your budget constraints, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $8000. Considering the value and rarity of the product, I'm willing to meet you at $8200. This is my final offer, and I hope you'll consider it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small negotiation window:** Alice has only lowered the price by $50 from her previous offer.  There's little room for further negotiation.
* **Risk of losing the deal:**  Continuing to negotiate could lead to Alice becoming inflexible or simply walking away from the deal.
* **Secure alternative:**  Buying from John guarantees the product for Bob's maximum budget, providing a reliable option."
