"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think would be a great fit for you. It's worth $15,000 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. That's a significant saving for you, and it gives me a fair price for my product. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000.

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:**  While the product is worth $15,000 to Bob, Alice is offering it for $12,000. This is a significant saving compared to buying from John for $15,000. 
* **It's still a good deal for Bob:**  Even at $12,000, Bob is getting the product for less than its worth to him."
