"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I believe this product holds tremendous value for you, as it does for me.  I'm offering it to you at a price of $1,100,000.  I'm confident this is a fair price, considering its worth to you. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your maximum budget. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price before resorting to buying from John."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,100,000 is beyond my budget. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product, recognizing its value to both of us. This price allows for a fair deal and keeps the negotiation moving forward.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $900,000 doesn't quite meet my minimum requirement.  Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This price reflects the product's value while allowing for a mutually beneficial agreement.  I'm open to further discussion. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $950,000 is within your budget and represents a significant discount from her initial offer.  While you could try to negotiate further, it's likely Alice won't budge much lower, and you risk losing the deal altogether. Accepting her offer is the most sensible choice in this situation."
