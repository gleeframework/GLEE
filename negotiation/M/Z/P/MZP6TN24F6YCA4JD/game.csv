"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,100,000 is beyond my budget. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product, recognizing its value to both of us. This price allows for a fair deal and keeps the negotiation moving forward.  Let me know your thoughts.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $900,000 doesn't quite meet my minimum requirement.  Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This price reflects the product's value while allowing for a mutually beneficial agreement.  I'm open to further discussion.",950000.0,Alice,3,
