Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your initial offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,200,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a price of $600,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the market conditions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

I'm open to negotiation but need to see a price that reflects its true worth. How about we consider $1,000,000? This demonstrates my willingness to find a middle ground."",
