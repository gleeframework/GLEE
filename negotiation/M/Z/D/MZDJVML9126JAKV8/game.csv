"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I have to consider the value of the product to me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm going to counter with a price of $850000. Is this something you'd be willing to consider?",850000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I still think $750000 is a fair price for the product. I'm willing to compromise, but I'd like to get closer to my target. How about $780000?",780000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're trying to get closer to your target, Bob, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to make another concession, but I think $825000 is the lowest I can go. This is a fair price considering the product's value to me and the market. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand that you're trying to get as close as possible to your target, Bob, but I'm starting to feel like we're getting a bit too close to my minimum price. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving money on the table. I'll meet you at $810000, but that's as low as I can go. What do you think?",810000.0,Alice,7,

"I've made concessions, Bob, and I'm starting to feel like we're getting a bit too close to my minimum price. I'm not comfortable going any lower than $820000. I'm willing to meet you at this price, but I need to make sure I'm not losing money on the deal. What do you think?",820000.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to protect your profit margin, Alice, but I'm still trying to get as close as possible to my target. I'd like to make one final offer of $800000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I hope we can meet in the middle.",800000.0,Bob,10,
