Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $2,250,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth, but I'm open to discussing the price further if you have any questions or concerns."",
""product_price"": 2250000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, you have a strong position to aim high with Bob. 
* **Justification:** The message subtly emphasizes the ""value and potential"" to justify the high price without revealing your bottom line.
* **Openness to Negotiation:**  The phrase ""open to discussing"" leaves room for negotiation and makes you appear flexible, potentially leading to a higher final price.
* **50% Markup:**  The offered price of $2,250,000 represents a significant 50% markup from your minimum acceptable price. While this is ambitious, Bob's equal valuation of the product suggests there's room for a substantial profit. 

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes Bob is unaware of your guaranteed sale to John. If Bob knew your minimum price, this approach would be less effective."
