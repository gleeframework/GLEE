"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the item you're selling. However, my budget allows me to spend up to $10000 for this product. Would you be willing to consider a counteroffer at $12000?",12000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, $12000 is still a bit below my target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $14000. This is my final offer within this range, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere.",14000.0,Alice,3,
