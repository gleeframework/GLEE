"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1800000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,800,000.  This is a significant markup from my minimum value of $1,200,000, but it leaves room for negotiation.  My goal is to gauge Bob's interest and understand his potential budget."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $1,500,000 is a decent price, I'm still aiming for a higher return.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1700000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm lowering my offer to $1,700,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but it still leaves room for further negotiation. I'm hoping that Bob will see this as a reasonable price point and accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $1,600,000 is only $100,000 less than my initial offer.  I've already lowered my price twice, and I believe we're getting close to a final agreement.  Accepting this offer ensures a sale with a good profit margin, and it avoids the risk of further negotiation with Bob or potentially selling to John for a lower price."
