You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $1,000,000. It's always beneficial to negotiate and try to get a better price. There's a chance Alice might be willing to lower her price, especially since you have a backup option of buying from John for a much lower price."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $1,200,000 is closer to your budget, it's still over your ideal price point. It's worth continuing negotiations to see if you can drive the price down further.  You're already in a strong position since you can walk away and buy from John at a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $1,300,000 is still above your budget, and it's unclear if she'll go lower.  You've already reached your maximum acceptable price, and you have a guaranteed deal with John for $1,000,000.  It's time to take the safer option and buy from John."
