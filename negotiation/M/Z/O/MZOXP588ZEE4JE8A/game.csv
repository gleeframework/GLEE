"I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I'm not sure if the product is worth $1,200,000 to me. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it. Can you consider my offer?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective. While I value your interest, $900,000 is unfortunately below what this product is worth to me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This price reflects the significant value I know this product can bring to your operations. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your perspective, Alice, but I'm still not convinced that the product is worth $1,050,000 to me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $975,000. Can you consider my revised offer?",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $975,000 is still too low for me.  Considering the value this product brings, I'm willing to come down to $1,025,000. This is a significant concession, and I believe it reflects a fair compromise. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
