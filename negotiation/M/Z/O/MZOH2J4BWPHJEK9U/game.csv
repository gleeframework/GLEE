"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. This price reflects its high value and potential for your business. I'm confident this is a fair offer, but I'm open to discussion. What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $1,400,000 is a bit steep for me right now. Would you consider $1,100,000? I think that's a fair price that reflects the value it brings to my business.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position. However, $1,100,000 is significantly below the value I'm looking for.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This still leaves room for you to profit from the product, and it's closer to the value I'm seeking. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. While $1,300,000 is closer, it's still a bit of a stretch for my budget.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,200,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
