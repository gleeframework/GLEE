"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. This price reflects its high value and potential for your business. I'm confident this is a fair offer, but I'm open to discussion. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice's offer is closer to your maximum budget than John's, there's still room for negotiation. Starting at $1,400,000 leaves a significant potential savings on the table. By rejecting and countering, you aim to reach a more favorable price closer to Alice's valuation."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position. However, $1,100,000 is significantly below the value I'm looking for.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This still leaves room for you to profit from the product, and it's closer to the value I'm seeking. Let's find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000.

Alice is moving towards a more reasonable price, but there's still room for negotiation. While $1,300,000 is a significant improvement, accepting now leaves a potential $100,000+ in savings on the table (based on her $1,200,000 valuation). It's worth countering again to see if you can close the gap further before considering John's offer."
