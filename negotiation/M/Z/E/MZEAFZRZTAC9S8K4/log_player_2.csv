# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000. This is a great deal, considering its true value to you is $1,500,000. What do you think?

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,150,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's true value to you is $1,500,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,150,000 is a good compromise. It's still below your initial target price of $1,000,000 but within your maximum budget of $1,500,000. Further negotiation might save you a little more, but it's likely that Alice will not go much lower.  Accepting her offer now secures the product at a decent price."
