"Bob, I have a unique product that I think could be a great asset for you.  It's valued at $800000 to you, which means it has the potential to generate significant returns.  I'm willing to sell it to you for $1100000.  This price point gives you a healthy margin for profit, while still allowing me to get a fair price for my product.  Let me know your thoughts.",1100000.0,Alice,1,
