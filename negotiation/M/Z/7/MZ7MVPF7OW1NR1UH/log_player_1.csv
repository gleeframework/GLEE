Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a steal at $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value."", ""product_price"": 119}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to $120 as possible, as that's her guaranteed profit from John.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  While unlikely, starting at $119 leaves a tiny bit of wiggle room if Bob tries to counter-offer.
* **Create Urgency:** By stating it's a ""steal,"" Alice implies Bob might miss out if he doesn't act fast. 

**Important Note:**  There's no guarantee Bob will accept $119.  However, it's the highest price Alice can realistically offer while still having a chance to make more profit than selling to John."
