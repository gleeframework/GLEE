Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find very valuable. I believe it's worth $150 to you, and while I value it highly, I'm willing to part with it for $120. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  You want to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($150) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $120 allows for potential counter-offers from Bob while staying well above your minimum price.
* **Confident but Not Greedy:** The message implies the product's worth but shows flexibility, increasing the chance Bob will accept.

This strategy balances ambition with the risk of losing the sale to John."
