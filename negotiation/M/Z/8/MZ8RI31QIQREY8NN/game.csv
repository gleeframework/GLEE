"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your generosity. However, I am looking to keep my expenses within a certain budget. Would it be possible for us to negotiate the price down to $10,000? I believe this would be a fair compromise for both of us.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $10,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,500 to make this work. This price is still a great deal for you, considering the value of the product. What do you say?",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a price of $10,250 for the product. I believe this strikes a balance between your valuation and my budget constraints. I hope we can reach an agreement.",10250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $10,250 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10,375. This price is fair to both of us, and allows us to come to an agreement.  What do you think?",10375.0,Alice,5,
