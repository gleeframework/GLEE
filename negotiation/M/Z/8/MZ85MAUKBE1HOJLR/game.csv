,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $10,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $10,000 is a bit high for you, Bob. However, I have to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $9,500. What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $9,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $8,500. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",8500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're sticking to your offer of $8,500, Bob. However, I need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to go a bit lower, but I'm not willing to go all the way to $8,500. Let's try $9,000. It's a compromise, but it's still a fair price for both of us.",9000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate.  $9,000 is still a bit high for me.  Let's split the difference. How about $8,750? It's a fair compromise that allows us both to get a good deal.",8750.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to meet you halfway on the compromise, but I still need to make a profit. How about we try $9,250? It's a bit higher than your last offer, but I'm willing to see if we can meet in the middle.",9250.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to continue negotiating. While $9,250 is tempting, I'm still aiming for a price closer to my initial offer.  Let's try $8,875. It's a fair compromise that gets us closer to an agreement.  What do you think?",8875.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to feel like we're getting close, Bob! However, I still need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you at $9,000 again, but I'm not willing to go any lower. It's a fair price, and I think it's a good compromise.",9000.0,Alice,9,
