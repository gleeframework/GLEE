"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $110 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $95 for it. What do you think?",95.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $95 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference at $102.50?  It's a fair price for both of us.",102.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you want a fair price, but $102.5 is still a little too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $98. Let's meet in the middle.",98.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still not quite there at $98. How about we meet in the middle again at $100?  It's a fair price for both of us and we can close the deal.",100.0,Alice,5,
