Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this unique product and I believe it's worth a lot. I'm starting with an offer of $18,000.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 18000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $18000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $12000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's the minimum I'm willing to accept, I believe the product is worth more. I'll try to negotiate a higher price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but I need a bit more to make this work for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $15,000? This would be a fair price considering the value I'm placing on this unique product."", ""product_price"": 15000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $15000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $13500. Can you consider this revised offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While I'd love to get closer to my original asking price, Bob's offer of $13,500 is a good deal. It's more than John's offer and it ensures a sale without risking further negotiation."
