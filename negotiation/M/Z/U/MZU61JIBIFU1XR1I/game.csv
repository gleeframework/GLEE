"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested in the product, $12500 is a bit higher than my budget. Would you be willing to consider $8000? That's my maximum, but I'm confident it's a fair price.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $8000. I understand that it's a bit lower than my initial price, but I'm willing to negotiate. I'm thinking of a price of $10000, which is still a great deal considering the product's value. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $10000 is still a little too high for me.  I'm sticking to my offer of $8000. This product is valuable to me, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.",8000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're sticking to your offer of $8000, but I'm still not comfortable selling the product at that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $9500. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value. What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm really hoping we can reach an agreement closer to my budget. I'm going to stick with my offer of $8000.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",8000.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're still sticking to your offer of $8000, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer the product to you for $9000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,7,
