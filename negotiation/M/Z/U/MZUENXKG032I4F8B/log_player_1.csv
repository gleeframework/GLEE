Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value and the market conditions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,200,000 is significantly below its true value and my initial asking price.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, Alice, but $1,350,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,250,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the negotiations so far. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob is getting closer to a reasonable price, I'm still leaving a significant amount of money on the table if I accept $1,250,000. I'm willing to push a bit further to see if I can get closer to $1,300,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  To be frank, $1,250,000 is a bit too low for me to accept.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000, which I feel is a very competitive price. This represents a significant discount from my original offer and reflects my desire to reach a mutually beneficial agreement."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $1,275,000. I think this is a fair price considering the negotiations so far and the value the product will bring me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,275,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,275,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer to get $1,300,000, Bob is very consistently meeting me halfway.  It's unlikely he'll go much higher. Accepting $1,275,000 now is a good deal and avoids the risk of him dropping out of the negotiation later."
