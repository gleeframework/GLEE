"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 150}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $150. This is a good starting point because it leaves room for negotiation while still being higher than my minimum acceptable price. I'm curious to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. I'm not willing to sell it for that low. I will reject his offer and counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
```

I'm countering with my minimum acceptable price of $120. This is a fair offer considering the product's value to me and leaves no room for further negotiation. I'm hoping Bob will see the value in the product and accept my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer of $100 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still not enough.  I'm not willing to sell for less than my minimum value. I will reject his offer and counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 115}
```

I'm lowering my counteroffer to $115. This is a compromise, but I'm still holding firm on earning a profit above my minimum price. I'm hoping Bob will be willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer of $105 is getting closer, it's still not enough for me to accept. I'm not willing to sell for less than my minimum value. I will reject his offer and counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm lowering my counteroffer again to $110.  We're getting closer, and I'm hoping that this time, Bob will see the value and agree. I'm willing to be flexible to close the deal, but I can't go any lower than this."
