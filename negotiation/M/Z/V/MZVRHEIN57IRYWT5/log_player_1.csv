"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

I'm going to start by offering the product to Bob for $9,000. This is a fairly aggressive opening offer, but I believe there's room for negotiation. I'm confident that I can get at least $8,000, which is my minimum acceptable price, and I'm hoping to secure a higher price.  If Bob rejects, I'll be prepared to counter-offer and potentially work towards a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $8,000.  While I want to close the deal, I'm not willing to compromise on my value. I'll reject his offer and send a counter-offer in the next round, aiming for a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

I'm going to counter with $8,500. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still above my minimum acceptable price. I believe this is a fair price given the product's worth to Bob. I'm hoping this will be enough to convince him to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low, even though it's slightly higher than his previous offer. I'm going to reject his offer and continue negotiating.  At this point, I'm starting to consider the option of selling to John for $8,000. This would guarantee me a safe sale and prevent further negotiation with Bob. However, I'm still hoping to get a better price from Bob.  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 8200}
```

I'm going to lower my offer again to $8,200. I'm trying to meet Bob halfway, but I'm still not willing to go below $8,000.  I'm hoping that this offer is attractive enough for him to accept, but I'm also prepared to sell to John if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price.  While I'm still hoping to get a higher price from Bob, the negotiations are taking a long time and I'm starting to feel the pressure. I'm going to sell the product to John for $8,000 to avoid further negotiation with Bob and to guarantee a safe sale."
