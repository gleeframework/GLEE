"Alice, your initial offer is significantly higher than my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I can't justify paying that much.  I'm willing to offer $850,000, which is the maximum I can afford.  Let's see if we can find a way to make this work.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While I understand your position, the product's value is significantly higher than your initial offer.  I'm willing to come down to $1,750,000. I believe this price reflects the true worth of what's being offered.",1750000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you value the product highly, but $1,750,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000, which is a substantial increase from my previous offer.  It's the absolute maximum I can afford while remaining within my financial constraints.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
