"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $80. It's worth every penny, and I know you'll appreciate it.  Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $80
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Since you are willing to pay a maximum of $80 for the product, and Alice is offering it for $80, you are not saving any money by accepting her offer.  You can get the product for the same price from John. Therefore, rejecting Alice's offer makes sense in this situation."
