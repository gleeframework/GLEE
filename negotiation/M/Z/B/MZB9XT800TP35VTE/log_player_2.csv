"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is still significantly higher than my maximum price and what John offers. I should try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but that price is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $10,000?"",
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** I'm starting with a significantly lower offer ($10,000) than Alice's initial price ($14,000) to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Politeness:** It's important to remain polite and respectful throughout the negotiation process to maintain a positive relationship and increase the chances of reaching a deal.
* **Justification:** I've provided a brief reason for my counteroffer without revealing my absolute maximum price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest but $10,000 is too low for me. How about $12,500? I'm willing to be flexible to reach a deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down in price, but it's still above what John is offering.  There's room for further negotiation, and I'm aiming to get closer to $11,000 or even lower if possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. $12,500 is still a bit of a stretch for me. Could you do $11,000?"",
""product_price"": 11000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm moving closer to Alice's price, signaling that I'm willing to compromise.
* **Target Price:**  $11,000 is a good middle ground between my initial offer and her current price, offering a potential saving of $1,000 compared to John's price.
* **Continued Negotiation:**  I'm keeping the negotiation going to see if there's any flexibility on Alice's side."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to find a better price, but $11,000 is still significantly lower than what I need to accept. I'm willing to go down to $12,000. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice has matched John's price of $12,000. There's no point in continuing the negotiation as it's unlikely Alice will go any lower, and I can't get a better deal elsewhere."
