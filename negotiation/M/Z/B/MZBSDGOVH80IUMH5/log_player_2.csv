"Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $14,000 is a better deal than $15,000, Bob can still potentially get the product for a lower price.  Rejecting the offer allows him to try and negotiate a better price with Alice."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is $13,000.** This is still a better deal than buying from John for $10,000.
* **There's no guarantee Bob can negotiate a lower price.**  While he could try, it's risky. Alice has already rejected his counteroffer, indicating she's unwilling to go much lower. 
* **Accepting Alice's offer allows Bob to buy the product and save $2,000 compared to John's offer.** 

Therefore, accepting Alice's offer is the most logical decision to save money while ensuring Bob gets the product."
