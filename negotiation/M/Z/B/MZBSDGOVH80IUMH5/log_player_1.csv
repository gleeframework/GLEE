Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **My minimum:** I need at least $15,000 for this product.
* **Bob's value:** Bob values the product at $10,000.
* **Negotiation strategy:** I'm starting with a price that's slightly lower than my minimum, but still higher than Bob's value. This gives Bob some room to negotiate but also shows him that I'm serious about getting a good price. 
* **John's offer:** I have a backup option with John who is willing to pay my minimum. This gives me leverage in negotiations with Bob. 

By offering $14,000, I'm trying to find a middle ground that satisfies both my need for a good price and Bob's desire to get a good deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer:** Bob's offer of $12,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **My leverage:** I have a guaranteed sale with John at $15,000, so I have no reason to settle for less.
* **Potential for negotiation:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I can counter with a price closer to my target. This gives me the opportunity to potentially secure a better price without losing out entirely.

I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob, but I won't accept anything below my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **My minimum:** I need at least $15,000 for the product.
* **Bob's offer:** Bob offered $12,000, which is below my minimum.
* **Compromise:** I'm offering $13,000, which is a compromise between my minimum and Bob's offer. This shows that I'm willing to negotiate but also that I'm not desperate to sell.
* **John's offer:** I still have the option of selling to John for $15,000, giving me leverage.

By offering $13,000, I'm hoping to reach a middle ground that both Bob and I can agree on."
