Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. It's valued at $1,500,000 to me, but I'm willing to negotiate. My initial offer is $1,400,000.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at a price closer to my valuation to maximize my potential profit. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** I'm not starting at the full $1,500,000 because it's unlikely Bob will accept that right away. 
* **Communicating value:**  My message emphasizes the product's value to me, which might subtly encourage Bob to consider a higher price. 
* **Flexibility:** I'm leaving the door open for further negotiation if Bob doesn't accept this offer. 

This strategy allows me to gauge Bob's interest while still setting a price that would be profitable for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:**  $1,200,000 is below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. Accepting this offer would be a significant loss.
* **Potential for further negotiation:** While Bob is not willing to meet my initial price, it shows he is interested in the product. I believe there's still room for negotiation. 
* **John is a safe backup:**  Having John as an option gives me leverage in the negotiation. I can be more assertive in my counteroffer knowing I have a guaranteed sale if things don't work out with Bob. 

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can proceed to the next round and attempt to secure a higher price, while still keeping John as a secure option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your interest.  $1,200,000 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $1,300,000?  This would still allow me to make a fair profit, and I think it's a reasonable price considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bridging the gap:** My counteroffer is a compromise, moving closer to Bob's offer while still being significantly higher than his initial proposal. 
* **Emphasis on value:** I reiterate the product's value to justify my counteroffer.
* **Fairness and profit:** I emphasize that the proposed price is still fair while allowing me to make a profit. 
* **Open communication:** My message leaves the door open for further negotiation, showing flexibility and willingness to work with Bob. 

This counteroffer aims to strike a balance between maintaining my desired profit margin and finding a price that Bob might be willing to accept."
