"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**  $20,000 is far above Bob's maximum budget of $12,000.  It makes sense to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000} 
```

**Reasoning:**  Bob is starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's initial price. This is a strong opening move to gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate and see if she's willing to come down to a price closer to Bob's budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:** $18,000 is still above Bob's budget, and he has several rounds left to try and negotiate a lower price. It's worth continuing to push for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11500} 
```

**Reasoning:**  Bob is inching closer to his budget, but still leaving room for negotiation. He's demonstrating a willingness to compromise, but also setting a firm price point that is only slightly above his maximum."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**  While $17,000 is getting closer to Bob's budget, he still has some wiggle room and rounds left to negotiate. It's worth continuing to push for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000} 
```

**Reasoning:**  Bob is now pushing hard, offering a price that is within a few thousand dollars of his absolute maximum. This is a risky move, but it could either push Alice to accept or reveal her lower limit.  He's also showing Alice he is serious about buying the product, but needs a better deal.  If Alice rejects this, Bob may have to start seriously considering the offer from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**  While $16,500 is getting very close to Bob's budget, he still has a few rounds left to negotiate. It's worth trying one more time to get Alice to lower her price further. If Alice rejects this counteroffer, Bob will likely have to seriously consider buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000} 
```

**Reasoning:** This is Bob's last chance to get a good deal from Alice. He's increasing his offer slightly from the previous round, but still within his budget.  He's demonstrating a willingness to compromise, but also setting a firm price point that is only slightly above his maximum. This is a risky move, but if it fails, Bob will have to seriously consider buying from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:** Bob has only one round left.  He's already made a counteroffer that is extremely close to his maximum budget. There's a high probability Alice will continue to try and push for a higher price, and he's unlikely to get a better deal with her. Given that, it's time to cut his losses and buy from John for his maximum price of $12,000.  He's guaranteed to get the product within his budget."
