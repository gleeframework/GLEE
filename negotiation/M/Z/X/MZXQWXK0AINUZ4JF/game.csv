"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think that's the best I can do.",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $11,000 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little more, but I need to get at least $12,500 for the product.  Let's find a compromise that works for both of us.",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand that you're willing to come down, but $12,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'll offer $12,250. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial price.",12250.0,Bob,4,
