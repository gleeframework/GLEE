"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for $11,500. This is an exceptional opportunity to acquire a valuable asset worth $12,000 to you at a competitive price. I believe this offer presents a fair deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than buying from John, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to attempt a counteroffer and potentially get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer but I'm looking to spend a bit less.  I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product. This is still a fair price considering the value to me, and it gives you a good profit margin as well."", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and am willing to consider a compromise. In light of this, I would like to offer the product to you for $11,000. This price still allows for a reasonable profit while acknowledging your valuation of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is now closer to Bob's ideal price.** At $11,000, Bob is saving $1,000 compared to buying from John.
* **Further negotiation might not be worth the effort.**  The price difference is smaller, and continuing the negotiation might take more time and effort without guaranteeing a significantly better price.

While Bob could potentially try to push for a lower price, accepting Alice's offer ensures a good deal and avoids the risk of potentially losing the product to another buyer or ending up buying from John at a higher price."
