Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your continued interest, Bob. I appreciate your flexibility. In light of our discussions, I am willing to consider $10000 as a reasonable price for the product. This reflects a midpoint between our initial offers, aiming for a mutually beneficial solution. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice has moved closer to your desired price, and you're now only $500 away from your budget.  Accepting her offer is the best option as it's more likely that you'll be able to get a better price by continuing to negotiate, but it's also risky to keep rejecting offers and risk losing the deal entirely."
