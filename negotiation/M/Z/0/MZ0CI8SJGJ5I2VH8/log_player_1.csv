{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. This is a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:** $14,000 is higher than Bob's valuation of $12,000, giving him room to negotiate.
* **It's below your minimum:** $14,000 is below your minimum of $15,000, leaving you room to potentially negotiate further.
* **It's a good starting point:** This offer gives you a good starting point for negotiations and allows you to see if Bob is willing to pay closer to your desired price. 

Remember, this is just the first offer. You can adjust your strategy based on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $14000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $13000. Let's see if we can find a compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

``` 

While $13,000 is closer to your minimum, it's still below what you'd ideally like to get. Rejecting Bob's offer allows you to try for a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $13,000 is still a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference and I offer it to you for $13,500? This is a fair price that reflects both of our interests."", ""product_price"": 13500}
