"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1700000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $1,700,000. This leaves room for negotiation while still being significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price. I want to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to pay a premium."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. I'm not willing to sell for less than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I'll reject his offer and try to get closer to my target price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to $1,600,000. This shows Bob that I'm willing to negotiate but still maintain a profit margin. I believe this price is a reasonable compromise and might be acceptable to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low. I'm not willing to sell for less than $1,500,000, which is what John is offering. I'll reject his offer and see if I can get closer to my target price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1550000}
```

I'm offering Bob a price of $1,550,000. This is a significant step down from my previous offer but still represents a profit for me.  I'm hoping this shows Bob that I'm serious about making a deal, and he might be willing to meet me halfway."
