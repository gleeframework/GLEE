{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob has two good options here:

* **Accept Alice's offer:** This is a good deal, as the price is only $50,000 more than Bob's valuation of the product.
* **Buy from John:** This is the absolute best-case scenario, as it matches Bob's valuation exactly.

However, Bob is running out of time with only 5 rounds remaining. It's unlikely that he can get Alice to drop her offer significantly in the remaining time. So, it's better to accept Alice's offer and avoid the risk of running out of time and having to pay John's full price."
