"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $150 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet in the middle at $175? It's still a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with the product.",175.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to find a mutually beneficial price. However, I'm still not quite comfortable with $165.
