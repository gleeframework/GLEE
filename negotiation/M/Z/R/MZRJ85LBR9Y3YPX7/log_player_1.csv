Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$14,000:** This price is a good starting point. It's higher than Bob's perceived value, but it leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Message:** The message is friendly and emphasizes the value of the product. This helps to establish a positive rapport with Bob.

**Strategy:**

This offer aims to:

* **Maximize your earnings:**  By starting high, you leave room to negotiate down if necessary.
* **Gauge Bob's interest:**  His reaction will tell you how serious he is about buying the product. 
* **Maintain leverage:**  You can always walk away and sell to John, so you're not under pressure to accept a low offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $14,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  I'm interested in the product, but I can only offer $12,500.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is closer to your minimum, it's still below your target price. By rejecting his offer, you demonstrate that you're not willing to settle for a low price and that you value the product. This also allows you to explore further options:

* **Negotiate further with Bob:** You can counteroffer with a price closer to $14,000, giving him some room to increase his offer.
* **Consider John's offer:**  You have the option to sell to John for a higher price, but it's worth trying to see if you can get a better deal with Bob.

**Strategy:**

This approach aims to:

* **Maintain your leverage:** By not accepting Bob's offer, you show that you're not desperate and have other options.
* **Increase your potential earnings:** You might be able to secure a higher price through further negotiation with Bob.
* **Weigh the risks and rewards:**  Selling to John guarantees a certain amount, but there's a chance you could get a better deal with Bob."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $12,500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13,500.  That's a fair price, and I believe it's a great value for the product. Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$13,500:**  This price is a compromise, meeting halfway between your previous offer and Bob's. It shows you're willing to be flexible while still protecting your interests. 
* **Message:** The message reiterates your willingness to negotiate and highlights the value proposition of the product. It also keeps the tone positive and encourages further discussion.

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer aims to:

* **Show flexibility:**  Demonstrate that you're open to compromise, making Bob more likely to counteroffer again.
* **Keep the negotiation moving:** This keeps the momentum going and prevents the deal from stalling. 
* **Maintain your position:** By not dropping to Bob's initial offer, you signal that you're confident in the value of the product.

**Next Steps:**

Bob will either accept your counteroffer or make another counteroffer. Be prepared to analyze his response and make further adjustments to your price based on your desired outcome and Bob's willingness to negotiate."
