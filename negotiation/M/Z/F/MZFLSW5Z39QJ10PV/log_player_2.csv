"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product, which I believe has immense value. After careful consideration, I'm willing to sell it to you for $750,000. This is an unbeatable deal, considering the product's worth to you is $800,000. I'm confident you won't find a better offer anywhere else. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","I'll choose to reject Alice's offer. If I buy from Alice, I'll be paying $750,000, but I can get the same product from John for $800,000. That's a $50,000 difference, which is a significant saving. I'll reject Alice's offer and buy from John instead.
