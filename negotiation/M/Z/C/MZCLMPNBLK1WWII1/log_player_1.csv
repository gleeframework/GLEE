Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's in great condition and worth a lot to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than your minimum acceptable price:** This ensures you're still making a profit.
* **It's lower than Bob's perceived value:** This gives Bob room to negotiate and feel like he's getting a good deal.

By starting with this offer, you're setting the stage for a successful negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested but $14,000 is a bit steep for me.  How about $13,000?  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is above my minimum acceptable price, it's still below what I believe the product is worth. I'm going to try and get closer to my initial offer by making a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $13,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13,500. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 13500}
