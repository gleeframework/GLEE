Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $120. Let me know if you're interested!"", 
""product_price"": 120
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $80, you have room to negotiate higher with Bob.
* **Starting High:**  A higher initial offer gives you room to negotiate down if needed. 
* **Gauging Interest:** Bob's response to this offer will give you insight into how much he values the product and how much you can potentially get from him."
