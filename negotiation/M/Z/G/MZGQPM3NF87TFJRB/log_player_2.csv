# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $900,000 is lower than your maximum budget of $1,200,000 and higher than Alice's minimum acceptable price of $800,000. This means it's a win-win situation. You save $300,000 compared to buying from John, and Alice gets a better price than her minimum."
