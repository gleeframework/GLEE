"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to acquire a unique and valuable product. I believe it's worth a significant amount to you, and I'm willing to start the negotiation at a price of $2000000. Is this something you'd like to consider?",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product might be high to you, but I am looking for a more reasonable price. Would you be willing to consider $500000 for the product?",500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob, but I'm afraid $500000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'd like to counteroffer at $1250000. This is a significant concession, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value the product can bring to you.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I still feel that $1250000 is too high for me. I would like to propose $900000 as a compromise. I believe this price reflects the value of the product while staying within my budget.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're still a bit hesitant, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $900000. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to reach a price that's closer to my minimum value. I'd like to counteroffer at $1200000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a great deal for you.",1200000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm starting to think that we're getting close, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum value. I'd like to counteroffer at $1300000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a great deal for you. If we can meet in the middle, I'm happy to make a deal.",1300000.0,Alice,7,
