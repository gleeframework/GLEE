"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

I'm starting with a high price of $1,500,000. This is significantly higher than my minimum, but it gives me room to negotiate down if necessary. I want to see if Bob is seriously interested and willing to pay a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is far too low.  I'm not willing to sell for that price. I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $1,200,000. This is my minimum acceptable price and aligns with the offer I have from John. If Bob doesn't accept, I'll  move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000.

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum. While it's getting closer, I'm not willing to settle for less than $1,200,000. I'll reject his offer and counter again in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

I'm going to lower my counteroffer slightly to $1,100,000. I'm still above my minimum, but this shows Bob I'm willing to be flexible. It also gives me some room to negotiate further if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, but it's still not enough. I'm going to reject this offer and try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}

I'm going to counter with $1,050,000. This is a slight compromise, but it keeps me above my minimum. I'm hoping Bob will see that we're close and accept this offer."
