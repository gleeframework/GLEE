"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for you, considering the value it holds. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is way above your budget of $800,000.  It's worth trying to negotiate a better price before resorting to John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  This is a fair price, considering it's worth less to me than it is to you. Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 850000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial offer,  but still leaves room for negotiation. It's important to start with a strong counteroffer to show you're serious about getting a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer but I need to make a bit more to make this worthwhile for me.  How about $1,000,000? It's still a good deal for you, considering the value of the product.  Let's work together to find common ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to your desired price, it's still above your budget of $800,000. It's worth continuing to negotiate and see if you can get a lower price.  You have a good chance of getting closer to your desired price if you keep pushing."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $1,000,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $900,000.  This is a fair price considering our both our desired outcomes.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a compromise, showing that you are willing to negotiate but still sticking to your desired price range.  It's a reasonable increment that might entice Alice to accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you coming up in your offer.  $900,000 is a good start, but I'm still a bit short of where I need to be.  Let's meet in the middle at $950,000. This would allow us both to reach a satisfactory agreement.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $950,000 is very close to your budget, and you only have five rounds left. While you could continue negotiating, you risk Alice getting impatient and rejecting further offers.  Also, if you choose to buy from John, you'll have to pay $800,000, which is not a significantly better deal than Alice's current offer. It's best to accept this offer and secure the product."
