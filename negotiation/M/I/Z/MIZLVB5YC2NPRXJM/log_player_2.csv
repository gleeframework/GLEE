You are still trying to save money and can get the product for less than $110 from John, so rejecting Alice's offer and making a counteroffer is the best move."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob,  I understand you're trying to get the best price, and I appreciate that. This is my final offer: $112.  If you're not comfortable with that, I'll need to go with another buyer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $112. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $112

Alice's final offer is still above your target of $100. You have a guaranteed option to buy from John at a lower price, so it's best to take that option."
