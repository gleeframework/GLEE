Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

This is my initial offer to Bob. It's a starting point that's higher than my minimum but leaves room for negotiation.  I'm hoping he'll be willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'm also prepared to negotiate if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is my minimum, I'm going to reject it and see if I can get closer to my desired price. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
```

I'm going to counter with $13,500. This is still below my initial offer, but it's a significant step up from Bob's offer. I'm hoping this will show Bob that I'm willing to negotiate, but also that I'm not desperate to sell at his price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is only $500 less than my initial counteroffer and is closer to my desired price. I'd rather not risk losing the sale completely by continuing to negotiate. I'll accept his offer and secure the sale."
