"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. However, $8,500 is still a bit lower than my initial offer. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $9,500. This is the lowest price I'm comfortable with, considering the product's value to you.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can meet you at $9,250, which is still a great deal for you, considering the product's value to you. Let's see if we can finalize the deal at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,250

At this point, Alice has come down considerably and is unlikely to go much lower. Accepting at $9,250 secures a good price for you while avoiding the risk of her retracting the offer or you having to settle for John's $12,000 price."
