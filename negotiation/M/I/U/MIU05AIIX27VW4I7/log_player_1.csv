Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a little too high for me.  Would you consider $700,000?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $700,000 is significantly below its value. I could consider coming down to $900,000. This is my final offer."", ""product_price"": 900000}"

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the product holds value but $900,000 is still a bit too steep for me. How about we meet in the middle at $800,000?

While I could try to push for more, Bob offering $800,000 meets my minimum acceptable price. It's better to secure a deal now than risk him walking away and potentially getting the same amount from John."
