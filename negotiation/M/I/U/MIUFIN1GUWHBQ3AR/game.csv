"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1500000. I'm interested in the product, but I have a limited budget, and I'm not sure I can go any higher than that.",1500000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're working with a limited budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1500000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll counteroffer at $1750000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a great value for this unique product. What do you think?",1750000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1200000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value, and I'm willing to walk away if you're not willing to meet me at this price.",1200000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to make a counteroffer. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $1200000. I'm willing to make a small concession, but I need to make sure I get a good value for this product. I'll counteroffer at $1325000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",1325000.0,Alice,5,
