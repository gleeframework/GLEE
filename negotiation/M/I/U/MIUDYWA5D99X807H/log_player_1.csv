Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a fantastic product I think you'll be interested in. I'm asking $15,000 for it.  It's a great deal and I'm confident you'll see the value in it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 15000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $12,000 is my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price if I continue negotiating. I'm going to counter with a price closer to my initial offer, but still below the $15,000 I initially wanted."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. I understand your offer of $12,000, but I'm still hoping for a price closer to my initial offer. How about we meet in the middle at $13,500?  This price still offers a great value, and I'm confident you won't be disappointed. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to go up to $13000, but I think that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at $13000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I would prefer a higher price,  $13,000 is a good deal and closer to my initial offer.  I don't want to risk losing the deal by continuing to negotiate, especially since John is also willing to buy the product for $12,000."
