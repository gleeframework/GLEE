,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the product, $1,000,000 is above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850,000, which is still a significant amount for me and allows for a fair profit for you.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to sell the product for $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell it to you for $950,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and my original asking price.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're motivated to sell, but $950,000 is still a stretch for me. I'm confident we can find a middle ground. I'm willing to go to $900,000, which reflects the value I see in the product and allows for a healthy profit for you.  Let's bridge the gap and finalize this deal.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000. I'm willing to compromise and sell the product to you for $925,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to me and the market demand.",925000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $925,000 is still outside my comfort zone.  I'm confident we can find a solution that benefits us both. I'm willing to offer $875,000 for the product. This price reflects the value I see in it and leaves room for you to make a profit. Let's reach a final agreement.",875000.0,Bob,6,
