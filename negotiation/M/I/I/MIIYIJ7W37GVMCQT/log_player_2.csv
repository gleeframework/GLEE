"Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

``` 

You should reject Alice's offer. It's too high, and you can get the product for less from John or potentially negotiate a better price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000} 
``` 
I'm going to start by offering Alice $12,000. This is significantly lower than her asking price but still a good starting point for negotiation.  I'm hoping we can find a middle ground."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer of $16,000 is still above my ideal price, but it's a good compromise. I don't want to risk further negotiation and potentially lose the product to another buyer.  $16,000 is still within my budget, and I'm confident I can get a good deal."
