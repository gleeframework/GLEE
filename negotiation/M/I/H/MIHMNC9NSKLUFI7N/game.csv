"Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $1,750,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $1,200,000.  Let me know what you think.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get at least $1,600,000 for the product.  Let's meet in the middle.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you're looking for a fair price. How about we settle at $1,400,000? That's a significant increase from my previous offer and a reasonable compromise.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
