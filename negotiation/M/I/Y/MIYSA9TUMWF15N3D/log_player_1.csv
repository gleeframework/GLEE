Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm offering the product to Bob for $11,500. This is a price that is higher than what the product is worth to him, but lower than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. This allows for some room for negotiation if Bob rejects the offer. 

By starting at a slightly higher price, I hope to maximize my profit while still keeping the negotiation open.  If Bob rejects this offer, I will be prepared to counter-offer or accept his counteroffer, considering the value of continuing the negotiation with Bob versus selling to John for $12,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is higher than what the product is worth to him, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  I'm willing to negotiate further, hoping to secure a price closer to my desired range.  Since John is willing to pay $12,000, I don't want to sell to Bob at this price. I will counter-offer to try and get closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm counter-offering Bob at $11,000. This is still higher than what the product is worth to him, but lower than my original offer and closer to his offer. This shows that I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm also firm on my minimum acceptable price. This strategy aims to find a middle ground and hopefully reach a deal that benefits both of us."
