Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a unique product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its worth, I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000. I'm confident this is a fair reflection of its value, and I'm open to discussing it further if you have any questions."",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $1,000,000 (John), you can afford to start with a higher offer to Bob. 
* **Testing the Waters:** A price of $1,500,000 allows you to gauge Bob's interest and flexibility. 
* **Room for Negotiation:**  The message leaves room for negotiation, implying you might be willing to lower the price slightly.

This strategy aims to maximize your potential profit while still securing a sale. If Bob rejects the offer, you haven't lost anything, as you can sell it to John at your minimum desired price."
