Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $90 is better than nothing, I'm hoping to get closer to my desired price. I'll see if I can negotiate a bit higher in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget concerns.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $105. This is still a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll be happy with the product.  Let's see if we can make this work!"", ""product_price"": 105}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $95? I'm really interested in the product, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let me know what you think! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting to sell for $95, I'm still hoping to get closer to my desired price of $100. John is a reliable buyer and will pay that amount without any negotiation.  I'll see if I can convince Bob to go a little higher in the next round, but I'm prepared to walk away and sell to John if necessary."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence and I'm happy to continue negotiating.  I'm willing to come down to $100.  This is my bottom line, but I believe it's still a fair price for both of us. Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 100}
