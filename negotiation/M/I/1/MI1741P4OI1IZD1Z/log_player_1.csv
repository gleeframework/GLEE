Round 2
Bob's offer:

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a better price.  I'll see if I can negotiate a bit higher in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While it's tempting to close the deal, I'm still hopeful that I can get closer to my target price of $12,000.  I'll try one more counteroffer before considering selling to John."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $10,750 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference and go with $10,875. I'm confident this is a price we can both agree on."", ""product_price"": 10875}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not sure $10,875 is the right price for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to stay within my budget. How about $10,650? It's a fair compromise, and I think it's a price we can both live with.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John.  While I'd like to get closer to my target price of $12,000, I've reached a point where it's more beneficial to sell to John and avoid the risk of further negotiations with Bob. There are only a few rounds left, and I don't want to risk ending up with a lower price.  John is a guaranteed sale at my minimum acceptable price."
