,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $2,000,000 is simply outside my budget.  I'm very interested in this product, but I can't go higher than $1,200,000.  I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming back with an offer and acknowledging the product's value.  While $1,200,000 is a significant amount, the true worth of this product goes beyond that.  I'd be willing to part with it for $1,800,000.  I believe this reflects a more accurate valuation while still making it a worthwhile investment for you.",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective on the product's value.  However, $1,800,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go to $1,400,000.  This is a significant increase from my previous offer, and I believe it reflects the value of the product to me while still being within my budget.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
