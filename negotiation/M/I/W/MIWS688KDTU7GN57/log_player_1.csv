Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly.  I believe it would be highly valuable to you, and I'm willing to offer it at a significant discount. Would you be interested in purchasing it for $14,000?"", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Start with a price closer to Bob's maximum perceived value ($10,000). This maximizes potential profit if Bob accepts.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** The offer of $14,000 leaves some room for Bob to negotiate, potentially increasing the final price.
* **Time Value and Guaranteed Sale:** While John offers a guaranteed $15,000, selling to Bob quickly might be more desirable than waiting for the guaranteed sale. 
* **Perception of Value:** By mentioning a ""public listing"" and a ""significant discount,"" Alice aims to make the offer more enticing and create a sense of urgency. 

This strategy aims to strike a balance between getting the highest possible price from Bob while acknowledging the guaranteed sale to John."
