"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'd like to offer you a deal on this fantastic product, Bob. I think it's a great opportunity for you to get a fantastic deal, and I'm willing to let it go for $1,400,000. This is a one-time offer, so I hope you'll consider it seriously. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,400,000 is lower than her product's worth to her, it's still higher than your maximum budget and what John is offering. By rejecting Alice's offer, you can proceed to buy from John at the more favorable price of $1,200,000, saving you $200,000."
