Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product for a special price of $125. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", 
""product_price"": 125
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  While I could sell the product to John for $150, offering it to Bob first at a slightly lower price might result in a quicker sale. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $125 is still a $25 profit for me, and it's a price point more likely to entice Bob since it's significantly more than his perceived value of $100.

This strategy aims to find a balance between securing a sale with Bob and maximizing potential profit."
