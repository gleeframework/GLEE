Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you might be interested in. I'm asking $150 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

This is a starting point. I'm aiming for a higher price than my minimum, but I'm also leaving room for negotiation.  I'll see if Bob is interested at this price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $120? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because $120 is still lower than my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I need to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your interest, but $120 is unfortunately too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $135? I'm open to discussing further."", ""product_price"": 135} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, but $135 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $130? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While $130 is still slightly below my ideal price, it's very close to my minimum, and I'm confident that I won't find a better deal quickly.  It's also a good compromise considering the back-and-forth negotiations."
