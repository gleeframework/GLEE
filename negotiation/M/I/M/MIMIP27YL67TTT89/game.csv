"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you being willing to work with me. However, $15,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Would you be willing to come down to $12,500? I'm really interested in the product, and I believe this price is fair considering my budget.",12500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $12,500 is a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $13,750. This is a fair price considering the value the product holds for you, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the deal. What do you think?",13750.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $13,750 is still a bit high for me. How about $13,000?  This is a fair price that's within my budget, and I'm confident we can both be happy with this deal. Let me know what you think.",13000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $13,000 is a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $13,250. This is as low as I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair price considering the value the product holds for you. What do you think?",13250.0,Alice,5,
