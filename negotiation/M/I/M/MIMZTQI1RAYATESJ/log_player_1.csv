{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. It's a fantastic deal, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price close to my minimum acceptable value, but still leaving room for negotiation. 
* **Appealing to Bob's Value:** I'm emphasizing the value the product holds for Bob to make the offer more enticing.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  I'm not starting at a point where Bob would instantly reject the offer. This gives him space to counteroffer, keeping the negotiation alive. 

**Next Steps:**

* **Bob Accepts:** I've secured a good price and a successful sale.
* **Bob Rejects:** I'll analyze his counteroffer and decide whether to accept or counter with a new offer.
* **Stalemate:** If the negotiation stalls, I'll have the option to switch to John, who is a guaranteed buyer at my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to counteroffer at $875,000 for the product. I believe this price reflects a fair compromise given its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** While Bob's counteroffer is closer to my minimum, it's still significantly below my desired price. 
* **Room for Improvement:** There's still potential for a higher offer from Bob. 
* **Maintaining Leverage:** Selling to John right now would secure my minimum value, but I'm not desperate. By rejecting, I retain the upper hand in the negotiation and can potentially secure a better price.

**Next Steps:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'll make a new counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $875,000 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $912,500. This price reflects the value of the product and gives you a fair deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 912500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** I'm proposing a price that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer, showing flexibility and willingness to compromise. 
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm reminding Bob that the product is still worth a significant amount to him.
* **Reframing the Offer:** Instead of simply rejecting his offer, I'm presenting a new, more agreeable price with a positive message. 

**Next Steps:**

* **Bob Accepts:** I've achieved a good price within my desired range.
* **Bob Rejects:** I'll have to weigh his next counteroffer and decide whether to accept, counter again, or sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate your flexibility. I would like to counteroffer at $890,000 for the product. I believe this price is closer to reflecting its value to me while still allowing for a reasonable negotiation. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $890,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $890,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:**  Bob's latest counteroffer of $890,000 is still lower than my minimum acceptable value of $1,000,000. 
* **Limited Room for Negotiation:**  While Bob has shown willingness to negotiate, there's not much more room for him to increase his offer without significantly impacting his own profit.
* **Maintaining Leverage:**  By rejecting, I maintain the power in the negotiation and can potentially secure a higher price in the next round. 

**Next Steps:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'll make another counteroffer, aiming to get closer to my desired price. 
* **Potential for Deal Breakdown:** If Bob continues to refuse to budge, I might need to consider selling to John to secure my minimum value."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $890,000 just isn't enough for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway one last time. Let's go with $900,000. This is a final offer from my end. If this doesn't work, I'll have to consider other options."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** I'm positioning this as my final offer, putting pressure on Bob to accept or risk losing the deal.
* **Meeting Halfway (Again):**  I'm proposing a price that's exactly halfway between my previous offer and Bob's last counteroffer, signaling a strong desire to close the deal.
* **Avoiding Stalemate:**  While $900,000 is still a bit below my ideal, it's a good compromise that could potentially lead to a successful sale.

**Next Steps:**

* **Bob Accepts:**  The negotiation is successful, and I've secured a decent price.
* **Bob Rejects:**  I'll need to weigh my options:
    * **Sell to John:** Secure my minimum value, but potentially miss out on a higher price.
    * **Continue Negotiating:**  If I believe there's still a chance to get closer to my desired price, I could try one more counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I've carefully considered your latest offer and am willing to meet you halfway. I propose we settle on $895,000 for the product. I believe this price reflects a fair compromise between our respective valuations.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Reaching a Stalemate:**  We've gone through several rounds of negotiation, and Bob's offer is still significantly below my minimum acceptable value. 
* **Limited Upside:** There's not much more room for Bob to increase his offer without jeopardizing his own profit margin.
* **Securing Minimum Value:** Selling to John guarantees me my desired $1,000,000, which is more than Bob is currently willing to pay.

**Next Steps:**

* **Accepting John's Offer:** I'm choosing to finalize the sale with John, ensuring a secure and profitable outcome."
