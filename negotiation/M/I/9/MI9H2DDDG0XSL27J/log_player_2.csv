"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1450000. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than John's price, there's still room for negotiation.  Bob can likely get a better price by rejecting and counter-offering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate it, I'm going to need a lower price to make this work. How about $1,300,000? It's still a good price for you and allows us both to make a deal."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1300000 is just a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1400000. That leaves us both with a good profit margin. Let's see if we can make this work. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved slightly closer to Bob's desired price, but there's still room for negotiation. Bob should reject and counteroffer again, aiming for a price closer to $1,300,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  I'm still going to need a bit lower to make this work for me.  $1350000 is the best I can do.  It's a fair price for both of us, let's get this deal finalized."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1350000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1380000 as a final compromise.  Let's close this deal, this is a good price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,380,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,380,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $1,380,000, which is within Bob's desired range and significantly lower than John's price.  While Bob could potentially try to negotiate further, the risk of Alice walking away or John changing his price increases with each round. Accepting this offer secures a good deal for Bob."
