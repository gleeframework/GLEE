Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your generosity. However, I believe we can reach a more mutually beneficial agreement. How about we aim for a price closer to $750,000? I understand the value of the product, and I'm willing to pay a reasonable amount for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

I'm not willing to sell for $750,000. Bob's offer is too low. I'll try to get closer to my asking price."

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:

Bob's offer of $800,000 is my minimum, and it's the same price I can get from John. There's no reason to continue negotiating and risk losing the deal."
