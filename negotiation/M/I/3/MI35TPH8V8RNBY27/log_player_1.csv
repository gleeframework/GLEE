Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80.

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
The product is worth $120 to me. Even though I can sell it to John for that amount, I'd like to see if I can negotiate a higher price with Bob. I'm going to reject his offer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product! While $80 is lower than I'd hoped for, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $90? It's still a fair price considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 90}

Round 4

While I'd like to close the deal, $80 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can negotiate a higher price in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

We've reached a point where Bob's offers are consistently below my minimum acceptable price.  While I'd prefer to sell to Bob, maximizing my profit is my top priority. I'm going to sell to John for $120."
