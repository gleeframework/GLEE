"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $110 for it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.** It's above your maximum price of $120. 
* **You want to negotiate.**  There's room for a better deal, and you have 10 rounds to try. 
* **John's offer is your fallback.**  If negotiations fail, you can still get the product, but at a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $110 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in the product, but my budget is closer to $95. Would you be willing to consider that?"", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hey Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $95 is a bit too low for me.  Could you meet me halfway at $102? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $102. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $102
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still higher than your ideal price.**  While it's closer to your budget, you can likely get a better deal with further negotiation.
* **There's still room to bargain.** You have 7 rounds left, and Alice is showing flexibility.
* **John's offer is still your fallback.** You can always go to John if the negotiation fails."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm willing to go up to $100, but that's my absolute limit. Let's see if we can reach a deal."", ""product_price"": 100}
