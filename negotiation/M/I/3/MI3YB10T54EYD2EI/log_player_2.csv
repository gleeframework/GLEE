"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $18,000. It's a fantastic deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's starting offer is significantly above your maximum price. You should reject this offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $18,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $12,000?"",
""product_price"": 12000
}
``` 

This counter-offer aims to bring the price closer to your desired range while leaving room for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints.  I'm willing to come down to $16,000, which is still a great deal considering the value you'll get from this product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Alice is moving closer to your desired price range, it's still above your ideal and John's price. Rejecting and countering again keeps the negotiation open for a potentially better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. How about we meet in the middle at $14,000? That feels like a fair deal for both of us."",
""product_price"": 14000
}
```

We're getting closer! This counteroffer splits the difference between Alice's last offer and your previous counteroffer, making it a strong negotiating point. It keeps the negotiation moving while staying under your $15,000 maximum."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating with you. However, $14,000 is just a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $15,500, which is a good compromise. Let's make this deal happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is getting very close to John's price, but it's still worthwhile to see if you can get her closer to your $14,000 offer.  There's a chance she might accept a price slightly lower than $15,500, saving you a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, we're almost there! I understand this product has value, so I'm willing to offer $14,500.  That's a fair compromise and a great price for this item. What do you say?"",
""product_price"": 14500
}
```

This counteroffer shows Alice you're serious about buying but want to save some money. By suggesting a specific price, it might encourage her to accept instead of continuing a potentially lengthy back-and-forth."
