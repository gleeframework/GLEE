"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $8,200 is a little too low for me. How about we split the difference at $8,800? I believe this is still a great value for you, and I'm eager to see you enjoy the product.",8800.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit hesitant to pay $8,800. I was thinking more along the lines of $8,300. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget. Can you meet me at this price?",8300.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I see we're getting closer to an agreement.  While I appreciate your offer, I need to stay closer to my target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $8,500.  This is a fair compromise, and I believe you'll find the product worth every penny. Let's make this deal happen!",8500.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still trying to stretch my budget as far as I can. I'd like to make a final offer of $8,200. If you can meet me at this price, I'll be happy to make the purchase. If not, I'm afraid I'll have to consider buying from John for $10,000.",8200.0,Bob,6,
