"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product I think you'd be interested in. It's valued at over $15,000 to me, but I'm open to a fair negotiation. I'm offering it to you for $20,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 20000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $20000 is a bit steep. I'd be willing to pay $15000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $15,000 is the minimum I'm willing to accept, I'm hoping to get closer to my initial asking price. I believe there's room for negotiation, and I want to see if Bob is willing to budge."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $15,000 is a good starting point, I'm hoping for a price that reflects the value of the product to me.  I'm willing to come down a bit and offer it to you for $17,500. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 17500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $17500 is still a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to meet you in the middle at $12500. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $12,500 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  While I could continue negotiating, I'm not confident he'll come up to a price I'm comfortable with.  John is a guaranteed sale at $15,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. I'd rather secure the sale with John than risk losing more time and potentially getting a worse price from Bob."
