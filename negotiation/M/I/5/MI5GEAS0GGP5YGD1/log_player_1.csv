Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a possible offer, keeping in mind Alice's goals:

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exclusive opportunity to purchase [product name].  I know you recognize its value, and I believe a price of $950,000 reflects its significance in the market. This is a limited-time offer, as I do have other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 950000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Alice knows Bob values the product at $800,000 and wants to maximize her profit. Starting high leaves room for negotiation.
* **Justification for price:** By highlighting the product's value and exclusivity, Alice provides a rationale for the higher price, making it seem less arbitrary.
* **Sense of urgency:**  Mentioning ""other interested parties"" (even if it's just John) encourages Bob to act quickly and potentially avoid losing the deal.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Market dynamics:** This strategy assumes a somewhat competitive market where buyers might be willing to pay a premium. 
* **Bob's personality:**  If Alice knows Bob to be a tough negotiator or highly price-sensitive, a slightly lower initial offer might be more strategic."
