"Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you a unique product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential worth, I'm proposing an initial price of $925,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts?",925000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $925,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your interest and counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but $700,000 is significantly below its true value. How about we meet in the middle at $850,000?",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $850,000 is still a little high for my budget.  Could you do $775,000?",775000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm seeing a gap between our valuations.  While I want to find a solution, I must price it fairly. How about $812,000? This is my final offer.",812000.0,Alice,5,
