Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product at a premium price of $14,000. I believe it holds significant value and could benefit you greatly."", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed offer from John at $15,000, aiming slightly lower with Bob at $14,000 increases the chance of a quick sale. 
* **Strategic Pricing:**  The $14,000 price point is still significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($12,000), giving me room for negotiation if needed.  
* **""Premium"" Framing:**  Positioning the product as ""premium"" might make Bob more inclined to accept a higher price, even if it's above his initial valuation. 

**Important Note:**  There's always a risk Bob will reject the offer. However, this strategy balances risk with the potential for a higher profit than selling directly to John."
