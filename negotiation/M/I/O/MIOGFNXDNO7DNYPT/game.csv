"I understand you're looking for a better deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $12000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $16000. It's still a great value considering its worth to you is $10000. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate the willingness to meet me halfway, but $16000 is still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to pay $14000 for the product.",14000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm getting close to my minimum price, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $14000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $17000. It's still a good deal for you, and I'm getting close to my desired price. What do you think?",17000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to make concessions, but $17000 is still a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $13500 for the product.",13500.0,Bob,6,
