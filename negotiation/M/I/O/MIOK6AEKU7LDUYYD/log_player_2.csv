# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand that $900,000 might be a stretch for you, but I'm still quite attached to the price I had in mind. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. How about we meet at $850,000? It's still a great price for you, and I think it's a fair compromise.

I'm willing to meet you halfway between $850,000 and $775,000, which would be $812,500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.
