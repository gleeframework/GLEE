"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I believe it's a game-changer and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to make a serious offer to you today. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $900,000. This is a one-time offer, so I hope you'll consider it carefully.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit steep for me. How about we meet in the middle at $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand that $900,000 might be a stretch for you, but I'm still quite attached to the price I had in mind. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. How about we meet at $850,000? It's still a great price for you, and I think it's a fair compromise.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $850,000 is closer, but still a bit high for me. How about we split the difference again and land at $775,000? ",775000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $850,000 is still a bit high for you, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $775,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $850,000 and $775,000, which would be $812,500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",812500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you've been very reasonable and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $812,500 is very tempting, I think I need to stay firm around $800,000.  If you're willing to meet me there, I'm ready to close the deal.",800000.0,Bob,6,
