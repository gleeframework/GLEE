"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to purchase this exceptional product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $20,000.",20000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $20,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $12,000?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $20,000 is a bit high for you, but I have to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $18,000. I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. However,  $18,000 is still a bit too steep for my budget.  Could we settle at $14,000?",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I see you're willing to go down to $14,000, Bob. I appreciate your flexibility. However, I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'm counteroffering at $17,000. I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you, and it's the lowest I'm willing to go.",17000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand this is your lowest price, but I'm afraid I'm reaching my limit.  I can offer $14,500.  If that doesn't work, I'll have to consider my other options.",14500.0,Bob,6,
