# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for $120. I think it's a great value and I'm confident you'll love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json

While Alice's offer is lower than her product's value to her, it's still significantly more than your $80 limit and what John is offering. You can save money by going with John."
