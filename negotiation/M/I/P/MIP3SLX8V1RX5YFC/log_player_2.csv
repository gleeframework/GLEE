"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic product that I believe will be highly valuable to you. Given its potential, I'm proposing an initial price of $1,400,000. I'm confident this is a fair offer considering the significant benefits you'll reap. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is higher than my maximum budget of $1,500,000.  It's better to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price.  There's a possibility of getting a better deal with Alice, and even if I don't, I can still buy from John as a backup."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in the product, $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for it. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you countering.  I'm willing to negotiate, but $1,250,000 is too low for me to consider.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,325,000? This reflects the true value of the product while still offering you a great deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,325,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above my preferred price point, but it's getting closer.  I'm going to reject and counteroffer again, hoping to get closer to my desired price. I want to keep negotiating and avoid buying from John at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,325,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,300,000. This would be a good deal for both of us and allow me to move forward with the purchase."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
