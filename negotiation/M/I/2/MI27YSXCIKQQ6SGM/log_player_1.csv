"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I believe a starting price of $1,400,000 is fair. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm aiming high initially to give myself room to negotiate down.  
* **Leaving Room for Profit:** This price ensures a significant profit above my minimum, while still leaving Bob with a potential gain.
* **Polite and Professional Tone:** Building rapport is important, even in negotiations. I want Bob to feel like we're working towards a mutually beneficial deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I would like to propose a lower price of $1,300,000. I hope we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,300,000 is a good profit, I'm confident I can negotiate a better deal. Bob's counteroffer suggests he's willing to pay a significant amount for the product. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer to see if I can capture more of the value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Bob. I see your point, but the value of this product is truly significant. I can come down slightly to $1,375,000.  This price reflects the true worth of what I'm offering."",
""product_price"": 1375000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** I'm showing flexibility by coming down from my initial offer, but only slightly. This signals that I'm serious about maximizing my profit.
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm reiterating the product's value to justify the higher price and keep Bob engaged in the negotiation.
* **Seeking a Middle Ground:** This counteroffer aims for a price point that's closer to my initial ask while still leaving room for a potential compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a price of $1,350,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with our interests. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Profit:**  $1,350,000 represents a significant profit margin above my minimum price of $1,200,000.
* **Diminishing Returns:** While I could try to negotiate further, Bob's increments are getting smaller. It's unlikely I'll get much closer to my initial ask. 
* **Time Value:**  Dragging out the negotiation carries the risk of Bob losing interest or finding an alternative. Accepting now secures the deal."
