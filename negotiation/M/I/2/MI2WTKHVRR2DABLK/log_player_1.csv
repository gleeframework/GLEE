{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 

This offer is above my minimum, giving me room to negotiate if Bob counters.  It's also within the realm of what Bob is willing to pay, making it a good starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in your product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,400,000. I've done some research and I think that's a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, I'm not willing to sell for that low. I believe there's still room for negotiation to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $1,400,000 is too low. How about we meet in the middle at $1,550,000? This is a good deal for both of us, allowing you to get the product and me to get a fair price."", ""product_price"": 1550000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $1,550,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $1,450,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum. While I could continue negotiating, the potential gains are minimal, and the risk of further rejection is high.  Selling to John at $1,500,000 is a sure thing and meets my minimum requirement."
