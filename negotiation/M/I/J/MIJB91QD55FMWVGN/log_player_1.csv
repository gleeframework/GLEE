Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be incredibly valuable to you, and I'm willing to part with it for $12,000. This is a limited-time offer, so please let me know your decision soon."",
""product_price"": 12000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, you want to see if Bob will pay more. 
* **Strategic Starting Point:** Starting at $12,000 leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  By mentioning a ""limited-time offer,"" you encourage Bob to make a decision quickly.

**Important Note:**  There's no guarantee Bob will accept $12,000.  This strategy aims to get the highest possible price but acknowledges the risk that Bob might decline."
