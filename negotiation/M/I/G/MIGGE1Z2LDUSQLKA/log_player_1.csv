Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting with a high offer, aiming for a good profit. I want to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to negotiate.  If he rejects, I'll evaluate his counteroffer and decide whether to continue negotiating or sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still lower than what I believe the product is worth. I'm going to reject his offer and counter with a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm lowering my price a bit, but still aiming for a good profit.  I'm hoping Bob will see that I'm serious about selling and will be willing to meet me somewhere in the middle."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,100,000 is better than John's offer, I'm still holding out for a better price. I'm going to counter with a price closer to Bob's offer, hoping we can reach an agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

```

I'm coming down to $1,250,000. This is a significant compromise on my part, but still a good deal for me.  I hope this will encourage Bob to make a final decision."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is clearly not willing to meet my price, and I'm getting tired of this back and forth.  While $1,050,000 is better than $1,000,000, I'm running the risk of losing time and potentially getting a lower price if I keep negotiating. It's time to cut my losses and sell to John."
