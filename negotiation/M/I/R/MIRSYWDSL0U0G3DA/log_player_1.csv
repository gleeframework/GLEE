Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're secure knowing John will buy the product for $1,000,000. This is your ""safety net.""
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,200,000, meaning there's a potential $200,000 surplus you could tap into. 
* **One-Shot Deal:** You have one chance with Bob. If he rejects your offer, you lose the chance to secure the extra profit.

**Strategy**

You want to aim high enough to capture a significant portion of that $200,000 surplus, but not so high that Bob walks away.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exclusive opportunity to acquire the product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Confident Tone:**  You project confidence in the product's value.
* **High but Justifiable Price:** $1,150,000 leaves Bob with a $50,000 gain, a strong incentive to buy. It also secures you a $150,000 profit above your minimum.
* **Urgency:**  Mentioning ""other interested parties"" (even if it's just John) creates a sense of scarcity and encourages a faster decision.

**Important Note:** There's always a risk Bob might reject the offer.  However, this strategy optimizes your chance of maximizing your profit while still leaving Bob with a favorable deal."
