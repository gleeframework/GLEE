Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:** This gives Bob some room to negotiate while still leaving you with a profit.
* **It's below your minimum:** It allows for some potential negotiation and doesn't immediately push you to John's offer.
* **It's a strong opening:** It shows you're serious about selling to Bob, but also confident in the product's worth."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Bob's offer is significantly below my minimum acceptable price.  While I would prefer to sell to Bob, I need to hold firm on my value.  I'll counteroffer to keep the negotiation going."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $900,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.  This price still reflects the value of the product, but also shows my willingness to negotiate.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $975,000. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000

While $975,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still not enough. I'm confident in the product's value and want to see if we can bridge the gap further. I'll counteroffer again."

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm close to walking away, but I'm willing to make one more offer. I'll meet you at $990,000. This is my final offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $990,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $990,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While I'd prefer to sell to Bob, his offer of $990,000 is still too low. It's getting close to my minimum, but I'm not comfortable with that price and don't want to risk him walking away.  

I'm confident that John is a secure buyer, and his offer of $1,200,000 is more than enough to meet my needs. It's time to end the negotiation with Bob and move on to a guaranteed sale with John."
