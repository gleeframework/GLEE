"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you're looking for a good deal.  $120 is a bit lower than I'm comfortable with, but I'm willing to come down to $160. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think?",160.0,Alice,3,

,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $140 is still a bit below what I'm comfortable with. How about we split the difference and settle on $145? It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product, and it gives us both a good deal. What do you say?",145.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $145. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so how about $130?",130.0,Bob,6,
