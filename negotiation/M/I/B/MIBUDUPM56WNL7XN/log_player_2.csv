``` 

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial price, but still within a reasonable range. I'm hoping to create a starting point for negotiation and see how Alice responds."

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $850,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. I'd like to counteroffer at $1,100,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider at this point.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,100,000 is still outside my budget. I'm sticking to my initial offer of $850,000.

```

**Reasoning:**

I'm holding firm on my counteroffer of $850,000. I'm signaling to Alice that I'm serious about this price and that I'm willing to walk away if necessary. I hope this will encourage her to be more flexible in her negotiations."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $850,000 is a significant compromise, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'd like to make a new offer of $1,050,000. This is the best I can do at this point, and I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $1,050,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm going to offer $950,000. This is my final offer, and if it's not acceptable, I'll need to consider other options.  Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm raising my counteroffer slightly, but it's still significantly lower than Alice's offer. This shows that I'm willing to negotiate, but also that I'm not willing to go much higher. I'm hoping that this counteroffer will be enough to convince Alice to accept the deal, as I'm also hinting that I'm nearing the end of my negotiation flexibility."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $950,000 is a good offer, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'd like to make a new offer of $1,025,000. This is the best I can do at this point, and I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, we're getting closer, but $1,025,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm going to stick with my previous offer of $950,000. This is the best I can do, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us. If you're not willing to accept it, I'm afraid I'll need to consider other options."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm holding firm at my previous offer of $950,000.  I'm reiterating that it's my final offer and that I'm prepared to walk away if necessary. I'm hoping this will put pressure on Alice to accept, as we are running out of time in our negotiation."

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that we're close, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at $950,000. I'd like to make a new offer of $1,000,000. This is the best I can do at this point, and I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.

Alice's offer is still above my budget, but we're getting close. With one round remaining, I'm going to try one last counteroffer to see if I can reach an agreement. It's risky, but it could lead to a better price. If it fails, I'll buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 10
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, this is our final round. I'm willing to go up to $975,000, but that's my absolute maximum. It's a fair price, and it would be a shame to let this deal fall apart.  If this isn't acceptable, I'll need to go with another vendor."", ""product_price"": 975000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm raising my counteroffer slightly, but only by a small amount. This shows Alice I'm serious about getting a deal, but I'm also at my limit.  I'm putting the ball in her court, hoping she'll accept to avoid missing out on the deal. If she rejects, I'll move on to John."
