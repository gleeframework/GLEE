"Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product. I'm excited to discuss the details with you. As we begin our negotiation, I'd like to start with an offer of $1,200,000 for the product.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay right now. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $850,000 at this point. What do you think?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $850,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. I'd like to counteroffer at $1,100,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider at this point.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,100,000 is still outside my budget. I'm sticking to my initial offer of $850,000. This is the highest I can go at this point.  If we can't find common ground here, I may have to explore other options.",850000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $850,000 is a significant compromise, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'd like to make a new offer of $1,050,000. This is the best I can do at this point, and I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $1,050,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm going to offer $950,000. This is my final offer, and if it's not acceptable, I'll need to consider other options.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",950000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that $950,000 is a good offer, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'd like to make a new offer of $1,025,000. This is the best I can do at this point, and I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1025000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer, but $1,025,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm going to stick with my previous offer of $950,000. This is the best I can do, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us. If you're not willing to accept it, I'm afraid I'll need to consider other options.",950000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I understand that we're close, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at $950,000. I'd like to make a new offer of $1,000,000. This is the best I can do at this point, and I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1000000.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"Alice, this is our final round. I'm willing to go up to $975,000, but that's my absolute maximum. It's a fair price, and it would be a shame to let this deal fall apart.  If this isn't acceptable, I'll need to go with another vendor.",975000.0,Bob,10,
