"Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $9,500 is a good deal, Bob can potentially get a better price by rejecting and counteroffering.  The product is worth $8,000 to Alice, so there is room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer offers a significant discount from Alice's initial price while still leaving room for negotiation. It is reasonable to assume Alice would be willing to accept a price closer to her value of $8,000, especially if she wants to make a sale."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $9,200 is still a good deal for Bob, as it is below his maximum budget of $10,000 and closer to Alice's value of $8,000. There is a risk that continuing to negotiate could lead to a counteroffer from Alice that is higher, or even a rejection of Bob's next counteroffer. Accepting this offer ensures Bob gets the product at a good price with minimal risk."
