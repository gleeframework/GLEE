"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $14,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product. Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's close this deal!",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand you're looking for a fair price. How about we meet in the middle at $11,500? This seems like a reasonable compromise.",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're trying to meet in the middle, but $11,500 is still a bit too low for me. Let's go with $12,500. This is a fair price that's closer to what I'm looking for, and it's still a good deal for you since the product is worth $12,000 to you. What do you say?",12500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're getting closer! I'm willing to stretch my budget a bit, but $12,500 is still a touch high for me. How about we settle at $12,100? It's a fair deal for both of us.",12100.0,Bob,6,
