"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I appreciate you taking the time to talk to me. However, $11,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm prepared to pay $10,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still a bit above your target. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $10,800. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's a fair compromise considering the product's value to you.",10800.0,Alice,3,
