Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product, which I believe would be highly beneficial to you. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000. I'm confident this represents a fair deal considering its worth."", 
""product_price"": 1200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,500,000. 
* **Your Minimum:** You need at least $800,000.
* **Maximizing Profit:**  By offering the product at $1,200,000, you're aiming for a price that's significantly higher than your minimum but still leaves Bob with a potential profit margin ($1,500,000 - $1,200,000 = $300,000). This increases the likelihood of him accepting the offer. 

This strategy balances your desire for maximum profit with the need to make the deal attractive enough for Bob to accept."
