"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,000,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $600,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This takes into account your needs and allows for a reasonable profit for me. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. How about we meet in the middle at $725,000? That seems like a fair deal for both of us.",725000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $725,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $800,000, which is a significant concession on my part. Let's find a solution that works for both of us. ",800000.0,Alice,5,
