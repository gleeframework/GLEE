Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 200}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $200. This is a significant markup from my minimum, but I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium. I'm prepared to negotiate lower if necessary, but I want to gauge his interest first."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $150 is my minimum, I'm not eager to accept it right away. Bob's offer shows he's willing to negotiate, so I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer.  I want to see if I can squeeze out a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm countering with $175. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer. It's still above my minimum, but it shows I'm willing to negotiate. I'm hoping Bob will see the value in the product and be willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $155. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $155
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $155 is just above my minimum and represents a small gain over selling to John. While I would prefer a higher price, I'm willing to accept it to avoid further negotiation and the risk of losing the deal altogether."
