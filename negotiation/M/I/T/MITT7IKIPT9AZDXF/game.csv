"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9000. This is a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product. Let's make this deal happen.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $8750 is still a bit too low. Let's split the difference - I'll come down to $8875.  This is my final offer, and it's a fair price that allows us both to get what we want.",8875.0,Alice,5,
