"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. I believe it's a great value given its worth to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This initial offer is a good starting point.  It's a bit higher than my minimum acceptable price, but still leaves room for negotiation.  It also shows Bob that I'm serious about selling the product, but am not desperate to sell it at any price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to spend a bit less. How about $8500? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, I'm going to try to push for a better price. I've got 8 rounds left, so there's time to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This is a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product. Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $9000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $8750.  This is a fair compromise and I'm confident this product is worth that much to me. Let's meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $8,750 is still a bit too low. Let's split the difference - I'll come down to $8,875.  This is my final offer, and it's a fair price that allows us both to get what we want."", ""product_price"": 8875}
