Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product, which I believe would be highly beneficial for you. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. This is a fair offer considering its potential worth to you."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to $1,500,000 (Bob's perceived value) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $1,400,000 leaves room for Bob to potentially negotiate down a little, while still ensuring a significant profit for you.
* **Alternative Buyer:**  Knowing you have John as a backup at $1,200,000 gives you leverage. You're not desperate, so you can aim high with Bob.

**Important:**  This strategy assumes you have no information about Bob's negotiation style or how badly he needs the product. If you had more information, you could potentially adjust your approach."
