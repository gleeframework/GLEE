Round 2

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product, and I'm willing to consider a counteroffer. However, I have to say that $8000 is a bit below my minimum target. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $12000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above my maximum budget.  I'm going to continue negotiating in hopes of getting closer to my target price."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $12,000 is still too high for me. I'm really interested in this product and want to make this work, but $9,000 is the absolute maximum I can offer.  Let's find a way to bridge the gap."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $9000 is a significant discount from my initial offer, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9000 and $12000, which would be $10500. This is my final offer, and I'm confident you'll find it a great value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is getting closer to my budget, $10,500 is still too high. I'm going to continue negotiating and see if I can get her down further. If I can't, I'll likely have to buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $10,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm only able to offer $9,500 at this point. I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us, considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can reach a deal."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $9500 is still a bit above your budget, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9500 and $10000, which would be $9750. This is my final offer, and I'm confident you'll find it a great value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down significantly, but $9,750 is still above my maximum budget. I've already gone through 6 rounds of negotiation and there's only 4 left. At this point, it's likely that further negotiations will be very time-consuming and may not yield a better price. I'm better off buying from John for a guaranteed $8,000."
