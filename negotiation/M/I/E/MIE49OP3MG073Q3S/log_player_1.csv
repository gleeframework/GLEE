"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it's worth a lot. I'm offering it to you for $145.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 145}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value ($120) but below my minimum price ($150). This allows room for negotiation.
* **Positive framing:** I use a positive and friendly tone to encourage Bob to consider the offer.
* **Open to negotiation:** The message implies I'm willing to discuss the price, which might make Bob more likely to counteroffer rather than immediately rejecting."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I think that price is a little high for me. Would you consider $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $100 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150, and even lower than Bob's own perceived value. 
* **Room for negotiation:**  I believe I can still secure a better price by continuing the negotiation.
* **Selling to John is not ideal:** While selling to John guarantees $150, I prefer to explore better options with Bob first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $125?  I'm open to discussing this further."", ""product_price"": 125}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm proposing a compromise by meeting Bob halfway between his initial offer ($100) and my previous offer ($145). This shows I'm willing to negotiate.
* **Maintaining my minimum:** The price is still above my minimum acceptable price ($150), ensuring I won't lose money.
* **Openness:** I use language like ""split the difference"" and ""open to discussing"" to show I'm willing to negotiate further if needed."
