"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $850,000. It's a valuable piece, and I believe this price reflects its worth. I'm open to negotiation, but I'm confident we can reach an agreement that benefits both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 850000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value to leave room for negotiation.
* **Positive and collaborative tone:** I'm emphasizing a win-win scenario and open communication to encourage Bob to engage.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** I acknowledge that I'm open to negotiation, but maintain confidence in the initial offer. 

This strategy allows for a potential negotiation while securing a good starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I'm looking to save as much as possible. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering its worth to you is $800,000. I'm open to further negotiation, but I'm hoping we can meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, it's still below my desired price. I'm willing to negotiate further, hoping to secure a higher price.  

I believe there's still room for a deal that benefits both of us, and rejecting this offer keeps the negotiation process open."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking to get a good deal. While I appreciate your offer, I'm not quite ready to settle at that price. I'm willing to come down to $800,000, my minimum price. This is a fair offer considering the value of the product and the potential for a long-term relationship. Let's meet in the middle and make this happen."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Firm but fair:** I'm firm on my minimum price while acknowledging Bob's desire for a good deal.
* **Highlighting the value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's worth and the potential for a positive future relationship.
* **Meeting in the middle:** I'm suggesting a compromise to encourage Bob to accept. 

This approach aims to find a middle ground while remaining firm on my bottom line."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $800,000, Alice. However, I'm still looking to save some money. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $775,000. I think this is a fair compromise considering the value of the product and our negotiation so far. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $775,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob has moved closer to my minimum price, and while I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, accepting his offer at $775,000 is a good deal. It's still a significant profit for me, and the risk of further negotiation might lead to a lower offer or a stalemate. 

Selling to John for $800,000 is still an option, but I'm confident that this deal with Bob is a good compromise, and the risk of losing the sale to John is too high at this point."
