Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm asking for $20,000.  I believe this is a fair price considering its worth to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 20000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always best to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest.
* **Justification:** By mentioning the product's value, you provide a reason for the higher price, making it seem less arbitrary. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone is open-ended, inviting Bob to engage in a discussion about the price.  

**Important Note:**  While John offers a safety net at $15,000,  it's essential to avoid appearing desperate or revealing this information to Bob. Doing so would weaken your negotiating position."
