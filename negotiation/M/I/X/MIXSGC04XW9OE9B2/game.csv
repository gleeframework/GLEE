"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $110. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!",110.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $110 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $85 for it.  Let me know what you think.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is a little too low for me.  How about we split the difference and I sell it to you for $92.50?  That's still a good price for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired value.  Let me know what you think!",92.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $92.50 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Let's meet in the middle at $88.50. This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident it's a deal we can both agree on.",88.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $88.50 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little more to $90.  This would be a fair compromise that allows both of us to get what we want.  Let's close this deal!",90.0,Alice,5,
