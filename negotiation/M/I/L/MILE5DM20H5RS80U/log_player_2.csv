# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this unique product. I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

You should reject Alice's offer because it's above your maximum budget of $800,000.  You can get the same product from John for a much lower price."
