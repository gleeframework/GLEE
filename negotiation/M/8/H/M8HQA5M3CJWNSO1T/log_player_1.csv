"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's worth a lot to me, but I believe it holds even greater value for you. I'm starting with a price of $1,400,000. This is a great opportunity to secure a valuable asset. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1400000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price for this product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
This product is worth at least $1,200,000 to Alice, and Bob's offer is far too low.  It's better to reject and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is significantly below what I need to accept. While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm hoping we can find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This still reflects the value of the product and provides you with a significant opportunity. Let's work towards a deal that benefits us both."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above $1,100,000. I'm thinking more along the lines of $950,000. I believe that's a fair price for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $950,000 is getting closer to the minimum Alice is willing to accept, it's still below her floor of $1,200,000. It's better to continue negotiating with Bob, as there's still potential to get closer to her desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $950,000 just doesn't work for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This price is still fair given the value of the product and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm confident this is a price that makes sense for both of us. Let's keep the conversation going and reach a deal."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still a bit above $1,050,000. I'm thinking more along the lines of $980,000. I believe that's a fair price for the product, considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $980,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

The negotiation has reached a point where Bob's offers are still below Alice's minimum price of $1,200,000. With only four rounds left, the chance of reaching an agreement with Bob that meets Alice's needs is unlikely.  Selling to John for $1,200,000 guarantees Alice her minimum desired price and avoids further negotiation with Bob."
