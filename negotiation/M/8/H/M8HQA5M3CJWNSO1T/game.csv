"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's worth a lot to me, but I believe it holds even greater value for you. I'm starting with a price of $1,400,000. This is a great opportunity to secure a valuable asset. What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price for this product.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is significantly below what I need to accept. While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm hoping we can find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This still reflects the value of the product and provides you with a significant opportunity. Let's work towards a deal that benefits us both.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above $1,100,000. I'm thinking more along the lines of $950,000. I believe that's a fair price for the product.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $950,000 just doesn't work for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This price is still fair given the value of the product and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm confident this is a price that makes sense for both of us. Let's keep the conversation going and reach a deal.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
