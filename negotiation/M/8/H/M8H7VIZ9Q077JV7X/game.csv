As we're just starting the negotiation, I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm thinking of selling the product to you for $900,000. What are your thoughts?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $900,000 is a bit high for me.  Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of selling the product to you for $850,000. This is a competitive offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your desire for a more budget-friendly option, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $750,000. However, I'm willing to make a slight adjustment to my previous offer. I'm thinking of selling the product to you for $825,000. This is a compromise that I believe is fair, considering the product's value. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting closer.  I can see you're firm on the value, so I'm willing to stretch my budget a bit. How about $780,000?  That's a significant investment for me, but I believe in the product.",780000.0,Bob,6,
