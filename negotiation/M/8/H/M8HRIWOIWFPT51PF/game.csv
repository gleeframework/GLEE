"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $650,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $700,000. This is a compromise that I'm willing to make to reach a deal.",700000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand your hard limit, but I'm still not comfortable going that low. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm counteroffering at $680,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price for the product.",680000.0,Alice,5,
