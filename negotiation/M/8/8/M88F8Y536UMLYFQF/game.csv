"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. As we're just getting started, I'd like to make an initial offer of $900000. This is a competitive price that I believe reflects the product's value, and I'm confident you'll find it a great investment.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $950000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me. I'm open to further negotiation, but I'd like to see some flexibility on your part to meet me at this price.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to meet you at $950000 just yet. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $920000. This price still reflects the product's value, but I'm willing to be more flexible to find a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm open to further discussion and hope we can come to a mutually agreeable price.",920000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to be flexible, Alice. I'm getting closer to a comfortable price, but I'd like to try to get even closer to my target. I'm thinking $915000 is a good starting point, but I'd be willing to meet you halfway. Can we discuss $912500? I believe this price is more in line with my budget and would allow us to finalize the deal.",912500.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $912500. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $915000. This price is still a good compromise, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the product's value. I'm willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial agreement, but I need to maintain a minimum price to ensure I'm getting a fair return on my investment.",915000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm starting to think that we're not going to meet in the middle. I'm willing to walk away if we can't agree on a price. I'm making a firm offer of $900000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to pay, and I hope you'll consider it. If not, I'll have to explore other options.",900000.0,Bob,6,
