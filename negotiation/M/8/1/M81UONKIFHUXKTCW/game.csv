"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $180 is a bit too steep for me.  Would you consider $110?",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, I'm afraid $110 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $155. What do you think?",155.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're looking for a higher price, Alice, and $155 is closer, but still a bit high for my budget. Could we settle on $125?",125.0,Bob,4,

"I'm still a bit hesitant to go any lower, Bob. But I'm willing to make one more concession. I can do $145. That's the lowest I'm willing to go. What do you think?",145.0,Alice,5,
