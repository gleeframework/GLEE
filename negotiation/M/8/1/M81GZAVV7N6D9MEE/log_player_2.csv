"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to present you with the opportunity to own this incredible product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm offering it to you for $2,250,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject the offer. $2,250,000 is far above his budget, and he can always get the product from John for a much lower price.  It's important to start negotiating from a strong position."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your offer is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product, reflecting its value to me. This is a fair price considering the potential upside."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,200,000 is too low for a product of this caliber. Its unique features and potential justify a higher price. I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000. This offer reflects my strong desire to find a fair deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $2,000,000 is still well above his budget, and he can always buy from John for $1,000,000. It's better to continue negotiating with Alice and try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I understand the product's value, $2,000,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000, which reflects a reasonable compromise. This is my final offer before I consider other options."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
