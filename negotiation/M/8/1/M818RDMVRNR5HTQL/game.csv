"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $750,000. This is a great price considering its value to you is $800,000. I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts.",750000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you coming down to $750,000, but I'm looking to get this product for closer to $700,000.  I think that's a fair price considering its value to both of us. Let's see if we can find some common ground.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your perspective, but I'm not comfortable going down to $700,000. Considering the product's value to you is $800,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering it to you for $725,000. This is a fair compromise that still gives you a good deal while allowing me to earn a decent profit.",725000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down further, but $725,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $710,000.  This price gives you a solid profit while still allowing me to get a good deal. Let's try to close this deal.",710000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your willingness to compromise, but I'm not ready to give up yet. I'm willing to meet you at $720,000, which is still a good profit for me. I think this price is fair considering the product's value to you. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",720000.0,Alice,5,
