Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I see the value in this product,  $1,150,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,075,000. Let's see if we can close the gap.

While Bob is moving closer to my price, the increments are getting smaller and we're still significantly apart. It's not worth the risk of continuing negotiations and potentially ending up with a much lower offer. John offers a guaranteed $1,200,000, which is my minimum acceptable price."
