Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $10,000. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this is a fair price reflecting its worth."", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations with a higher price than your minimum. This gives you room to negotiate down if needed. 
* **Gauging Interest:** Bob's response to this initial offer will tell you a lot about his willingness to pay. If he outright rejects it, you can lower the price. If he counters, you know he's serious about buying.
* **Backup Plan:**  You have a guaranteed sale at $8,000 with John, so there's no pressure to accept a low offer from Bob."
