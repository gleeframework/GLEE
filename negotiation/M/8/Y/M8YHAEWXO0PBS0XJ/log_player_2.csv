"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. I know it's worth a lot to you, and I'm confident you'll find this price fair. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice's offer is above your maximum valuation. It makes sense to negotiate lower or consider John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $11,000 is a bit steep for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,000?"",
""product_price"": 9000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** We start with an offer significantly lower than Alice's asking price. This leaves room for negotiation and signals that we're serious about getting a good deal. 
* **Justification:** Offering a reason (""a bit steep"") makes the counteroffer feel less arbitrary.
* **Middle Ground:**  Suggesting ""$9,000"" aims for a price that's roughly halfway between Alice's initial offer and our ideal price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500, which is still a great deal for you considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can find a compromise here. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is coming down, but we're still above our ideal price and John's offer.  It's worth another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me. I'm willing to go up to $9,500, but that's my absolute limit. It's a fair price, and I'm hoping we can make a deal."",
""product_price"": 9500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Increase:** We're increasing our offer, but in a smaller increment than Alice's decrease. This shows we're negotiating but holding firm.
* **""Absolute Limit"":** Introducing a sense of finality can encourage Alice to make a decision.
* **Justification:**  Reiterating fairness and the desire to make a deal helps maintain a positive tone."
