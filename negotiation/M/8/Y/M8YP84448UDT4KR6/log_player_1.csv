"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'll reject Bob's offer. While $1,200,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly less than what I value the product at. I'll see if I can get a better price from Bob before selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1,300,000, reflecting a significant discount from my initial offer. This price still allows you to acquire a valuable product within a reasonable range. Let me know if you're willing to consider this offer."", ""product_price"": 1300000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1250000. Can you consider this offer?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'll reject Bob's offer again. While $1,250,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get closer to $1,300,000. I'll see if I can get Bob to move a bit higher before considering selling to John."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up on your offer, but $1,250,000 is still a little too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $1,275,000?  It's a fair compromise, and it would allow me to  move forward with the sale. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1275000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1240000, which is a bit above my initial offer, but I think it's a fair compromise. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,240,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,240,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While it's tempting to accept because it's a small increase,  I think I can still get a better price.  I'll counter with a slightly higher price and see if we can reach a compromise before I sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer, but $1,240,000 is still a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,260,000?

Round 8
Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,500,000.  Bob's offer is getting closer, but we're running out of time, and I'm not confident that we'll be able to reach a deal that meets my minimum.  Selling to John guarantees me the best price, and I don't want to risk getting stuck with a lower offer."
