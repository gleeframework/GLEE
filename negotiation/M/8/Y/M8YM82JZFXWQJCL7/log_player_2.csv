"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really enjoy. I'm starting with a price of $130. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product but $130 is a bit steep for me.  Would you be willing to come down to $100?"",
""product_price"": 100
}
```

I'm starting with a low counteroffer to see how much Alice is willing to budge. It's anchored at her value of the product, leaving room for negotiation while still being within my acceptable range."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest. $100 is unfortunately too low for me. How about we split the difference at $115? That's still a good deal for you, as you're getting it for less than you're willing to pay.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is moving in the right direction, but we're still a bit away from a price I'm fully comfortable with. It's worth seeing if I can negotiate her down a little further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand, $100 is a bit low. How about we meet in the middle at $110? That's a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 110
}
```

We're inching closer to a deal. This counteroffer shows Alice I'm willing to negotiate but also sets a firm boundary. It's a good balance between aiming for a lower price and avoiding stalling the negotiation."
