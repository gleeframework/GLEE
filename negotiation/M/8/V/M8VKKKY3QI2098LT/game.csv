"Bob, I believe this product has the potential to be incredibly valuable for your business. I'm offering it to you for $950,000.  This price reflects the significant value it brings and provides you with a solid margin for profit.  What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm very interested in the product, but $950,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the market value and my budget. What do you think?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints.  While $850,000 is a good starting point, I'm still a bit away from my desired price.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000.  This offer is a significant concession, and it allows for a healthy profit margin for both of us.  What do you say?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $900,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $875,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",875000.0,Bob,4,
