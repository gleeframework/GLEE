**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:** Buying from Alice for $1,000,000 saves you $200,000 compared to buying from John.
* **It's still within your budget:**  The $1,000,000 price is less than your maximum budget of $1,200,000. 

Therefore, accepting Alice's offer is the most financially advantageous decision."
