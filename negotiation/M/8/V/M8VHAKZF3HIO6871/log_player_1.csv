"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this incredible product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm asking for $2,300,000.  I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth."",
""product_price"": 2300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Start High:**  I'm beginning with a price significantly higher than both my minimum ($1,500,000) and Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000). This provides room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest and flexibility. 
* **Justification:** By highlighting the ""unique value and potential,"" I'm aiming to anchor the product's worth in Bob's mind at a higher level.
* **Confidence:** Projecting confidence in the offer can make it more persuasive.

This is just the opening move.  Depending on Bob's response, I'll adjust my strategy in subsequent rounds, always keeping in mind my bottom line and the guaranteed offer from John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice, but I'm not willing to pay $2,300,000. I'm willing to pay $1,800,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its worth to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,800,000 is a significant increase from his perceived value, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I believe there's room for further negotiation. I'm willing to counter in the next round to try and reach a more favorable agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up on the price. While your offer is generous, the value this product brings to the table is truly exceptional.  I'm willing to come down to $2,100,000. I believe this reflects a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 2100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Concession with Justification:** I acknowledge Bob's offer and make a counter-concession to show flexibility. However, I am keeping the price significantly above his offer,  reinforcing the idea of the product's high value. 
* **Compromise Language:**  Using phrases like ""fair compromise"" aims to create a more collaborative atmosphere for the negotiation.

I'm aiming to move the negotiation towards a price point closer to $1,800,000,  while remaining prepared to walk away if necessary.  The guaranteed offer from John provides me with leverage in this situation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that the product has exceptional value, Alice, but I'm still not willing to pay $2,100,000. I'm willing to pay $1,900,000 for the product. I think this is a reasonable compromise, considering my budget and the value I can get out of it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,900,000 is now above my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000 and provides a significant profit. While I could try to push for more in subsequent rounds, there's a risk that Bob might lower his offer or walk away altogether. Accepting this offer secures a favorable outcome for me in a reasonable timeframe."
