Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you first as a valued potential customer. I think it would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $140, let me know if you're interested!"", 
""product_price"": 140
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations a bit higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation (if Bob wants to) and increases the chance of a higher profit. 
* **Justification:** While not essential in this scenario, a simple justification like ""valued potential customer"" can make the offer feel less arbitrary.
* **Leaving Room:**  Even though John offers a fallback, aiming a bit higher than $120 allows for potential profit if Bob is willing to pay a premium."
