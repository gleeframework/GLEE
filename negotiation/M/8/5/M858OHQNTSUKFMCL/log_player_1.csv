Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a great deal for both of us. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

This is a starting point. It's a reasonable price considering the product is worth $1,200,000 to me and $1,000,000 to Bob. It leaves room for negotiation, but also sets a strong initial position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to spend a bit less. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $1,050,000 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum desired price of $1,200,000. I'll try to negotiate with Bob to get closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. This is a fair price that allows both of us to make a good deal. Let's try to find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  I'm still hoping to get a bit lower, though.  How about $1,100,000?  This would be a fair deal for both of us, allowing me to stay within my budget and you to still make a profit. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is close to my minimum desired price of $1,200,000. While I'd prefer to get closer to that amount, I don't want to risk losing the deal altogether. Accepting Bob's offer allows me to secure a sale and make a decent profit."
