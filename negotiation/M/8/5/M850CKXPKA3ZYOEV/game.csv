"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is a bit steep for me.  Given the value to both of us, I'm willing to pay $900,000. This price is fair and allows for a mutually beneficial deal. Let's see if we can find common ground.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $900,000 doesn't quite meet my needs.  Given the significant value this product offers you, I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement. ",950000.0,Alice,3,
