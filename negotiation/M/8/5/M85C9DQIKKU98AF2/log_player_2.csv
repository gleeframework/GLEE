"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a great opportunity for you! I'm offering you a unique product that I think you'll really like. Would you like to make an offer for it? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000

You should reject Alice's offer. It's above your target price of $12,000. You have room to negotiate a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $10,000 is a bit too high for me right now. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $9,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're interested in the product, Bob, but $9,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. How about we discuss $11,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
$11,000 is still above your target price, but it's getting closer. Continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11,000 is still a bit out of my range. How about we split the difference and settle on $10,500? This would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $10,500. I'm willing to give you a slight discount, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. How about we try $11,750? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

You're still above your target price of $12,000, but you're getting closer. Keep negotiating. It's worth trying to get a better deal before you buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to get closer to your minimum price, but I'm still not comfortable with $11,750.  How about we settle on $11,250? This would be a good compromise and a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 11250}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're close, Bob, but I still need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $11,250 and $11,750, which would be $11,500. Let's try that. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

You've reached a point where the negotiations are getting close, but it's unlikely you'll be able to get Alice down to your target price of $12,000.  Since John is offering the product for $12,000, it's time to cut your losses and move on."
