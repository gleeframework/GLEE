Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $119. I believe it will be highly valuable to you."", 
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's maximum valuation ($120) as possible. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering $119 leaves a small margin in case Bob tries to negotiate down slightly.
* **Secure the Sale:**  While a higher offer is tempting, it risks Bob rejecting the offer and forcing you to accept the $100 offer from John. 
 
This strategy balances risk and reward to maximize the potential profit."
