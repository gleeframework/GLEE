"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. I think it would be a great fit for your needs. I'm asking for $15,000, but I'm open to discussing the price further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's initial offer is significantly higher than both our maximum price and John's offer. There's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product looks great, $15,000 is a bit steep for my budget. I'd be willing to pay $9,000.  Let me know what you think."",
""product_price"": 9000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Start Low:**  We're aiming for a price well below Alice's asking price.  Starting with a low offer gives us room to negotiate upwards.
* **Reasonable Counter:**  While low, $9,000 isn't ridiculously low. It demonstrates we're serious about buying but need a significant price reduction. 
* **Open Communication:**  Maintaining a polite and open tone encourages continued negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is significantly less than what I'm looking for. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000? I'm confident this product will exceed your expectations and provide great value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too High:** $13,000 is closer to her original asking price and still significantly above both our $10,000 limit and John's offer.
* **Room for Negotiation:** Alice's willingness to move down suggests further negotiation is possible.  We haven't reached a point of impasse.
* **Alternative Exists:** We have the safety net of buying from John, so we're not desperate to accept an unfavorable deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find middle ground. I'm willing to increase my offer to $10,000, but that's the absolute highest I can go. It's a fair offer considering market value and my budget."",
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:**  We're now at our maximum budget.  Clearly stating this reinforces that further increases are not an option.
* **Justification:**  Mentioning ""market value"" introduces a reason for Alice to accept, even though we haven't specifically cited competing prices.
* **Firm but Fair:**  The tone remains respectful and avoids an ultimatum. We're giving Alice a chance to accept a price that works for us."
