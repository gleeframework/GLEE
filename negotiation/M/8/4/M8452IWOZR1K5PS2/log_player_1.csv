"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. I think it would be a great fit for your needs. I'm asking for $15,000, but I'm open to discussing the price further."", ""product_price"": 15000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product looks great, $15,000 is a bit steep for my budget. I'd be willing to pay $9,000.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is significantly less than what I'm looking for. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000? I'm confident this product will exceed your expectations and provide great value."", ""product_price"": 13000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find middle ground. I'm willing to increase my offer to $10,000, but that's the absolute highest I can go. It's a fair offer considering market value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** While Bob is getting closer to a reasonable price, it's unlikely he'll go much higher than $10,000. Accepting his offer means losing out on $2,000 compared to John's guaranteed offer. It's strategically better to cut negotiations with Bob and secure the guaranteed profit with John."
