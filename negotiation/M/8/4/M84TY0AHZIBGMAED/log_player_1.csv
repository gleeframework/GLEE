Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product I think you'd be interested in.  It's worth at least $10,000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $11,500.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than your minimum:** You're still getting more than your minimum desired price.
* **It's lower than Bob's perceived value:**  This gives Bob some room to negotiate and feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **It's a clear and concise message:** This makes it easy for Bob to understand your offer. 

By starting with a slightly lower price, you create space for negotiation without sacrificing too much profit. You can then adjust your strategy based on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for offering the product, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Based on my budget, I am able to offer $11,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $11,000 is closer to your minimum acceptable price of $10,000 but still leaves some room for negotiation. You can get a slightly better price by counteroffering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer.  I'm happy to continue negotiating.  While $11,000 is a good price, I'm hoping to get closer to my initial offer of $11,500.  Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $11,250?"", ""product_price"": 11250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. Given my budget constraints, I would like to propose an offer of $11,100 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $11,100 is very close to my initial offer of $11,500. It's still higher than my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.  At this point, continuing to negotiate risks losing Bob as a buyer, and I might end up selling to John for a lower price.  Accepting Bob's offer ensures a good profit while securing the sale."
