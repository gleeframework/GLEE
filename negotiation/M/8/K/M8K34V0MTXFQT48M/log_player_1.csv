"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm starting with a high price of $10,000.  This is a good starting point because:

* **It's above my minimum:**  I want to make as much as possible, and $10,000 is significantly higher than my $8,000 minimum.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  Bob is likely to counteroffer, and this gives us space to negotiate and find a mutually agreeable price.

Let's see what Bob's reaction is.  If he rejects, I'll need to analyze his counteroffer and make a decision about whether to accept or counter-offer again."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to **reject Bob's offer**.  Here's why:

* **It's too low:** While $8,500 is more than my minimum of $8,000, I believe I can still get a better price. 
* **We have time:** We're only in round 2, and I have 8 more rounds to reach a deal. I'm willing to keep negotiating to see if I can secure a higher price.

I'll counteroffer in the next round. I'll need to carefully consider the risks and rewards of lowering my price, but I'm hopeful I can still get a better outcome than $8,500."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

I'm countering with $9,500. Here's my reasoning:

* **Balancing act:**  I want to show Bob I'm willing to negotiate, but I also don't want to give away too much. $9,500 is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer.
* **Testing the waters:** This counteroffer will give me a good sense of how committed Bob is to buying the product. If he's willing to go higher than $8,500, it suggests he values the product more than I initially thought.

I'm still keeping my ""sell to John"" option in mind. If Bob continues to lowball me, I might have to take the guaranteed $8,000 from John.  Let's see what Bob's response is to my counteroffer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to **accept Bob's offer** of $9,200. Here's why:

* **Progress:**  Bob has moved closer to my desired price. While I'd ideally like to get closer to $10,000, this is a significant improvement over the $8,500 he offered earlier.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  We're already in round 4, and it's getting riskier to keep negotiating.  If I keep rejecting, I might end up with a worse offer from Bob, or he could walk away entirely. There's also the risk that John might become unavailable. 
* **Time pressure:**  While we have six rounds left, each round brings us closer to the possibility of having to settle for John's $8,000.

While $9,200 isn't perfect, it's a good compromise that gives me a decent return. I'm confident this is a good deal that will help me maximize my profit."
