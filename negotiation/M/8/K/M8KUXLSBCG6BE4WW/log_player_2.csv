"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is way above your maximum budget of $12,000. It's not worth accepting it. You have better options:

* **Counteroffer:** You can try to negotiate a lower price with Alice.
* **Buy from John:** This is your safest bet, as John's price is within your budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a low counteroffer of $10,000. This is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer and my maximum budget, but it's still a starting point for negotiation. I believe Alice will likely counter with a higher price, giving us room to bargain."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to my budget, it's still higher than what I'm willing to pay. I'll continue to negotiate with Alice in the hopes of getting a better price. I still have the option of buying from John if negotiations with Alice fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer to $11,500. This is a significant increase from my previous offer, showing Alice that I'm serious about buying the product. However, it's still below my maximum budget and leaves room for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above my budget, but I'm getting closer to a deal. I'll continue to negotiate with her and see if I can get the price down further.  I'm still confident that I can get a better price, especially considering that I can always buy from John for $12,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer to $12,500. This is still within my budget, and shows Alice that I'm willing to pay a fair price. However, it's also close to my maximum, so I'm not going to offer any more than this. If Alice doesn't accept, I'll buy from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above my budget. I've already made a counteroffer that was close to my maximum, and she rejected it. I'm running out of time and rounds, and I don't want to risk losing the product altogether. Buying from John at $12,000 is the best option for me, as it guarantees I get the product at a price I'm comfortable with."
