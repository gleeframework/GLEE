Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

I'm starting with an offer of $14,000. This is a price that's higher than my minimum value but leaves room for negotiation. I believe this price will encourage Bob to counteroffer, giving me the opportunity to potentially secure a better price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

``` 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  $10,000 is too low. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I need to get closer to my minimum value of $12,000."

I'm offering $12,500. This is a compromise that's closer to Bob's offer, but still above my minimum value. It demonstrates that I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm also serious about getting a fair price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $11,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not satisfied with the price. I'm going to reject this offer and counteroffer again. I believe I can get a better price with one more attempt."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm offering $11,500. This is a final compromise, meeting Bob halfway between his last offer and my minimum value.  I believe this is a fair price for both of us, and I'm hoping Bob will accept."

I'm going to sell the product to John for $12,000.  Bob has made it clear he's not willing to go higher, and I don't want to continue negotiating.  John is a sure thing, and I'm satisfied with this outcome."
