"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, I think $1,200,000 is a bit high. How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm still looking for a better return on my investment. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. How about we meet at $1,150,000? This is a slight increase from your offer, but I believe it's still a reasonable compromise considering the product's value to you.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  To be frank, $1,150,000 is still a little steep for me.  I'd be willing to go up to $1,050,000. I think that's a fair offer, considering it's a significant jump from my initial counter.",1050000.0,Bob,4,

This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you and my initial asking price.",1125000.0,Alice,5,
