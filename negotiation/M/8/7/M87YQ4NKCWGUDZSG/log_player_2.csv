{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $9,000 is a better price than $12,000, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $9,500 is still a better price than $12,000, Alice is increasing the price.  It's worth one more round of negotiation to see if Bob can push for a better price. There's still potential to get it closer to his target price of $8,500."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice is now offering a price of $9,800, which is getting closer to Bob's maximum budget of $12,000. However, there is little room for further negotiation at this point. Considering that Bob has already rejected several offers and made counteroffers, it's likely that Alice is unwilling to go lower.  To avoid further haggling and ensure he gets the product, Bob should choose to buy from John for $12,000."
