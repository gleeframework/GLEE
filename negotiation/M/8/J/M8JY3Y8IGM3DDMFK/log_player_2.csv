"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this great product, and I think you'll really like it! I'm willing to let it go for $150. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

Alice's offer is much higher than your maximum price and what John is offering. It makes the most sense to buy from John for $80."
