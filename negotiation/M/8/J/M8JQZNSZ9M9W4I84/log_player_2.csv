"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the product at a price of $1,000,000. This is a great opportunity to acquire a valuable asset at a price that's significantly lower than its true worth to me.  While I'm confident I can sell it to another buyer for a higher price, I'm open to negotiating with you first. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
