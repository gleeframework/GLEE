"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

I'm starting with an offer of $1,400,000. This is a good starting point, leaving some room for negotiation while still being significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price. I want to see if Bob is willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $1,300,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still aiming for a higher profit. I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can get him to budge closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,350,000. This is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway between his offer and my previous offer. I'm hoping this will be a sweet spot for him to accept, but I'm prepared to continue negotiating if necessary."
