Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and respect your valuation of the product. In light of that, I am willing to consider a price of $9000 for the product. This is a compromise between our previous offers and I hope it will be acceptable to you.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $9,000 is closer to Bob's preferred price, there's still room for negotiation.  It's worth exploring if Alice will come down further before considering buying from John."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your prompt response, Bob. I appreciate your effort to find a mutually agreeable price. Considering the value of the product and your willingness to negotiate, I am willing to accept $8875 for the product. I believe this price reflects a fair compromise for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,875. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,875

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's final offer of $8,875 is very close to Bob's last counteroffer of $8,750.  At this point, it's more beneficial for Bob to accept the offer and save $1,125 compared to buying from John.  Further negotiation is unlikely to result in a significantly lower price."
