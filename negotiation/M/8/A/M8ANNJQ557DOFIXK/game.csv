"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $500000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your offer. While I value your perspective,  $500000 is significantly below what this product is worth. Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to consider $700000. This price reflects the product's unique qualities and ensures a mutually beneficial transaction.  What do you think?",700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but I still think $700000 is a bit high. I'd be willing to meet you halfway, so how about $600000?",600000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to find a price that works for both of us, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $600000 still falls short of the product's true value.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $650000. This price is fair and allows us to finalize this transaction. What do you say?",650000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $650000. How about we meet at $620000? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget.",620000.0,Bob,6,
