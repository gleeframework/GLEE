"Bob, thanks for your interest. While I appreciate your offer,  $14,000 is really my firm starting point. I could potentially consider a smaller discount, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000.  Would you be willing to meet me somewhere in the middle?",12500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand that you're not willing to go as low as $10,000, but I'm still looking to save some money. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $10,000 and $12,500, which would be $11,250. Can you consider this offer?",11250.0,Bob,4,
