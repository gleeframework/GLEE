"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $10,000 is better than $12,000, Bob can still potentially get a better deal by continuing to negotiate with Alice.  He has 9 more rounds to try and get closer to his $8,000 target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a price close to his maximum budget of $8,000. Offering $8,500 is a significant drop from Alice's initial offer and shows Bob's seriousness in negotiating. This gives Alice room to negotiate while still allowing Bob to save a considerable amount of money."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $9,500 is closer to Bob's target, he still has the option to potentially get the product for even less by continuing the negotiation. Bob wants to try and push Alice further towards his $8,500 counteroffer or even lower before resorting to buying from John.  There are 7 rounds left for him to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to meet Alice halfway. He's increased his offer from $8,500 to $9,000, showing his willingness to compromise. This is a reasonable counteroffer, especially considering there are six rounds remaining.  Bob is aiming for a deal that benefits both parties and allows him to save a significant amount compared to Alice's initial offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's target price, but he still has several rounds left.  He's only $750 away from his $9,000 counteroffer, and it's worth attempting to negotiate further. There is a chance that Alice might be willing to concede to a price closer to Bob's desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9250} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is taking a calculated risk by increasing his counteroffer slightly to $9,250.  He's trying to close the gap with Alice's offer while still remaining within his budget. With only four rounds left, he's willing to test the waters and see if Alice will concede."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $9,500 is still higher than Bob's desired price.  With only three rounds remaining, the chances of getting a better deal are slim.  Additionally, Bob has a reliable alternative with John who's offering the product for $8,000. It's time to secure the product at a price that meets Bob's budget.  While he might be able to get a slightly better price with Alice, the risk of not reaching an agreement within the remaining rounds is too high."
