"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,050,000. It's a unique opportunity for you to acquire something worth $1,000,000 to you. Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,050,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to offer you $700,000 for the product.  I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $700,000 is far below the product's true value. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to see a higher offer. How about $900,000? This is still a significant discount for you, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand that you're looking for a fair price. While $900,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm aiming for a price closer to $800,000. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $850,000?",850000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $850,000 is closer to my desired price point, I'm still a bit hesitant.  Let's meet in the middle.  How about $875,000?  It's a fair compromise for both of us.",875000.0,Alice,5,
