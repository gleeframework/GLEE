"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $100 is a bit too steep for me. Would you consider $60? I think that's a fair price.",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $60 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $85, which is still a good deal for both of us. What do you think?",85.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a fair price, Alice. How about $75? That's a significant increase from my last offer and would allow us to close the deal.",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest. $75 is still a little low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $80? This would be a good compromise, and we could finalize the deal.",80.0,Alice,5,
