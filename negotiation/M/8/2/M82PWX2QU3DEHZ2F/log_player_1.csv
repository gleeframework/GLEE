Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly.  Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $16,000.  I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and the benefit it will bring you."", 
""product_price"": 16000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This provides room for negotiation and allows Bob to feel like he's getting a deal if he counters.
* **Justification:**  Simply throwing out a number might be off-putting. By mentioning the product's value and potential benefits to Bob, we're providing context for the price.
* **Urgency (Subtle):** By mentioning listing it publicly, we're subtly creating a sense of urgency, potentially motivating Bob to act quicker.
* **Backup Plan:** We know John will buy the product for $12,000, so we don't need to go below that price.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Personality:** If we knew Bob was very price-sensitive, we might start lower. But without that information, a higher starting point is strategically sound. 
* **Negotiation Skills:** This is just the opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters."
