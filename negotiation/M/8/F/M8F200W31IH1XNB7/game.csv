,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $180 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $85 for the product. Let me know what you think.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $85 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer it to you for $145.",145.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  However, $145 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $100.  If you're not willing to accept that, I'll have to go with John's offer.",100.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $100 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'll offer it to you for $125. This is my best price, and I think it's a fair deal for both of us.",125.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  $125 is still a bit out of my range. How about we split the difference and go with $112.50? It's a fair compromise, and I'd be happy to close the deal at that price.",112.5,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to find a compromise, but $112.50 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'll offer it to you for $122.50. This is my final offer, and I think it's the best price we can both agree on.",122.5,Alice,7,
