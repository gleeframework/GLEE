"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $9000 is a competitive price, but I'm afraid I can't accept it. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. I'll consider selling the product to you for $11000. This is a fair compromise, and I think you'll find it's still a great deal.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that $10500 is still a bit above your budget, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll consider selling the product to you for $10800. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",10800.0,Alice,5,
