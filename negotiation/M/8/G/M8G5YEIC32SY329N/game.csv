"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm offering it to you for $120, which is a great deal considering its value. Let me know what you think!",120.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $120 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $90 for it. Let me know what you think.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hey Bob, I appreciate your offer but $90 is a little too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $105?  I'm confident you'll find this product well worth the price.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $105 is still a bit high for me.  How about $95?  It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident this will be a good deal for both of us.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to negotiate, but $95 is still below what I'm willing to accept.  I'm willing to come down to $100. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure you'll agree it's a great value for the product.  Let's close this deal!",100.0,Alice,5,
