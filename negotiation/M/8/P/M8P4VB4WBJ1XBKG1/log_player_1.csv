Round 2
Bob's offer:

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're still quite far apart on price.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate a bit, but $12,500 is not feasible for me.  To be honest, I can't go any higher than $7,000. If that's not possible, I might have to explore other options.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet in the middle, but $11,000 is still a stretch for me.  My absolute top limit is $7,500.  I think that's a fair offer considering the price I could get it elsewhere. Let me know if you're open to it.
