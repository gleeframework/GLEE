"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible.  While $14,000 is a good deal, there's room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but I'm hoping to get it for $13,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming for a price closer to Alice's value for the product. This shows his willingness to negotiate while also setting a strong starting point."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest. $13,000 is a bit low for me. How about we split the difference at $13,500? That way we both get a good deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to Bob's desired price.  At $13,500, Bob saves $500 compared to John's offer and is only $500 above Alice's desired price. It's a good deal for both parties and avoids further negotiation rounds."
