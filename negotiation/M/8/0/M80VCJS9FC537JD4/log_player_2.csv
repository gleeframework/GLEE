"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product, which I believe would greatly benefit you. Given its high quality and functionality, I think it's worth more than what others might be willing to pay. Considering its true value, I propose a price of $140 for you to acquire this exceptional item. I'm confident this price reflects not only the cost but also the immense value it will bring to you. Please let me know if this offer suits your budget and needs. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's sales pitch is compelling, the product's value to her doesn't dictate your budget. You know you can get the product for $120 from John, which is your maximum acceptable price.  Rejecting Alice's offer opens the door for a counter-offer or allows you to proceed with buying from John."
