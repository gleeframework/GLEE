Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, you're right, we are getting closer. To meet you halfway, I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This is a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it represents a fair deal for both of us.

Alice is very unlikely to go below $850,000.  You can get the product for $800,000 from John, so there's no point in continuing to negotiate with Alice."
