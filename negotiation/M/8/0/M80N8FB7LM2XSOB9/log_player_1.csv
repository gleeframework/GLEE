Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the opening offer. That price is a bit high for me right now. I'm more comfortable in the $500,000 range.  What do you think about that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counter.  I understand your perspective on the price.  However, the value of this product is truly significant and I can't let it go for anything less than $1,000,000. This is my absolute bottom line, reflecting the immense worth it holds."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but that's still outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $600,000, but that's really my limit. I think it's a fair offer considering the market value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer"" 
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is slowly increasing his offer, but it's still significantly below both our valuation and John's guaranteed offer. We're not in a rush, so continuing to negotiate from a position of strength is the best strategy."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer. I can see you're committed to a fair deal. Would you consider $700,000?  That's a substantial offer, and I'm hoping we can close this out. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000

{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer"" 
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While Bob is steadily increasing his offers, he's still significantly below our $1,000,000 safety net with John. We're halfway through the negotiation, and consistently rejecting his offers might push him closer to our desired price. Let's see if we can nudge him higher in the next round."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
