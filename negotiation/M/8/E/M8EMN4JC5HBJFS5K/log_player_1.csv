"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $100.  This is a reasonable starting point, as it's above my minimum value of $80, but hopefully leaves room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $80 is my minimum, I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price of $100. There are still rounds left for negotiation, so I'll try to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $90. This is still a bit higher than his offer but is a significant decrease from my original asking price, showing that I'm willing to negotiate."
