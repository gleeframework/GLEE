Alice's offer:

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're really interested in the product, Bob, and I appreciate your enthusiasm. However, I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to get at least $1,050,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the potential return on investment. Let's meet in the middle! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.

It's unlikely Alice will go much lower than $1,050,000.  At this point, cutting my losses and buying from John for $1,000,000 makes the most financial sense."
