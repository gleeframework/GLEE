"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!",11500.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,000. I really like the product, but I'm on a tight budget. Can we meet in the middle at $10,500?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $10,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to make a profit. How about we meet in the middle at $10,750? It's still a great deal for you, as the product is worth $12,000 to you. Let's make this happen!",10750.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,750 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $10,250?",10250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $10,250 is still too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $10,500, which is a fair compromise considering the value of the product to you. Let's make a deal and both of us be happy!",10500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to make a deal, but $10,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $10,250, but I'm not sure I can go any higher. Can you meet me at $10,250?",10250.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I hear you, but $10,250 just doesn't work for me. How about we split the difference one last time and settle for $10,375? That's a fair price for both of us, considering the product's value to you. Let's finalize this and move on.",10375.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but $10,375 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $10,000, which is my absolute maximum. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'll have to consider other options.",10000.0,Bob,8,
