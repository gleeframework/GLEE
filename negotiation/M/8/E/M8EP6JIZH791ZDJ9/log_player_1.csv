Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,000. I really like the product, but I'm on a tight budget. Can we meet in the middle at $10,500?

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still significantly lower than my minimum desired price of $10,000. I have 9 rounds left to negotiate with Bob, and I'm hoping to get closer to my desired price."

Round 4

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I hear you, but $10,250 just doesn't work for me. How about we split the difference one last time and settle for $10,375? That's a fair price for both of us, considering the product's value to you. Let's finalize this and move on."", ""product_price"": 10375}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but $10,375 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $10,000, which is my absolute maximum. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'll have to consider other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob has reached his limit and won't budge further. With only 2 rounds left, it's not worth the risk of rejecting his offer and potentially ending up with nothing.  Selling to John for $10,000 guarantees me a sale and avoids the possibility of a failed negotiation."
