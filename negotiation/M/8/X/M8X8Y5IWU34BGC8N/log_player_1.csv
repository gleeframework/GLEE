Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. It's a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$950,000:** This price is a good starting point. It's higher than what Bob is willing to pay but lower than what the product is worth to me. 
* **Message:** The message is friendly and encourages Bob to consider the offer. It emphasizes the value of the product.

**Reasoning:**

This offer provides me with some wiggle room for negotiation. It's likely Bob will counteroffer at a lower price. If he rejects, I have the option to counter with a slightly lower price, or I can walk away and sell to John for $1,000,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your confidence in the product's value, but I'm looking to save some money. I'm willing to pay $850000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $850,000 is a decent offer, it's still significantly lower than what I believe the product is worth. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob. 

**Reasoning:**

I have a few reasons for rejecting Bob's offer:

* **Higher Value:** I still have the option to sell to John for $1,000,000, so I'm not desperate to accept Bob's offer.
* **Negotiation Leverage:**  By rejecting, I maintain control of the negotiation. I can counteroffer and potentially get closer to my desired price.
* **Potential for Better Deal:**  There's a chance that by negotiating further, I can convince Bob to pay closer to my initial offer of $950,000. 

I'm confident that I can secure a better deal with Bob or, if necessary, fall back on John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking to save some money, and I appreciate your offer.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $900,000. This is still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. Let's meet in the middle on this one."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$900,000:** This price is a compromise that meets halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer.  It shows a willingness to negotiate while still maintaining a respectable price.
* **Message:** The message acknowledges Bob's desire to save money and reinforces the value of the product. It also encourages Bob to accept the counteroffer. 

**Reasoning:**

* **Flexibility:** This counteroffer shows Bob that I'm flexible and willing to negotiate.
* **Fair Compromise:** $900,000 is a fair compromise that's a better deal for me than Bob's offer but still attractive to Bob.
* **Increased Chances of Agreement:**  By showing flexibility, I increase the likelihood that Bob will accept this counteroffer, potentially saving me the time and effort of further negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $825000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

While I am willing to negotiate, Bob's offer of $825,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm not willing to drop the price any further, and I'm confident that I can get a better price from John.

**Reasoning:**

* **John's Offer:**  I have a guaranteed buyer in John who is willing to pay $1,000,000. There's no need to risk further negotiation with Bob and potentially lose a significant amount of money.
* **Low Value:**  Bob's offer is closer to the minimum value I'm willing to accept for the product, which is $1,000,000.  
* **Time and Effort:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob could take more time and effort without a guarantee of a better outcome. Selling to John provides a quicker and more secure solution.

By selling to John, I can maximize my profits and avoid further negotiations that could result in a less favorable outcome."
