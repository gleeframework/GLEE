"Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $1400000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to compromise, though. How about we meet in the middle at $1600000? This still leaves room for profit for both of us. Let me know what you think.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1600000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers, so I'm offering $1550000. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial price.",1550000.0,Bob,4,
