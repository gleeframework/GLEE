Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** $10,000 is more than your minimum of $8,000.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  There's a $2,000 difference between your offer and Bob's perceived value, allowing for potential negotiation.
* **It shows you're serious:**  You're not starting too low, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate but also a confidence in the product's worth."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,000. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer meets your minimum, it's still significantly lower than the $10,000 you initially proposed.  You want to see if you can get closer to that initial price.  Rejecting his offer allows you to counter and potentially secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you're looking for a good price. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer, but $8,000 is just too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $9,000? That way, we both get a fair deal."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit above my budget, so I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $8,500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** Bob's offer is $500 more than your minimum and only $500 less than your last counteroffer.  This signifies a good chance of reaching an agreement.
* **Time is money:**  While a higher price would be ideal, continuing to negotiate risks losing Bob entirely. Accepting his offer ensures a sale and a profit.
* **John's offer:**  While John is a backup, his offer is only $500 less than what Bob is proposing, making Bob's offer a more attractive option at this point."
