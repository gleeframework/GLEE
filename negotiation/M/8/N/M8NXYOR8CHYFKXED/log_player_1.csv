"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
```

I'm starting with a high price, $20,000, to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium. This gives me room to negotiate downwards if needed, and also allows me to quickly assess his interest level."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $15,000 is my minimum acceptable price, I'm not willing to settle for it right away.  Bob's initial counteroffer is too low, and I believe I can do better. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round to try and secure a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
```

I'm offering $18,000 as a counteroffer. This is a significant increase from Bob's initial offer, but still below my initial asking price. I hope this will encourage Bob to meet me halfway, as I'm willing to negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $16,000 is getting closer to my desired price. While it would be nice to squeeze out another couple thousand, I'm concerned that continuing to negotiate could risk losing the deal altogether.  It's better to secure a solid profit now than risk getting stuck with my minimum price from John."
