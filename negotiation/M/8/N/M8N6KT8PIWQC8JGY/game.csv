"Bob, thanks for your offer. I appreciate you acknowledging the value of the product.  While $10000 is my minimum,  I'm willing to come down a bit to $12500 to make this work. This still allows me to recover some of the value, and I believe it's a fair price for the benefits you'll get from the product.",12500.0,Alice,3,
