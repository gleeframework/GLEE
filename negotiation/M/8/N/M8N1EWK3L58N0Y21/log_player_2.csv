"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic product that I think you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $120. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price elsewhere. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

``` 

Alice's offer is well below your maximum budget of $150, making it a good deal. There's no reason to risk further negotiation or paying more to John."
