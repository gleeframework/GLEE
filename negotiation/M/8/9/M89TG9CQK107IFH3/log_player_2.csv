"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you this valuable product at a price of $1,000,000. It's a significant opportunity for you, and I believe it's a fair price considering its value to you. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high for Bob. He can get a better deal by negotiating further. Buying from John at $1,200,000 is worse than negotiating with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $700,000. It's a significant discount, but still a fair price given the value of the product to me. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 700000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but reasonable:** This counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's initial price but still allows for some negotiation space. 
* **Highlighting value:** Bob emphasizes the product's value to him, making his offer seem more reasonable. 
* **Positive tone:**  The message maintains a positive and respectful tone to encourage continued negotiations."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $700,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $900,000 is the absolute minimum I can accept. This still leaves you with a substantial profit, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is still asking for too much.**  Even with the reduction to $900,000, it's still above Bob's desired price point.
* **There's room for further negotiation.**  Bob can likely get a better price by continuing the negotiation process.
* **Buying from John is still a worse option.** The price from John is significantly higher than Alice's offer, making it a less desirable option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $900,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $850,000? It's a fair compromise and allows me to get the product while still staying within my budget."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving closer to Alice's price:** Bob is showing good faith by raising his offer but staying within his budget.
* **Emphasizing compromise:** Bob positions his offer as a fair compromise, appealing to Alice's sense of reason.
* **Maintaining a positive tone:**  The message remains friendly and respectful, fostering a positive negotiating environment."
