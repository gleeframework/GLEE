"Bob, I'm offering you this valuable product at a price of $1,000,000. It's a significant opportunity for you, and I believe it's a fair price considering its value to you. What do you say?",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $700,000. It's a significant discount, but still a fair price given the value of the product to me. What do you think?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $700,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $900,000 is the absolute minimum I can accept. This still leaves you with a substantial profit, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $900,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $850,000? It's a fair compromise and allows me to get the product while still staying within my budget.",850000.0,Bob,4,
