{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you this valuable product at a price of $1,000,000. It's a significant opportunity for you, and I believe it's a fair price considering its value to you. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $700,000. It's a significant discount, but still a fair price given the value of the product to me. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's too low. While I want to close the deal, I'm not willing to sell for less than $800,000.  I'll see if I can negotiate a better price with Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $700,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $900,000 is the absolute minimum I can accept. This still leaves you with a substantial profit, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $900,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $850,000? It's a fair compromise and allows me to get the product while still staying within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  While I'd prefer a higher price, $850,000 is a good deal for me. It's above my minimum requirement of $800,000 and represents a strong profit for me."
