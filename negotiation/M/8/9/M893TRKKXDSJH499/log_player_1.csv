{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While I'm still slightly below my initial goal,  $1,116,875 is a fair price considering the negotiations and the potential risk of not selling to Bob. It's better than selling to John for $1,200,000 and potentially losing out on a higher offer from Bob in the future."
