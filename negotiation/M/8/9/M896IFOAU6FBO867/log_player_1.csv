Send your offer to Bob.","```json

I'm starting with a high offer of $15,000. This is a good starting point because:

* **It's above my minimum value:** I'm comfortable selling for at least $10,000, so this leaves room for negotiation.
* **It sets a high expectation:**  Bob will know from the outset that I value the product highly.

I'm curious to see how Bob responds. If he rejects, I'll need to adjust my strategy based on his counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my desired price, and even below my minimum value of $10,000. I'm not willing to accept this. 

I will proceed to round 3 and make a counteroffer to see if we can reach a more reasonable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm reducing my offer to $12,000. This is a compromise from my initial $15,000 offer, but still significantly higher than Bob's $7,000 counteroffer.  I believe this is a fair price, considering the value of the product to me.

This counteroffer allows room for further negotiation if necessary, while still ensuring I get a price closer to my desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer of $9,000 is getting closer to my minimum value of $10,000, it's still not quite there. I'm going to reject this offer and see if I can push for a higher price in the next round. 

I'm also considering selling to John at this point, as $10,000 is a guaranteed sale. However, I believe there's still potential to get a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

I'm offering $10,500. This is a further compromise from my previous offer, and it's just above my minimum value of $10,000. 

This offer is a clear signal to Bob that I'm serious about selling the product to him, but I'm not willing to go any lower. I'm hoping he recognizes the value of the product and accepts this offer. If he doesn't, I'll have to seriously consider selling to John for the guaranteed $10,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $9,500 is still below my minimum value.  While I'd prefer to sell to Bob for a higher price, the risk of continuing to negotiate is too high at this point.

With only four rounds left, there's a good chance we won't reach an agreement. I'm also starting to feel like Bob is not truly interested in paying a fair price for the product.

Selling to John for $10,000 is a guaranteed sale and ensures I get my minimum value. It's the safest and most practical decision at this point."
