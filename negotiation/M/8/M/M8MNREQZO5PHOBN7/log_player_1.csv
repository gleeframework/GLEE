"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. It's a unique opportunity, and I believe it's worth $850,000 to you.  Let's start the conversation there."", ""product_price"": 850000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's estimated value to leave room for negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:** A friendly and optimistic message helps build rapport and encourages Bob to engage.
* **Justification:** I'm giving Bob a reason to consider my offer (unique opportunity, value to him)."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product is important to both of us. I would like to propose a price of $750,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** While I understand the importance of reaching an agreement, Bob's offer is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. 
* **Negotiation Opportunity:** I'm willing to continue the negotiation process, hoping to reach a mutually agreeable price.
* **Keeping Options Open:**  While selling to John for $800,000 is an option, I'd prefer to maximize my potential earnings if possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I acknowledge your perspective, $750,000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  I'm willing to come down to $825,000. This price is fair and allows us both to benefit from this deal."", ""product_price"": 825000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm demonstrating a willingness to compromise by lowering my price from $850,000 to $825,000.
* **Fairness Emphasis:** I'm highlighting the ""fairness"" of the price to appeal to Bob's sense of equity.
* **Benefit Focus:**  I'm framing the price as a mutually beneficial solution for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. After considering the value of the product and our previous discussions, I would like to propose a price of $780,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $780,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $780,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:**  Bob's offer of $780,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $800,000.  While it's closer, I'm not yet willing to accept a loss on the product.
* **Limited Rounds:** We have limited rounds left (6 rounds). If I reject this offer, I can make a counteroffer and potentially close the deal at a higher price.
* **John's Offer:** While I could sell to John for $800,000, I'm still hopeful that I can secure a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  your offer is getting closer. I value your continued interest. To reach an agreement, I'm willing to come down to $805,000. This is a small step for both of us, and it allows us to finalize the deal."", ""product_price"": 805000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** I'm dropping my price to just above my minimum acceptable price, showing a significant willingness to compromise. 
* **Emphasis on Finality:**  I'm emphasizing the ""final"" nature of this offer to encourage Bob to accept and avoid further negotiation.
* **Mutual Benefit:**  I'm again highlighting the ""small step"" for both of us to imply a fair and agreeable outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your efforts in negotiating, Alice. After careful consideration, I would like to propose a final price of $795,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $795,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $795,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is Running Out:**  We have only four rounds left. It's becoming increasingly likely that we won't be able to agree on a price.
* **Close but Not Enough:**  Bob's offer of $795,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $800,000.  While it's very close, I'm not willing to accept a loss.
* **John's Offer is Secure:** I know I can sell to John for $800,000, which guarantees me my minimum desired amount.  

Given the limited time and the risk of a failed negotiation, selling to John is the most sensible choice to secure the best possible outcome in this situation."
