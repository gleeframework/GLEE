Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000,  given the value of this product. Let's find a middle ground.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,000,000 is still below my minimum. Let's compromise at $1,300,000. This is a fair price considering the value you'll receive. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has consistently rejected offers at or below Bob's $1,000,000 maximum.  Her latest counteroffer of $1,300,000 shows she's unlikely to move significantly closer to Bob's acceptable price.  It's in Bob's best interest to cut negotiations short and secure the product from John at his guaranteed price."
