"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000,  given the value of this product. Let's find a middle ground.",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,000,000 is still below my minimum. Let's compromise at $1,300,000. This is a fair price considering the value you'll receive. What do you say?",1300000.0,Alice,5,
