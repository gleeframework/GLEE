"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd really appreciate. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to let it go for a fair price. How does $140 sound to you? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, you can still do better. You are willing to pay up to $150, and Alice's offer is $140. This means there is room for negotiation. By rejecting her offer, you can potentially push her down to a lower price."
