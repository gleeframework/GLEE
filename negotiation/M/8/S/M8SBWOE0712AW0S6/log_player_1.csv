Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

This offer gives Bob a $100,000 discount, which is a good incentive for him to buy. At the same time, it ensures I still earn $400,000 more than I would by selling to John. This is a strategic approach that balances maximizing my profit with increasing the likelihood of Bob accepting the offer."
