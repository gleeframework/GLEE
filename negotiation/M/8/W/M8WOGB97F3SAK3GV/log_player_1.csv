Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I think it would be incredibly valuable for your business.  Given its potential, I'm offering it to you for $2,200,000."", ""product_price"": 2200000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting significantly higher than Bob's perceived value but below my minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and creates the impression the product might be worth even more than $800,000 to Bob. 
* **Justification:** I'm not just throwing out a number. Mentioning the ""value for his business"" subtly implies there's a strategic advantage he might be overlooking, justifying the high price.
* **Leaving Room for John:**  While I want to negotiate with Bob, I always have the option of selling to John for my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm very interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe it's a great product, but I'm on a tight budget and need to be mindful of our company's expenses. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly below my minimum acceptable price. While he expressed interest, I'm confident I can negotiate a better deal. Selling to John is a guaranteed profit but I believe I can get closer to my target price with a well-placed counter-offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate your interest, Bob, and understand you're working within a budget. However, $1,200,000 significantly undervalues the product's potential impact on your business. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000."",
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledging Budget:** I want to show Bob I'm listening and willing to negotiate, building rapport for a better deal.
* **Reiterating Value:** By emphasizing the ""potential impact"" again, I'm subtly pushing back against his lowball offer, reminding him of the benefits he might miss.
* **Significant Drop, But Above Minimum:**  The $300,000 reduction seems large, making me look more flexible.  However, I'm still well above both his offer and my absolute bottom line. 
* **Pressure:** By staying closer to my initial price, I'm subtly communicating I'm serious about the value and he might need to stretch his budget further to secure the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still a bit above my budget with the new offer. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $1,500,000. I'm really interested in this product, but I need to be able to justify the cost to my team and stakeholders. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has met my absolute minimum acceptable price. While I could try to push for more, it's unlikely he'll go much higher. Accepting now guarantees the sale and avoids the risk of losing him entirely by pushing too hard."
