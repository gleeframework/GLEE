"I appreciate your interest, Bob, and understand you're working within a budget. However, $1,200,000 significantly undervalues the product's potential impact on your business. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000.",1900000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still a bit above my budget with the new offer. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $1,500,000. I'm really interested in this product, but I need to be able to justify the cost to my team and stakeholders.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
