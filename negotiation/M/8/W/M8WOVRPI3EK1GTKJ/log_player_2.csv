"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's a unique opportunity to get something truly valuable. I believe it's worth more than what others might offer, but I'm open to discussing a fair price. Let's start with my offer of $120 for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is too high. It's better to negotiate and see if she's willing to come down closer to my budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product looks valuable, $120 is a bit outside my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price closer to $60?"",
""product_price"": 60
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** I'm starting with a low counteroffer ($60) to give myself room to negotiate upwards.  
* **Polite and Reasonable:** I want to maintain a good negotiating relationship with Alice. I'm acknowledging the product's value while being clear about my budget limitations."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and would like to make a counteroffer. Considering the value of the product and your budget, how about we meet in the middle at $90? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $90 is closer to my budget, it's still above what I'm willing to pay. I'll counteroffer again and see if Alice is open to going lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  $90 is closer, but I'm aiming for something closer to $70. Would that be feasible?"",
""product_price"": 70
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Increases:** I'm increasing my offer incrementally to show Alice I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm still aiming to stay well below her current offer.
* **Clear Target:**  By stating my desired price range, I'm giving Alice a concrete target to consider. 
* **Maintaining Communication:** I want to keep the conversation going and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
