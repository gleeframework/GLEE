"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product.  Given its potential, I believe a starting price of $1,300,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",1300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,000,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,000,000 is significantly below what I believe the product is worth. I'm willing to negotiate, so how about we meet in the middle at $1,175,000?",1175000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still not convinced that $1,175,000 is a fair price. I'm willing to meet you at $1,050,000, which is closer to my target price. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best possible price, and I respect that.  To show I'm flexible, I'm willing to come down to $1,125,000.  This is a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it represents a fair deal for both of us.",1125000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still a bit far from my target price. I'm willing to meet you at $1,075,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1075000.0,Bob,6,
