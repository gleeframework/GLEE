"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product. I believe it holds immense value, and I'm confident it can greatly benefit you. I'm initially proposing a price of $2,000,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts?",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you see in the product. However, my budget allows me to pay no more than $1,200,000 for the product. I would like to propose a price of $1,200,000 if possible.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,200,000 is significantly below what I can accept. This product has exceptional potential and I've had considerable interest from other parties.  Would you consider $1,800,000?  I'm confident this price reflects the true value of what's being offered.",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, Alice. While I respect the value you see in the product, my maximum budget remains $1,200,000. I am unable to increase my offer beyond this amount. Could we possibly find a middle ground?",1200000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence.  Let's find a way to make this work.  How about we meet halfway at $1,500,000?  This reflects a significant compromise on my end but shows my commitment to getting this deal done with you.",1500000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. Given our previous discussions, I would like to propose a price of $1,400,000. This still represents a significant savings for me compared to your initial offer, while acknowledging the value you see in the product.",1400000.0,Bob,6,
