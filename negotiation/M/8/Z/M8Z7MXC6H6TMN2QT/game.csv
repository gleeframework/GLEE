"Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer! I'm interested in the product but $9,000 is a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $7,500.  Let me know what you think.",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $8,250?  That's still a good price for you, and it gives me a bit more for my investment. Let me know what you think.",8250.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $8,250 is still a bit out of my price range. I'm happy to meet you in the middle at $8,000. This would give us both a fair deal. Let's make this happen!",8000.0,Bob,4,
