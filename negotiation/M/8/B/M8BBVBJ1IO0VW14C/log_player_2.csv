"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below its true value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above your ideal price point.  You have room to negotiate and potentially get a better deal. It's worth exploring counteroffers to see if you can lower the price further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $9,500 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $8,500, which is still a fair price considering the product's value to me. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant step down from Alice's initial offer, but it's still above Alice's desired price point.  This allows for room for further negotiation while demonstrating your willingness to compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer.  How about $9,000? It's still a great price considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to your desired price point, but $9,000 is still higher than your target.  You have room to negotiate further and attempt to get a price closer to your ideal $8,500. It's worth exploring counteroffers before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $9,000 is still a bit high for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $8,750?  This price reflects the value of the product to both of us and would allow us to close the deal."", ""product_price"": 8750}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a compromise between Alice's latest offer and your previous offer. It's a strong middle ground that demonstrates your desire to reach an agreement while still staying within your budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $8,750 is still below my minimum.  Let's split the difference. How about $8,875?  That's a fair price for both of us and will let us finalize this deal.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,875. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,875
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $8,875, which is only $375 above your ideal price of $8,500. This is a good deal for you, especially considering you only have 5 rounds left and the alternative is buying from John for $10,000.  It's unlikely you'll get much closer to your ideal price in the remaining rounds, so accepting is the best option at this point."
