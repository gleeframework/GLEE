"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $110 is within Bob's budget, it's not the best deal.  There's room for negotiation to get a lower price.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 95}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is aiming to save as much money as possible.  Offering $95 is a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer, but still leaves room for Alice to make a profit.  This counteroffer starts the negotiation process and shows Bob is serious about getting a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's counteroffer of $105 is within Bob's budget and represents a significant improvement from her initial offer of $110. While Bob could continue to negotiate, there's a risk that Alice might become less willing to compromise, or Bob could run out of rounds. Accepting the offer at $105 ensures a successful purchase at a reasonable price, saving Bob money compared to buying from John."
