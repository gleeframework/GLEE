"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $12000? I think that's a fair price for this product, and I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchasing it if we can come to an agreement.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer of $12000. I appreciate your interest in the product, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. However, I still need to make a profit, so I'm willing to offer it to you for $14000. Let me know if this is more in line with what you're looking for.",14000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer of $14000. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit short on budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $13500? I'm really interested in the product, and I think this price would be a fair compromise.",13500.0,Bob,4,
