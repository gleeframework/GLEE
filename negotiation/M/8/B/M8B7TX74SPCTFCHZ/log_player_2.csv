"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000, which is the minimum price I'm willing to accept. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

Alice is clearly stating her minimum acceptable price is $1,200,000.  Since you can buy it for the same price from John, there's no benefit to accepting Alice's offer. You might as well go directly to John."
