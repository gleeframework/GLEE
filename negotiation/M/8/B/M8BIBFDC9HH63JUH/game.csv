"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to lower the price to $11,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the effort I've put into preparing it. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $11,000 is still above my limit. I'm willing to go up to $10,000 for the product.  If that works for you, I'm ready to finalize the purchase.  If not, I'll have to consider my other options.",10000.0,Bob,4,
