"Alice, $150 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $90 for the product. Let's see if we can work something out.",90.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $120? It's a fair price for a product you'll love.",120.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $120 is still a bit high for me.  I'm happy to pay $105.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close the deal.",105.0,Bob,4,
