"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I appreciate you reaching out.  While I think this product sounds great, $120 is a bit out of my budget.  I'd be willing to pay $90 for it.  What do you think?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $120 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm still really interested in selling this product to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $110. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really love the product!",110.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $110 is still a little high for me.  I'm really serious about buying this product, so how about we split the difference and I pay you $105?  That would be a fair compromise for both of us.",105.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're really interested in buying this product, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not willing to go below $110. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, though, and offer it to you for $107.50. It's a small step closer to your offer, and I think it's a fair price for the value this product brings.",107.5,Alice,5,
