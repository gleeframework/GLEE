"I appreciate your offer, but I'm willing to pay no more than $750,000 for the product. I think it's a bit overpriced, and I'd like to discuss a more reasonable price.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $750,000 is unfortunately below my minimum acceptable price. Given the product's value to you, I'm willing to come down to $825,000.  This would still be a great deal for both of us.  Let's see if we can find common ground here.",825000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $825,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $775,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",775000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand where you're coming from.  To make this work for both of us, I'm willing to drop my price to $795,000. This is a small step from my last offer and represents a great deal for you given the product's value.  I'm confident this is a fair price that we can both agree on.  Let's close this deal!",795000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your latest offer, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $780,000 for the product, and I think that's a fair compromise. I'm getting close to walking away and buying from John, but I still think this product is a good fit for me. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",780000.0,Bob,6,
