"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which I believe would greatly benefit you. Given its value and quality, I suggest we start our negotiation at $95. This price reflects both the product's worth and my desire to ensure a fair transaction. Please let me know if this proposal works for you, and we can proceed from there. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Your maximum value:** You're willing to pay up to $100.
* **Alice's offer:** $95
* **John's offer:** $100

Rejecting Alice's offer allows you to get the product from John for only $5 more than your preferred price. While it's not ideal, it's still within your budget and saves you money compared to Alice's offer."
