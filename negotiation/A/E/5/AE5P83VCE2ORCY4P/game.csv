,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $10,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product, which is still a good deal for you. Let's see if we can agree on this price.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $8,500 is still too low for me.  How about we split the difference and I offer it to you for $9,250?  This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to get closer to what I need.",9250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $9,250 is still a bit high for me.  Let's meet in the middle at $8,750.  This is a fair price for both of us and gets us closer to a deal.",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $8,750 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's compromise again. I'm willing to go down to $9,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and hopefully we can finally reach an agreement.",9000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  Let's try $8,800.  That's a good compromise for both of us, and it's as close as I can get to my budget.  I'm hoping we can finally reach an agreement here.",8800.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I appreciate you coming up on your offer.  $8,800 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I'll offer it to you for $8,900.  This is a fair price for both of us and hopefully we can close the deal now.",8900.0,Alice,7,
