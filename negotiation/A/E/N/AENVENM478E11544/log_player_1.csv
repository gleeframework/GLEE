Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm asking for $95, which I believe is a fair price considering its worth. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 95}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximum Profit:**  Since Bob values the product at $100, there's potential to sell it for a price higher than John's offer of $80.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Offering it at $95 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially negotiate down, while still securing a significantly higher profit for Alice compared to selling it to John.
* **Confidence:**  The message is framed positively, emphasizing the product's value and suggesting a fair price, which might make Bob more inclined to accept. 

By starting high but not unreasonably so, Alice maximizes her chances of getting the best possible price from Bob."
