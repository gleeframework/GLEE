Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product, which I believe would be highly valuable to you. I'm asking for $10,000, considering its potential worth. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 10000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's $12,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $10,000 gives Bob the impression of a potential deal and leaves space for him to counter-offer if he wants to negotiate further.
* **Strong Alternative:** We have a backup offer from John at $8,000, giving us leverage. We don't need to desperately lowball the price. 

**Why not other prices?**

* **$12,000:** While ideal, it's unlikely Bob will accept this immediately, and it leaves no room for negotiation.
* **$8,000:** This is our minimum, and we can likely get more from Bob.
* **Between $8,000 - $10,000:** These prices don't leverage the product's full potential value to Bob."
