"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $10000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. Would you consider a price of $7500? ",7500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9000, which still leaves room for both of us to be happy. Let's find a middle ground!",9000.0,Alice,3,
