"I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1400000. I'm willing to pay a premium, but I have a budget in mind and I'd like to stay within it. Can you consider my offer?",1400000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm afraid $1400000 is still a bit below my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1600000. This is a very competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. What do you think?",1600000.0,Alice,3,
