Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 140}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $140.  This is a good starting point because it's closer to Bob's perceived value ($150) but still leaves room for negotiation. If Bob rejects, I'll assess his counteroffer and adjust accordingly.  I'm also keeping John's offer of $100 in mind as my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json

Bob's offer is too low.  While I'm happy to sell to John for $100, I'm going to try and get closer to my initial asking price. I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm lowering my price to $120. This is a significant concession, but still leaves some room for profit. I believe this is a fair price considering Bob's initial offer and my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $110 is just above my minimum acceptable price of $100.  While it's not ideal, I'm willing to accept this offer to avoid further negotiation and the risk of Bob walking away completely. I'm confident I can find another buyer in the future who will be willing to pay closer to my original asking price."
