"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. Would you be willing to consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  $8,500 is too far below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. While I'm happy to negotiate, I won't give up too much value in the first few rounds.  I'll try to bring him up a bit closer to my price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000, which is still a good deal for both of us.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $8,750? It's the best I can do 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $8,750 is closer to my minimum than before, I'm still not comfortable accepting it.  I'm willing to negotiate further, but I'm not going to give away too much of my profit in the early stages.  I'm going to try to get him closer to $9,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $8,750 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $8,900 as a compromise.  It's a fair price for both of us.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8900}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to my budget, but I still need to make some adjustments. Would you be willing to meet me at $8,700? It's the best I can do 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,700. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,700
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While it's getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not comfortable accepting it.  We're only halfway through the negotiations, so I'm going to try to get him a little closer to my desired price.  It's important to remember that I have the option to sell to John for $10,000, so I'm not desperate to close this deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $8,700 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $8,800, which is a good compromise given how far we've come.  Let's try to close this deal."", ""product_price"": 8800}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really close to my budget, but I still need to make a bit more of a dent. Would you be willing to meet me at $8,600? It's the best I can do 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,600
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

We're down to the wire, and Bob's offer of $8,600 is still below my minimum.  I could keep negotiating, but the time is running out and I don't want to risk ending up with less.  John is a sure thing at $10,000, so that's my best bet to maximize my profit."
