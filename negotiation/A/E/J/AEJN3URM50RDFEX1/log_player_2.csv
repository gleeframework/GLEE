You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $950,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his desired price.  There's still room for negotiation, and Bob should try to get the price down even further."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's latest offer is only $25,000 below her initial price. While Bob could try to negotiate further, the risk is that Alice might keep rejecting offers, or even increase the price.  At this point, it's more beneficial for Bob to accept the guaranteed $800,000 price from John, as it avoids further negotiation and potential delays."
