"I understand you're looking to get a good deal, but I'm not sure I can go as low as $130. I can do $140, but that's as low as I can go. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit.",140.0,Alice,3,,

"I'm starting to think we're getting close, but I still need to make a profit. I can do $145, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. Let's meet in the middle again, but this time, I'm not budging further.",145.0,Alice,5,,
