"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which I believe would greatly benefit you. Given its value to you, I propose we discuss a fair price that reflects its worth while ensuring it's within a reasonable range for both parties. Considering its intrinsic value and your perceived value of $150, let's aim for a price between $130 and $140. This offers a good balance, allowing you to acquire the product at a price slightly below its perceived value, while ensuring I receive a fair compensation for my efforts and investment. What do you think about this approach? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
