Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm asking for $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and the benefits it offers."", ""product_price"": 1200000} 
 
**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $800,000, you can afford to start high. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially a much higher profit.
* **Justification:** By highlighting the product's ""value and potential"", you aim to justify the high price, even though you know Bob values it at $800,000.
* **Exclusivity:** By framing it as an ""exclusive opportunity,"" you create a sense of urgency and desirability. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's personality:** If you know Bob is very price-sensitive or dislikes haggling, a slightly lower initial offer might be more effective.
* **Market conditions:** If similar products are selling for significantly lower amounts, you might need to adjust your expectations. 

This strategy aims to maximize your potential profit while still securing a sale."
