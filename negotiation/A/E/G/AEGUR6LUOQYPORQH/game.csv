"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $6,000.  Let me know if that works for you.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate you countering.  While $6,000 is too low, I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This is my final offer.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $10,500 is still a bit too steep for me. I could potentially do $7,500.  Let me know what you think.",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand where you're coming from, but $7,500 is unfortunately too low for me.  I could meet you halfway at $9,000. This is my final offer.",9000.0,Alice,5,
