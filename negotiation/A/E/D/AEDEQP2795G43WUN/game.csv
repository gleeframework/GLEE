"Thanks for the offer, Alice. That's a bit steep for me right now.  Would you consider $65?",65.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $65 is simply too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $90? It's still a good deal for you, and I'm willing to be flexible to make this happen.",90.0,Alice,3,

"I understand you can't go as low as $65, Alice.  How about we split the difference and do $75?",75.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $75 still doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to come down to $85.  This is my final offer, and it's a great deal for both of us.  What do you think?",85.0,Alice,5,
