Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product for $110. It's a fantastic deal for you, and I'm sure you'll love it. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above Bob's valuation:** This gives Bob incentive to negotiate.
* **It's below my minimum:** I'm still making a profit.
* **It's a reasonable price:**  It's not too aggressive, which might make Bob walk away. 

Let's see if Bob takes the bait!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. That's a bit steep for me right now.  Would you consider $65? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $65. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $65
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is way too low.  While I'm open to negotiation, $65 is significantly below my minimum.  I'll reject his offer and see if I can get him closer to my desired price range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $65 is simply too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $90? It's still a good deal for you, and I'm willing to be flexible to make this happen."", ""product_price"": 90} 
```

I'm trying to find a price that's closer to my minimum and still appealing to Bob.  $90 is a compromise that demonstrates I'm serious about making a deal while still protecting my profit margin."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you can't go as low as $65, Alice.  How about we split the difference and do $75? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $75 is a better offer than $65, it's still not enough for me.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to push him a bit higher.  I'm confident I can get closer to my minimum price without risking a deal with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $75 still doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to come down to $85.  This is my final offer, and it's a great deal for both of us.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 85}
```

I'm getting closer to Bob's valuation, but I'm also trying to stay above my minimum. This offer is a good compromise, and I'm hoping Bob will finally accept."
