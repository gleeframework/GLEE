"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to me is much higher. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point as it:

* **Leaves room for negotiation:** I'm not asking for my full value, allowing space for Bob to counter.
* **Reflects the value gap:**  The price is significantly higher than what the product is worth to Bob, but still lower than my minimum.
* **Is positive and encouraging:**  The message is friendly and emphasizes the benefit to Bob. 

I'm confident that this offer will initiate a productive negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Can you consider that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $9,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly less than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  I have 10 rounds to negotiate, and I want to maximize my profit. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $9,000 is tempting, I'm still hoping for something a bit closer to my initial offer.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,500? It's still a great price for you, and allows me to recover some of my investment. "", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving closer to Bob's offer:**  I'm demonstrating flexibility by lowering my price, but still keeping it significantly higher than his offer.
* **Appealing to Bob's value:** I'm reminding him that this is still a good deal for him, considering the product's value to him is $8,000.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  This offer still leaves room for further negotiation if needed. 

This counteroffer aims to find a middle ground that is beneficial to both parties, while keeping the negotiation moving forward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $9,000. Would you be willing to consider $9,200? It's a compromise, but I think it's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my acceptable price, it's still below my minimum threshold.  I believe I can achieve a better price by continuing to negotiate. I have several rounds left, and I don't want to settle for less than what I believe the product is worth.  I'll counteroffer again in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $9,200 is still a bit too far below my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again at $9,700. This would allow me to cover some of my costs and give you a great deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9700}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Continuing to move towards Bob's offer:** I'm showing flexibility by lowering my price again, demonstrating my commitment to reaching an agreement.
* **Highlighting the value proposition:** I'm emphasizing that this price is still a good deal for Bob, considering the product's value to him is $8,000.
* **Leaving room for compromise:** This offer still allows for a slight adjustment, but it's getting closer to my minimum acceptable price.

This counteroffer aims to find a mutually beneficial price point and hopefully secure a deal in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable going above $9,000. Would you be willing to consider $9,100? It's a small concession, but I think it's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

We are nearing the end of the negotiation rounds, and Bob's offer is still significantly below my minimum price of $15,000.  While I'm willing to negotiate, I don't want to settle for a price that is too low. It's clear that Bob is unwilling to budge much further. 

Considering that John is willing to pay my full asking price of $15,000, I'm better off selling to him. It ensures I get my desired price and avoids the risk of continuing negotiations that might ultimately lead to a lower price."
