Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice, but I'm a bit concerned about the price. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the value you mentioned earlier, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

""message"": ""Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective on the price.  While I'm confident in the $14,000 value, I'm open to finding a solution that works for both of us. How about we meet halfway at $11,500?"",

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to find a compromise, Alice. However, $11,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $9,500, but I think that's as high as I can go. Can you consider meeting me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

Bob is not moving significantly towards a price that reflects the product's value. It's better to take the guaranteed $10,000 from John than to continue negotiating with Bob and risk getting even less."
