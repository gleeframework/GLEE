,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $120 is a bit too high for me.  How about $90?  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $90 is too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $105? I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $105 is still a bit more than I'm willing to pay.  How about we meet in the middle at $100?  That's a fair price for both of us, and we can close the deal.",100.0,Bob,4,
