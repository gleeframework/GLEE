Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the opportunity,  $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product, which is a fair price considering its value to me.  Let me know what you think.

Bob's offer:
