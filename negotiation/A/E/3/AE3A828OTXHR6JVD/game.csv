"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $900,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, I think $900,000 is a bit high. I'd be willing to purchase it for $700,000.  What do you think?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm afraid I can't accept $700,000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm proposing a counteroffer of $850,000. This is a fair price, considering the benefits you'll gain from owning this product. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  However, I'm still a little ways off from $850,000.  Would you consider $750,000? I feel this is a fair compromise.",750000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your desire to reach a compromise, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not comfortable accepting $750,000.
