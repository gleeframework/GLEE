"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! Given its value to you, I'm confident we can find a price that benefits both of us.  My initial offer is $1,400,000.  What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but that price is a bit high for me. How about we bring it down to $1,100,000? ",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,100,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  Given the value you place on this product, I'm confident we can bridge the gap.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,250,000? This would still leave you with a significant profit margin while allowing me to achieve a fair price. ",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $1,250,000 is closer, but I need to be a bit more aggressive with my budget.  Would you consider $1,175,000?",1175000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm willing to be flexible but $1,175,000 is still below my minimum.  Let's split the difference - I'll accept $1,212,500.  That's a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away satisfied. ",1212500.0,Alice,5,
