"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but that price is a bit high for me. How about we bring it down to $1,100,000?  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

``` 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While I'm interested in selling to him, $1,100,000 is below my minimum threshold. I believe we can find a more mutually agreeable price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,100,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  Given the value you place on this product, I'm confident we can bridge the gap.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $1,250,000 is closer, but I need to be a bit more aggressive with my budget.  Would you consider $1,175,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,175,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,175,000

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm willing to be flexible but $1,175,000 is still below my minimum.  Let's split the difference - I'll accept $1,212,500.  That's a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away satisfied. "", ""product_price"": 1212500}
