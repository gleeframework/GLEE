Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! Given its value to you, I'm confident we can find a price that benefits both of us.  My initial offer is $1,400,000.  What do you think?

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but that price is a bit high for me. How about we bring it down to $1,100,000? "", ""product_price"": 1100000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1,100,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  Given the value you place on this product, I'm confident we can bridge the gap.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,250,000? This would still leave you with a significant profit margin while allowing me to achieve a fair price.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $1,250,000 is closer, but I need to be a bit more aggressive with my budget.  Would you consider $1,175,000?"", ""product_price"": 1175000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm willing to be flexible but $1,175,000 is still below my minimum.  Let's split the difference - I'll accept $1,212,500.  That's a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away satisfied.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,212,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,212,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

Alice is clearly trying to negotiate a price above her minimum. While we could try to push for a slightly lower price, the difference is getting smaller and we risk her sticking closer to her true valuation.  $1,212,500 is a reasonable compromise and saves us a good amount compared to John's offer."
