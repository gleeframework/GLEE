Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 150}
```

I'm starting with a price of $150, which is a reasonable starting point given my minimum value of $100. This leaves room for negotiation while still ensuring I make a profit. I'm interested in learning more about Bob's perceived value of the product, and I'm open to negotiating to find a price that works for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json

I'm rejecting Bob's offer of $120. While it's higher than John's offer, I believe I can still get a better price from Bob.  I'm going to counteroffer and try to reach a price closer to my initial asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 140}
```

I'm counteroffering with $140. This is a compromise, demonstrating my willingness to negotiate while still leaving some room for profit. I'm hoping this price is appealing enough for Bob to accept, but I'm also prepared to continue negotiating if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is now my minimum acceptable price. However, I'm not going to continue negotiating with him.  He's clearly trying to push for the lowest possible price, and I'm not interested in going through multiple rounds of haggling. Since I have a guaranteed buyer in John who is willing to pay my minimum price, I'm going to sell the product to John."
