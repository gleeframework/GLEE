"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

The product is worth $1,000,000 to Alice, and she is offering it at $1,200,000. This means Alice has a high margin, and there is room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer will allow Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially save money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

This counteroffer is a significant reduction from Alice's initial price, but it still offers a decent profit margin for her, considering the product is worth $1,000,000 to her. This should start the negotiation and give Bob a good starting point."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice has reduced her price from $1,200,000 to $1,100,000, which is a good sign. However, it's still significantly higher than what Bob is willing to pay.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue negotiating and hopefully get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

Bob is increasing his offer slightly from the previous round, showing willingness to negotiate but still staying within his budget. This counteroffer is a compromise, allowing for potential agreement without sacrificing too much."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice has lowered her price to $1,050,000, but it's still above Bob's limit.  There's still potential to negotiate a lower price, so rejecting the offer and continuing the negotiation is the best course of action."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.
