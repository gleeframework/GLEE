"Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $8,000 is just too far below what I need to sell.  I'm willing to come down a bit more. How about $8,800?  That's a fair compromise, and I think it's a great deal for you. ",8800.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $8,800 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $8,500. If you're open to that, we can close the deal. ",8500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm really hoping we can reach an agreement. I'm willing to come down to $8,700. That's a significant compromise on my end. I'm confident this price still represents a great value for you. What do you say?",8700.0,Alice,5,
