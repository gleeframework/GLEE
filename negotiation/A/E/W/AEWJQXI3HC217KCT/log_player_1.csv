"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested but I'm looking to spend closer to $8,000. Would you be willing to consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $8,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum value of $10,000.  I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, hoping to get closer to my desired price point.  However, I'm keeping the option to sell to John open, as he offers a guaranteed $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $8,000 is just too far below what I need to sell.  I'm willing to come down a bit more. How about $8,800?  That's a fair compromise, and I think it's a great deal for you. "", ""product_price"": 8800} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $8,800 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $8,500. If you're open to that, we can close the deal.  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable value. I'm not ready to give up just yet and am willing to risk another round of negotiation.  I believe there's still room for Bob to come up in his offer. However, if the next round doesn't get me closer to my target, I'll sell to John to guarantee the $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm really hoping we can reach an agreement. I'm willing to come down to $8,700. That's a significant compromise on my end. I'm confident this price still represents a great value for you. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 8700}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand we're getting close, but I'm still hoping to finalize this at $8,500. If you're not willing to go that low, I might need to consider other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

It's clear that Bob is unwilling to budge further, and I'm running out of rounds.  While I would like to earn more, at this point, it's more important to ensure I get my minimum value.  Selling to John guarantees $10,000, and it's the safest option to secure my financial goal."
