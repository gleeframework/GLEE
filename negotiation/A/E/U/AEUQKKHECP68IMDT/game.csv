"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which has been valued at $120 by myself. Considering its quality and benefits, I believe it's worth more than $100 to you. Would you like to make an offer closer to $120, or shall I proceed with the initial asking price? I'm looking forward to your response.",120.0,Alice,1,
