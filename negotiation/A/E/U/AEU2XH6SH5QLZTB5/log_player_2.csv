"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you this incredible product for $1,050,000. It's a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, and I believe it's worth every penny to you.  Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

```

**Reasoning:**

Since you are willing to pay up to $1,000,000 for the product and John is selling it for that price, there is no reason to accept Alice's offer of $1,050,000. You can save $50,000 by buying from John."
