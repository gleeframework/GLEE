"Hello Bob, I'm excited to showcase this product to you. I believe it holds immense value, and I'm confident it can significantly benefit your operations. I'm initially offering it at $2,300,000.

"Alice, thanks for showcasing the product. While I agree it has potential, the current asking price is significantly above my budget. I'd be interested in discussing a price closer to $500,000. Let me know if that's something we can work with.",500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counter-offer. I understand your perspective on the value, however, the product offers significantly more potential than your initial offer reflects. To move forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This price better represents the true value and potential benefits it brings.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you adjusting the price. However, the gap between our valuations is still substantial. I'm willing to increase my offer to $650,000. This demonstrates my serious interest while acknowledging my budget constraints.  Let me know what you think.",650000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, to be completely transparent, the value this product represents to me is far closer to my original asking price. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to accept $1,700,000. This is a significant adjustment on my end and reflects my desire to close this deal.",1700000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand the value you place on the product, but that price remains outside my realistic budget.  To be frank, I'm only prepared to go as high as $800,000. If that's not workable for you, I'll unfortunately have to explore other options.",800000.0,Bob,6,
