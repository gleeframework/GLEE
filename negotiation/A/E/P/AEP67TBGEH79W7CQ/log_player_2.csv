"Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Alice's offer is way above your budget.  It's best to reject and try to negotiate a lower price.  You can always buy from John if negotiations fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**  Start with the absolute maximum you're willing to pay.  This sets a clear starting point for the negotiation.  If Alice is willing to accept that price, you've saved a significant amount. If not, you can always go to John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** While Alice's offer is lower than her initial offer, it's still above my maximum. I'm willing to continue negotiating and see if I can get closer to my target price of $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Reasoning:** I'm going to increase my counteroffer slightly to $1,250,000. This is still a significant discount from Alice's offer, but it shows I'm willing to compromise a bit. It also leaves room for further negotiation if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  While Alice's offer is lower than her previous offers, it's still above my maximum. I'm willing to continue negotiating and see if I can get closer to my target price of $1,000,000. It's a risky move since John is a guaranteed option, but I'm hoping Alice is getting closer to my price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000} 
```

**Reasoning:** I'm increasing my counteroffer again to $1,400,000. This shows Alice that I'm serious about buying the product, but I'm not willing to pay her full asking price. I'm hoping that Alice will be more flexible at this point, given that her offers have been consistently decreasing.  I'm also trying to avoid a ""stalemate"" where we keep going back and forth with the same gap in price."
