"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $1,000,000. Let me know what you think!",1750000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,750,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. This is still a good profit for you, and it fits within my budget. Let's see if we can work something out.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $1,200,000 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $1,475,000? That still gives you a significant profit, and it's closer to my asking price. What do you say?",1475000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,475,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,350,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to me and your desired profit margin. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1350000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob,  I'm getting the feeling we're not going to agree on a price. I'm willing to go down to $1,400,000, but that's my final offer.  If you're not willing to meet me there, I'll have to take my business elsewhere. This is a great deal for you, and I'm giving you my best price. Let me know what you decide.",1400000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand you're firm on your price, but $1,400,000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,375,000.  This is a good compromise for both of us. Let's close this deal. ",1375000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I appreciate you coming up in your offer.  However, $1,375,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and go down to $1,387,500.  This is my final counteroffer.  If we can't agree on this, I'm going to have to sell to someone else.",1387500.0,Alice,7,
