Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $175. This is above my minimum of $150, and hopefully, it will be a good starting point for negotiation. I'm confident Bob will see value in the product and be willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $160
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json

``` 

Bob's offer is close to my minimum, and I'm willing to accept it.  It's better than selling to John for $150 and saves me the hassle of further negotiation."
