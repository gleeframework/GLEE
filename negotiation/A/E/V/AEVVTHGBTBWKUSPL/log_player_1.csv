Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting with a high price of $1,500,000.  This is a strong opening offer that allows room for negotiation. It's also significantly higher than my minimum value for the product, which gives me some leeway if Bob counteroffers. 

If Bob rejects, I will assess his counteroffer and determine if it's worth continuing the negotiation. I'll also keep John in mind as a fallback option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $1,200,000 is a decent offer, it's still below my desired price point. I believe I can get closer to my ideal value by continuing to negotiate with Bob. I'll counteroffer and see if we can bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm countering Bob's offer with $1,350,000. This is a compromise that shows I'm willing to meet him halfway while still ensuring a profit above my minimum.  I'm hoping this will be a sweet spot for him to accept, but I'm prepared to negotiate further if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,100,000 is getting closer to my minimum, it's still not quite enough to justify selling to Bob.  I'm willing to risk a bit more and see if I can get him to go higher.  I'll make a counteroffer, hoping to bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

```

I'm countering Bob's offer with $1,200,000.  This is a significant concession, but I'm still getting close to my desired price point. I'm hoping this final offer will be enough to convince Bob to accept, but I'm prepared to walk away and sell to John if it's not."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,050,000 is just above my minimum, but not enough to make it worthwhile to continue negotiating.  I'm willing to accept John's offer of $1,000,000, as this is the best option for ensuring I at least meet my minimum desired value for the product."
