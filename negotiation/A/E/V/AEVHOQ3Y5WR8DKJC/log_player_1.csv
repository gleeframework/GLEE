Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a unique opportunity to purchase a product of significant value. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,250,000.  I believe this reflects its true worth and the substantial benefits it offers. Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 2250000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, you can afford to start high. This leaves room for negotiation while ensuring you don't settle for less than your fallback option.
* **Strategic Premium:** Offering the product at $2,250,000 (a 50% markup) aims to capitalize on Bob's equal valuation. It implies the product's scarcity and potential for high returns, potentially motivating Bob to accept even with the premium.
* **Open Communication:** The message emphasizes a ""unique opportunity"" and ""substantial benefits,"" creating a sense of value. It also invites Bob's feedback, leaving room for negotiation and potentially a quicker close to the deal. 
 
**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate based on Bob's response and any additional information you gather during the negotiation process."
