"I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $130?",130.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Bob! I understand that $150 might be a bit high for you. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we compromise at $140? It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",140.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $140 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $135?",135.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $135 is still a bit high for you, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $137? It's the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great deal for you.",137.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $137 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $120 and $137, which would be $128.50. Would you be willing to accept this price?",128.5,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that $128.50 is a good compromise, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go that low. I'll meet you halfway between $137 and $128.50, which would be $132.75. It's the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for you.",132.75,Alice,7,
