"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
```

I'm starting high, aiming for a profit.  Since the product is worth $15,000 to me, I want to get as close to that as possible. Bob knows the product is worth $10,000 to him, so I'm hoping he'll see the value in negotiating and come closer to my price.  I'll be prepared to counteroffer if needed, but want to see if I can secure a good deal quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is far too low. While I could accept it, I'm not willing to sell for such a low price. I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round.  I want to keep the negotiations open, but I'm also aware that John is a reliable alternative buyer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 16000}
```

I'm coming down a bit from my initial price, but still aiming for a significant profit.  I know Bob won't pay my original asking price, but I believe he'll be willing to pay a bit more than $10,000. This counteroffer is a compromise, showing I'm willing to negotiate, but still putting a good deal on the table for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's still not enough. I want to squeeze out more profit if possible.  I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round.  I'm still hopeful that I can secure a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

I'm getting closer to John's offer.  I believe that Bob is likely to accept this price, as it's a good deal for him, considering the value of the product for him. I'm willing to take a bit less profit to avoid the risk of losing the deal and having to accept John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, and I don't want to risk losing the deal by continuing to counteroffer.  I'm confident that I can find a buyer for the product for at least $15,000, but I'd prefer to secure a sale now rather than waiting for another buyer.  Accepting Bob's offer will secure me a decent profit."
