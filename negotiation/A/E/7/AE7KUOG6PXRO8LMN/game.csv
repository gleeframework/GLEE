"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer but $12,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend.  I'm interested in your product but would only be able to go up to $9,000.  Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. While $9,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $10,500.  This would still give you a great value for the product, and it's a price I can live with.  What do you say?",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm ready to finalize the deal at $9,500. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll agree. Let's close this deal!",9500.0,Bob,4,
