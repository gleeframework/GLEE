"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $12,000 is better than Alice's initial value of $15,000, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $8,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer but $12,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend.  I'm interested in your product but would only be able to go up to $9,000.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to find a middle ground. He's offering a price that's closer to his maximum budget while still leaving some room for negotiation. This counteroffer shows that Bob is serious about buying the product but is also willing to walk away if the price isn't right."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. While $9,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $10,500.  This would still give you a great value for the product, and it's a price I can live with.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $10,500 is better than Alice's previous offer, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $8,000.  Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation open and allows Bob to try and get a lower price. There's still a chance Alice might be willing to go lower, especially if she wants to close the deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm ready to finalize the deal at $9,500. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll agree. Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting closer to his maximum budget but still leaving room for a potential compromise. Offering $9,500 shows he's serious about buying the product while also demonstrating a willingness to meet Alice halfway.  This counteroffer strategically pushes Alice closer to Bob's preferred price point."
