Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,000,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering its worth in the market. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  While Bob's perceived value is lower, Alice knows she has John as a guaranteed backup.  Starting at $1,000,000 leaves room for negotiation but keeps the price significantly above Bob's valuation.
* **Justification:**  The message vaguely mentions ""market worth"" to imply the product's value could be even higher than Bob realizes. 
* **Leaving the Door Open:** Alice ends with ""Let me know your thoughts,"" inviting negotiation and keeping the conversation going.

**Strategy:**

This approach aims to anchor Bob's thinking at a higher price point. Even if he rejects the initial offer, it gives Alice leverage to potentially negotiate down slightly while still securing a price significantly above $800,000. If Bob outright rejects the offer, Alice can confidently proceed with John, knowing she secured the best possible outcome."
