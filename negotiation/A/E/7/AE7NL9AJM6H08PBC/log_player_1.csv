Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product! I'm excited to discuss the price with you. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer you the product for $900,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for our negotiation."", ""product_price"": 900000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer.  $900,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to save as much as possible.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering your value of $800,000 and my maximum budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your desire to save as much as possible. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. Considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer you the product for $875,000. This is a reasonable compromise, taking into account both our values."", ""product_price"": 875000}"
