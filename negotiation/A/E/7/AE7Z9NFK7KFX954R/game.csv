"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a little too high for my budget. Would you consider $5,500?",5500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $5,500 is significantly below what I can accept.  How about we split the difference and meet at $9,000? This would still be a good deal for you, considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can make this work.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that $5,500 is a significant drop, Alice. While $9,000 is closer, it's still a bit of a stretch for me. How about we settle at $7,000? That feels like a fair compromise.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $7,000 is still significantly below what I need to accept. Given the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway at $8,500. This is a fair compromise that allows both of us to benefit.  Let me know if you're open to this.",8500.0,Alice,5,
