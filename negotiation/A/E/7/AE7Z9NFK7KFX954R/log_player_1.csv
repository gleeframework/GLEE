Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. This is a great price considering its value to you.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price higher than what the product is worth to Bob, but lower than my minimum acceptable price. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Highlighting value:** I emphasize the product's value to Bob, making it seem like a good deal.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** I'm open to negotiation, as I'm aware that Bob might counteroffer.  

**Next steps:**

* If Bob accepts, I've made a decent profit.
* If Bob rejects, I'll assess his counteroffer.  If it's too low, I'll counter again. 
* If the negotiation drags on or becomes unproductive, I'll choose to sell to John for $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a little too high for my budget. Would you consider $5,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $5,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $5,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $5,500 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000 and even less than what the product is worth to him ($8,000).
* **Negotiation potential:** While Bob's offer is unacceptable, he's still interested in the product. This means there's potential for further negotiation.
* **Avoiding a loss:** Accepting Bob's offer would result in a huge financial loss. It's better to try and get a better price or sell to John.

**Next steps:**

I'll counter Bob's offer with a price that's closer to my minimum acceptable price. I need to find a balance between getting a reasonable price and keeping Bob interested in the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $5,500 is significantly below what I can accept.  How about we split the difference and meet at $9,000? This would still be a good deal for you, considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** My counteroffer is a compromise, showing willingness to negotiate.
* **Highlighting value (again):** I remind Bob of the product's value to him, making $9,000 seem more reasonable.
* **Staying firm:**  The price is still above Bob's initial offer, but closer to my minimum acceptable price.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, I've made a good profit. 
* If Bob rejects, I'll analyze his next offer. I'm prepared to counter again, but I also need to consider the time commitment and whether selling to John is a better option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that $5,500 is a significant drop, Alice. While $9,000 is closer, it's still a bit of a stretch for me. How about we settle at $7,000? That feels like a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still too low:** While Bob's offer of $7,000 is an improvement, it's still far below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Risk of stalling:** Accepting Bob's offer would mean losing out on a significant portion of the product's value. It's also a risk that the negotiation could stall if I continue to concede.
* **John is a backup:** I have a guaranteed buyer in John, who's willing to pay my minimum price.

**Next Steps:**

I'll make a final counteroffer to Bob. I'll aim for a price closer to my minimum, but also keep in mind the possibility of selling to John if Bob rejects. It's time to push for a more favorable outcome, but without jeopardizing the deal with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $7,000 is still significantly below what I need to accept. Given the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway at $8,500. This is a fair compromise that allows both of us to benefit.  Let me know if you're open to this."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Counteroffer:** This is my last counteroffer before considering John's offer.
* **Meeting Halfway (Again):**  I'm offering to meet halfway between my last offer and Bob's, signaling a willingness to compromise while still securing a decent price.
* **Highlighting Value (One Last Time):** I emphasize the product's value to Bob to justify the price and make it seem like a good deal for him. 
* **Prepared for Rejection:** I'm ready to accept John's offer if Bob rejects this final offer.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, I've successfully negotiated a price close to my desired range.
* If Bob rejects, I'll move forward with selling to John for $15,000."
