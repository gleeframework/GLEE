Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $5,500 is significantly below what I can accept.  How about we split the difference and meet at $9,000? This would still be a good deal for you, considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can make this work.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $7,000 is still significantly below what I need to accept. Given the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway at $8,500. This is a fair compromise that allows both of us to benefit.  Let me know if you're open to this.

Alice is unlikely to go below $8,500.  You can get the product for $8,000 from John, so it makes more sense to take that deal."
