"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $13,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm only willing to pay $8,500 for the product. This is my best offer, considering its value to me.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $8,500 is significantly below its value. I could consider $11,500, which would be a fair compromise.",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11,500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about we meet in the middle at $9,500?  This would be a fair price for both of us.",9500.0,Bob,4,
