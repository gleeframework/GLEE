"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering this product for $13,000. I believe it offers significant value, even exceeding the price for someone who needs what it provides. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than what Bob is willing to pay. It's in Bob's best interest to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $13,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm only willing to pay $8,500 for the product. This is my best offer, considering its value to me."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but $8,500 is significantly below its value. I could consider $11,500, which would be a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial one, it's still higher than what Bob is willing to pay.  There's room for further negotiation.  Bob should try to get the price closer to his target of $8,000."
