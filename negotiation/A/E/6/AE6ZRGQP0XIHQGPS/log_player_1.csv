Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to sell the product. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the price of $1,750,000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,400,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
 I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get a better price.  While $1,400,000 is close to my minimum, I believe I can still get closer to my initial asking price.  I have 8 rounds left, and I'm not yet at a point where I'm desperate to sell."
