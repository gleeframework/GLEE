"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but the price is a bit high for me.  I'd be willing to pay $600,000 for it.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, $600,000 is significantly below its true value and what I'm willing to accept.  How about we meet in the middle at $950,000?  This price reflects the value it brings while still being a good deal for you.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  While $950,000 is closer, it's still a bit beyond my budget. How about $700,000? That's a significant investment on my end and reflects a fair price.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $700,000 is still too low for a product of this caliber. Let's settle this at $875,000. This offer takes into account our previous discussions and presents a win-win scenario for both of us.",875000.0,Alice,5,
