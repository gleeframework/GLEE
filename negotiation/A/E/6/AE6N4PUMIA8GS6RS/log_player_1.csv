I'm offering the product to Bob for $11,500. This is a good starting point as it's above my minimum price but still leaves room for negotiation if Bob wants to counteroffer.  I'm also keeping in mind that I can always sell to John for $10,000 if the negotiation with Bob fails."

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's close to my minimum price, I believe I can still get a better deal. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm countering Bob's offer with $11,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer, showing a willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a price closer to my desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While I'd prefer a higher price, $10,750 is a decent deal considering I can always sell to John for $10,000. It's a good compromise, and I don't want to risk losing out on a sale altogether."
