"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I'm excited to present our premium product to you. It's not just an item; it's an investment in quality and efficiency. Given its value to you, we believe it's worth $9,500. This price reflects its high worth and the benefits it offers. We're confident it will meet and exceed your expectations. Please let us know if this offer suits your budget. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's product is valuable, her offer of $9,500 is still higher than your maximum budget of $10,000. Since you can get the product from John for $10,000, rejecting Alice's offer and buying from John is the best choice to save money."
