"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your offer.  However, $150 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $175, but that's my final offer. What do you say?",175.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I'm happy to meet you halfway, $160 still feels a bit low. How about we split the difference and go with $165?  That way we both get a fair deal. ",165.0,Alice,5,
