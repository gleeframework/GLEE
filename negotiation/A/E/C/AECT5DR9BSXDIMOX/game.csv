"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value, I'm proposing a starting price of $14,000. What are your thoughts?",14000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I believe we can come to an agreement closer to my budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your response. While I appreciate your interest, $8,000 is significantly below its true value.  I could consider a price of $12,000.  This feels like a fair compromise.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I understand your position, but given my budget constraints, I believe we might not be able to reach an agreement at $12,000. Could we perhaps discuss a price closer to $9,500? I hope this proposal is within your consideration.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $9,500 is close, but to be fair to both of us, I can't go below $11,000.  This is my final offer.",11000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for your offer. I've reviewed my budget again and I think we can find common ground if you consider $10,500 for the product. I hope this is a proposal you can work with.",10500.0,Bob,6,
