Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I believe we can come to an agreement closer to my budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $8,000?

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your response. While I appreciate your interest, $8,000 is significantly below its true value.  I could consider a price of $12,000.  This feels like a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 12000}"
