"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $2,000,000 is above my budget. Given my understanding of the product's value and my research, I'm prepared to offer $1,300,000. This is a fair price that reflects the potential benefits and allows for a mutually beneficial transaction.",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand your perspective.  However, the product's value is significantly higher than your initial offer reflects. I'm willing to meet you halfway and counter at $1,750,000.",1750000.0,Alice,3,
