"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $2,000,000 is above my budget. Given my understanding of the product's value and my research, I'm prepared to offer $1,300,000. This is a fair price that reflects the potential benefits and allows for a mutually beneficial transaction. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand your perspective.  However, the product's value is significantly higher than your initial offer reflects. I'm willing to meet you halfway and counter at $1,750,000."", ""product_price"": 1750000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $1,750,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,450,000. This offer acknowledges the value of the product while remaining within my budget. Let's find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

Reason: Bob is unlikely to move much closer to my minimum price. Accepting his offer of $1,450,000 means losing out on a guaranteed $50,000 that John is offering.  It's time to take the guaranteed offer."
