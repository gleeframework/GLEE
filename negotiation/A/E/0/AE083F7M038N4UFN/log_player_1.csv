"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 150}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's higher than my minimum, but still leaves room for negotiation.  I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because $120 is still below my desired price point. I believe there is still room for negotiation and I want to see if I can get closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 135}
``` 

I'm offering a price that's halfway between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. This shows I'm willing to compromise but also that I believe the product is worth more than $120."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  Although I would like to get closer to my initial asking price, I've already gone through three rounds of negotiation and it's likely that we're nearing the end of the process.  $125 is a good price, and it's better than selling to John for $100."
