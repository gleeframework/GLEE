"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for a product worth much more. Let me know what you think!",10000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you be willing to consider $6,500?",6500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $6,500 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about $8,500?  Let's meet in the middle and make this happen.",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $8,500 is closer to what I had in mind, but I'm afraid it's still a little beyond my budget. Would you consider $7,000? I'm ready to make a deal today at that price.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $7,000 just doesn't work for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $7,500?  It's a fair price for both of us.",7500.0,Alice,5,
