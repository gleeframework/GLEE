(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $75 is a good price, it's still worth exploring if I can get a better deal. I'm going to reject the offer and see if Alice is willing to come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the early bird discount, but I'm looking to get the product for a bit less. I'm willing to pay $65. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 65}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and would like to make a counteroffer. For the next few hours, we can negotiate the price between $65 and $70. Please let me know if this range suits you better. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $67.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $67.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $67.5, which is within the range she proposed and is a better price than what John is offering.  It's a good deal, and I'm confident I won't get it lower without risking the deal falling through."
