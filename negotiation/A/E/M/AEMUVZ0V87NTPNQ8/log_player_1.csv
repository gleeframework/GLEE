Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Offering $1,000,000 gives me a good starting point and leaves room for negotiation.
* **Attractive for Bob:** This price is still significantly lower than the product's worth to Bob ($1,200,000), making it appealing to him.
* **Safeguard:**  If Bob rejects, I can still go to John and get $800,000, so I'm not taking a huge risk."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to make a deal, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Room for Improvement:** While $900,000 is closer to my desired price, I can still potentially get a better deal. 
* **Counteroffer Strategy:**  By rejecting Bob's offer, I can make a counteroffer and try to push the price closer to $1,000,000. 
* **Minimizing Risk:**  I'm not yet willing to settle for $900,000, but selling to John for $800,000 remains my backup option if things don't work out with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget concerns. I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $950,000?  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it a good value."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  This counteroffer shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate. 
* **Meeting Halfway:** $950,000 is a compromise between my previous offer ($1,000,000) and Bob's offer ($900,000).
* **Maintaining Leverage:** I'm still holding out for a price closer to my ideal, but this counteroffer keeps the negotiation moving forward and avoids a stalemate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above that price. How about $920,000? I think that's a fair price for the product, and it's within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Target:** $920,000 is very close to my ideal price of $950,000.
* **Minimizing Risk:**  While I could try for another counteroffer, there's no guarantee Bob will budge further. It's possible he'll become more resistant, or the negotiation could drag on. 
* **Time Value of Money:**  It's better to secure a good deal now than risk losing out on the sale entirely. Selling to John for $800,000 would be a significant loss compared to $920,000."
