Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really enjoy it. I'm offering it to you for $90. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 90}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value to see if he's willing to pay a premium. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  $90 leaves room for negotiation, allowing for a potential compromise that is still profitable for me.
* **Friendly Tone:** A positive message helps build rapport and encourages Bob to consider the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the recommendation and the value you see in the product. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $85 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price:** I am not willing to sell the product for less than $100, and Bob's offer of $85 falls short of that. 
* **I want to see if I can get closer to my target price:**  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to make a counteroffer and try to reach a price that is more beneficial to me.
* **John is a backup option:**  Even if I can't secure a better deal with Bob, I have the security of selling to John for $100, so I don't need to settle for a low price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I appreciate you're interested in the product.  While $85 is a good price, I'm looking to get a bit closer to $90. How about we split the difference at $87.50? Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 87.50}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a compromise that's closer to Bob's offer, but still above my minimum. 
* **Emphasis on Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the value of the product and why it's worth a bit more than his initial offer.
* **Friendly Tone:** Maintaining a positive and friendly tone helps keep the negotiation open and encourages Bob to consider my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to counter with an offer of $86 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $86. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $86
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:** Even with Bob's slight increase, the offer is still under my minimum acceptable price of $100.
* **Time is a factor:** While I could continue negotiating, it's likely that further rounds will only result in small price changes.  
* **John is a guaranteed deal:** Selling to John guarantees me my minimum acceptable price, eliminating any risk or delay.  

By choosing to sell to John, I secure a guaranteed profit and avoid potential further rounds of negotiation that might not yield a better result."
