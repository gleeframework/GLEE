Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its unique value proposition, I'm confident it will yield significant returns for you. I'm initially proposing a price of $1,350,000.  Let me know your thoughts, and we can discuss further."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($800,000) but below my minimum ($1,500,000). This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes the ""unique value proposition"" to justify the high price, even though Bob may not perceive it at $1,350,000.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The language ""initially proposing"" and ""discuss further"" signals willingness to negotiate, making Bob feel more comfortable counter-offering.

**Goal:**  The aim is to secure the highest possible price from Bob, ideally closer to $1,350,000. However, even if he negotiates down, any amount above my $1,500,000 minimum is a win, as John provides a guaranteed fallback option."
