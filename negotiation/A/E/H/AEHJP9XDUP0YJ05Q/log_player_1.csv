Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
```

I'm starting with a high price, knowing it's likely Bob will counteroffer. This gives me room to negotiate and hopefully secure a price closer to my desired value. I'm also keeping in mind that I have a backup option with John, so I'm not desperate to accept a low price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:

Bob's offer is closer to my desired value, but I'm not ready to settle yet. I'm going to try to push for a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm counteroffering at $1,900,000.  This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer. I'm hoping this shows I'm willing to negotiate but still want a price closer to my desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is very close to my desired value and only slightly lower than my previous counteroffer. It's likely we are close to an agreement, and further negotiation might just risk losing the deal. I'm going to accept his offer and secure a good price."
