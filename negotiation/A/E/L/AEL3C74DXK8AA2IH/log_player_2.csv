"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's better to try and negotiate with Alice further, as you can potentially get a better price. You're willing to pay up to $8,000, so there's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
``` 

I'm offering $8,500, which is a significant step down from Alice's offer but still leaves some room for her to profit.  This should open the negotiation and hopefully lead to a mutually agreeable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $9,800 is closer to my target, I'm still willing to push for a lower price.  There's still room for negotiation, and I don't want to settle unless I have to."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

I'm increasing my offer to $9,000, showing Alice that I'm serious about buying but still trying to keep the price down. This should hopefully be a compromise point that Alice is willing to accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice's offer is getting closer to my maximum, but it's still above my target.  I'm willing to risk a few more rounds to see if we can come to a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

I'm going to try to meet Alice halfway by offering $9,500. This should be a reasonable compromise that is close to both our desired prices."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's offer is getting worse, and it's clear she's not willing to compromise much further. I've already spent 6 rounds trying to negotiate, and there's a good chance we won't reach an agreement. It's time to cut my losses and buy the product from John for $8,000.  This guarantees I get the product at a price I'm comfortable with."
