Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you. I'm confident it will be a profitable investment. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's high enough that I'm still making a significant profit, but it's also low enough that Bob might consider it, given its value to him. 

I'm also setting a positive tone in my message, highlighting the potential benefits for Bob. This can help create a more collaborative negotiation environment."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Based on my budget constraints, I am proposing to purchase the product for $900,000. I believe this price reflects a fair compromise between the product's value to me and my financial situation. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below what I believe the product is worth. I'm confident that I can push for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $900,000 is still below my minimum price.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000, which is still a great deal for you considering the product's value. Let's meet halfway and finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
