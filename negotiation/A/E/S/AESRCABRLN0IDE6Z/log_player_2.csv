"Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $120 is less than what John would charge, you can potentially get a better deal. Rejecting Alice's offer allows you to make a counteroffer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering $100, which is significantly lower than Alice's initial price of $120, but still above her minimum of $80. This allows for some room to negotiate while also potentially getting a good deal for myself."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's new offer of $110 is a good price considering my maximum budget is $150.  It's also higher than my counteroffer of $100, so there is a chance that further negotiation might not lead to a lower price. Accepting this offer ensures I get the product within my budget and avoid the potential risk of further negotiation failing."
