"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential, I believe a price of $1,400,000 is fair. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $1,400,000 is less than Alice's valuation, it's still above Bob's maximum budget.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the value, however, I need to get closer to $1,400,000 for this to make sense for me. Would you consider $1,325,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000.

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to get the best price. While $1,325,000 is closer to Bob's maximum budget, there is still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make another counteroffer and potentially secure a lower price."
