Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it will be highly valuable to you. I'm willing to part with it for $150."",
""product_price"": 150
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $100, you should aim higher with Bob.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $150 allows for potential negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, and you can still settle for a price higher than your minimum. 
* **""Exclusive Opportunity""**:  This phrasing adds a sense of value and urgency, potentially making Bob more inclined to accept. 

**Important:** It's crucial to balance ambition with realism. An excessively high price might make Bob immediately walk away, leading you back to your $100 minimum with John."
