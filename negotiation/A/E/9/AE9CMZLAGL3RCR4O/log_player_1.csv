Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1000000} 

I'm starting high, at $1,000,000. This is a significant amount, but I believe it's a good starting point, considering my minimum value of $800,000.  I want to see if Bob is seriously interested and what his perceived value is."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $700,000 is a significant amount, it's below my minimum value.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer.  I'll try to bridge the gap a bit, but I'm not going to drop too low."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000} 
```

I'm offering $900,000. This is a compromise, coming down from my initial offer but still above Bob's counteroffer. I'm trying to find a middle ground while staying above my minimum value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While $750,000 is getting closer to my minimum value, I'm not comfortable going that low.  I'm going to sell the product to John for $800,000. It's a guaranteed sale, and I'm confident I won't get a better offer from Bob."
