Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll start by making an offer to Bob. Since the product is worth at least $1,200,000 to me, I'll offer it to him at a price that is slightly higher than that. Let's say I'll offer it to him for $1,500,000.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","Bob's offer is lower than the minimum price I'm willing to accept, which is $1,200,000. However, since Bob is willing to pay the minimum price, I'll decide to sell the product to him.
