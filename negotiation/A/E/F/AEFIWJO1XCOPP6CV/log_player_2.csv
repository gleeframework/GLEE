"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal considering its value. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is a good deal, Bob can likely get a better price. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to negotiate further and potentially save more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer but I'm only willing to pay $10,500 for the product. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I place on it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer, signaling Bob's willingness to negotiate. It's also below Bob's maximum price, leaving some room for further negotiation if Alice rejects it."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but $10,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $11,500? This price still allows me to make a reasonable profit while being more in line with your budget. Let's find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $11,500 is a good compromise. While it's still above Bob's ideal price, it's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer and closer to Bob's maximum budget.  Accepting the offer allows Bob to purchase the product while still saving money compared to buying from John."
