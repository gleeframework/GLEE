Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product for $11,000.  I know it's valuable to you, and I think this is a fair price that reflects its worth."", ""product_price"": 11000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed sale at $8,000, Bob is willing to pay up to $12,000.  
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $11,000 allows some room for Bob to potentially negotiate down slightly while still ensuring a significant profit for me. 
* **Strong Initial Offer:**  A strong initial offer shows Bob I understand the product's value and am serious about selling it to him."
