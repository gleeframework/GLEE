"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'd like to offer you the opportunity to purchase this exceptional product for a price that I believe is a fair compromise between our valuations. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,300,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,300,000 is less than her product valuation, you know you can get the product for $1,200,000 from John.  It makes the most financial sense to buy from John and save the extra $100,000."
