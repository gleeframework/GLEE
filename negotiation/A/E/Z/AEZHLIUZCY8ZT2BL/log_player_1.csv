Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you might be interested in. I'm willing to part with it for $125. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 125}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always best to start negotiations a bit higher than Bob's perceived value. This leaves room for negotiation and makes him feel like he's getting a deal if he manages to bring the price down.
* **Above Bob's Value, Below John's:**  The price of $125 is strategically placed. It's more than Bob values the product at ($80) but less than John is willing to pay ($150). This gives Bob an incentive to potentially negotiate, knowing you have other options. 

This strategy aims to maximize profit while still offering Bob a price he might consider reasonable."
