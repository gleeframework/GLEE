Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at the special price of $119. I know you'll find great value in it, so don't miss out!"", 
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $120, you want to see if Bob will pay even more.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product just below your guaranteed price creates a sense of urgency and makes Bob feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While the initial offer is $119, there might be a small window to negotiate with Bob if he counters, but you should not go below $120."
