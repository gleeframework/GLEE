,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I think $2000000 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1600000. Can we meet in the middle?",1600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1600000 is a significant discount, but I'm still looking to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving money on the table. I'm thinking of a counteroffer of $1800000. What do you think?",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above $1800000. I'm willing to go up to $1700000. Can we meet at this price?",1700000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Bob. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I still need to make a profit. I'm thinking of a counteroffer of $1750000. This is as low as I'm willing to go. What do you think?",1750000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm starting to think we're not going to meet in the middle, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure it's worth my while. I'm thinking of a counteroffer of $1680000. This is my final offer, and I expect you to take it or leave it.",1680000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to make one last concession, but I think $1680000 is still a bit too high. I'm willing to meet you at $1625000. This is my final offer, and I expect you to take it or leave it.",1625000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I've made concessions and I'm starting to feel like I'm giving away too much value. I'm not willing to go any lower than $1700000, and I think that's already a generous offer. I'm not accepting your offer of $1625000. I'm willing to walk away if you're not willing to meet me at $1700000.",1700000.0,Alice,9,

"I'm willing to meet you at $1675000. This is my absolute final offer. If you're not willing to accept this, I'll have to walk away and consider buying the product from John for $1500000.",1675000.0,Bob,10,
