{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. I think it's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price point that is advantageous to me, but still leaves room for negotiation. It also gives Bob a reason to accept my offer, as it is lower than the product's value to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking of something more like $11,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'd like to see some more flexibility on the price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. It's not worth selling the product at such a loss.  I will counteroffer and try to reach a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $11,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer. How about $13,000? It's still a fair price considering the value of the product to you."", ""product_price"": 13000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but I'm still a bit above my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $12,500? I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'd like to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $12,500 is above my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. It's a good deal for me considering I can always sell to John for $12,000 if I choose.  I'll accept this offer."
