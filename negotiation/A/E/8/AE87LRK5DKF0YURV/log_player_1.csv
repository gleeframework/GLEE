Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $1,450,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested buyers."",
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** We want to get as close to Bob's $1,000,000 valuation as possible while still exceeding our own minimum of $1,500,000.
* **Sense of Urgency:** Mentioning other buyers (John) creates a sense of urgency and scarcity, potentially pushing Bob to act quickly. 
* **High Initial Offer:** Starting with $1,450,000 leaves room for potential negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between securing a deal with Bob and maximizing profit. If Bob rejects this offer, we have the security of John's guaranteed purchase."
