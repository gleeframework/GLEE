"Alice, I appreciate the offer but $1,350,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm really interested in this product and am willing to pay $1,250,000. I believe this price reflects a fair value for both of us and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's see if we can come to a deal.",1250000.0,Bob,2,
