Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $20,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 20000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a higher profit.
* **Justification:**  While the message doesn't explicitly state the product's value to Bob, it implies a high value by using phrases like ""opportunity"" and ""given its value."" This subtly encourages Bob to consider the potential benefits. 
* **Leaving the Door Open:**  The question ""What do you think?"" invites Bob to engage in the negotiation rather than just giving a simple ""yes"" or ""no.""

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Perspective:** We don't know how good of a negotiator Bob is. A very savvy negotiator might try to lowball you. 
* **Risk Tolerance:** Offering a price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($15,000) carries the risk of him rejecting the offer outright. 

This initial offer aims to strike a balance between maximizing profit and securing a deal."
