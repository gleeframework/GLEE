It's better to reject Alice's offer and make a counteroffer. You can still potentially get a better price from Alice, and you're not losing anything by rejecting her initial offer."

It's still worth trying to negotiate with Alice. There's a chance she might come down further in price, and you're not losing anything by rejecting her offer."

At this point, Alice has come down to $890,000, which is still a bit more than John's offer of $800,000.  While there's a chance Alice might come down further, the risk of her rejecting another counteroffer and ending up paying more than John is too high. It's better to lock in the guaranteed lower price from John."
