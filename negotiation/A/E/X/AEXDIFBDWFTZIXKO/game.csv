"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $20000 is a bit more than I'm looking to spend right now.  Would you be willing to do $8000?  I'm really interested in the [Product Description] and that's the highest I can go.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you're looking for a good deal.  While $8000 is significantly lower than what I'm looking for, I'm willing to come down to $17000.  This would still give you a great deal on a [Product Description] that will be worth its weight in gold. Let's make this happen!",17000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $17000 but I'm still not quite there.  How about $12000?  That's a good compromise and I'm confident I can make this work for me.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $12000 is still a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $14000? This is a fair price for both of us and allows you to get a great deal on a [Product Description] that will be very valuable to you. Let's finalize this and make it happen!",14000.0,Alice,5,
