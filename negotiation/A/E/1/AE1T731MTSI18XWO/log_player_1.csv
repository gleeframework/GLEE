Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, so you won't accept anything less.
* **Bob's Value:**  Bob values the product at $1,200,000.
* **The Zone of Possible Agreement (ZOPA):**  Any price between $1,200,001 and $1,499,999 could potentially work for both of you.

**Strategy**

You want to aim high but leave Bob feeling like he's getting a somewhat reasonable deal. This makes him more likely to accept.

**The Offer**

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its unique value and potential, I'm offering it at a price of $1,400,000. I believe this represents a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Why This Offer?**

* **Strong Starting Point:** It's significantly above Bob's perceived value, giving you room to negotiate down if needed.
* **Justified Price:** The message implies the product's value justifies the high price. 
* **Leaves Room for Bob to Counter:** A slightly lower counter-offer from Bob would still land you a great deal.

**Important Notes:**

* **Bob's Response:**  How Bob responds will determine your next move. Be prepared to negotiate or politely decline if he's unwilling to meet you close to your asking price.
* **Alternative Buyers:**  Knowing you have John as a backup gives you leverage. If negotiations with Bob fail, you're still in a strong position."
