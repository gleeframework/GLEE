Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you working with me as well. I'm trying to be fair, but I need to get a reasonable price for this product. How about $12,000? That's my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000.

**Reasoning:**

Alice seems pretty firm on her price, and at $12,000, it's still exceeding our maximum budget. While we could continue negotiating, there's no guarantee she'll go below $8,000.  Buying from John guarantees we get the product at the price we've decided is our absolute maximum."
