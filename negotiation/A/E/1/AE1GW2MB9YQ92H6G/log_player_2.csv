{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than John's, Bob can still try to negotiate a lower price. By rejecting the offer, Bob can potentially get a better deal from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is trying to meet his goal of saving as much money as possible. He knows the product is worth $12,000 to Alice, and he's willing to pay up to $10,000. This counteroffer is a reasonable compromise, offering a price closer to his limit while still leaving room for potential negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is still higher than Bob's maximum price of $10,000. While further negotiation is possible, it's unclear if Alice is willing to go lower.  To ensure Bob saves the most money and doesn't risk further haggling, it's best to purchase the product from John at the guaranteed price of $10,000."
