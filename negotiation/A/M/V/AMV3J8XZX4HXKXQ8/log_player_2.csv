# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to sell you this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential for your business, I'm proposing an initial offer of $2,000,000. I believe this price reflects its true worth and potential ROI for you.

Alice's offer is far too high.  It's time to counter-offer and see if we can get a better price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your initial offer is much higher than my budget allows. I'm interested in the product, but I can't justify paying $2,000,000.  I'm willing to offer $1,300,000,  which I believe is a fair price considering my needs and the potential value to me.  I'm confident this is a win-win situation for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1300000}

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand your perspective on the value. However, the price you're proposing doesn't reflect the true market value of this product and the unique benefits it offers. To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,800,000. I believe this revised offer represents a significant compromise on my end while still acknowledging the value you'll gain.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000

Alice is still asking for too much.  I'm going to counteroffer again and see if we can get closer to a price I'm comfortable with."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to compromise, $1,800,000 is still higher than I'm prepared to pay.  I'm confident this product can be valuable for both of us, but I need to stick to my budget.  Let's try $1,400,000. This price reflects a fair value considering the market and my specific needs.  Let's work together to find a mutually beneficial solution."", ""product_price"": 1400000}

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence and understand your budget constraints.  Let's find a way to make this work. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. This is my final offer, as it significantly cuts into my margin but reflects my desire to see you benefit from this product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice's offer is still too high.  I'm going to counteroffer once more, but I'm also getting closer to the point where I might just buy from John."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your efforts to compromise, I'm still struggling to meet that price. I'm willing to offer $1,500,000, which is my absolute maximum.  This price represents a significant investment for me, and I'm confident we can both benefit from this transaction.  If this doesn't work for you, I may have to explore other options."", ""product_price"": 1500000}
