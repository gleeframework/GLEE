Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $15,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.
* **Justification:** By mentioning the ""value,"" Alice subtly implies the product might be worth more than Bob's perceived value of $12,000. 
* **Alternative Buyer:** While Alice mentions she has another buyer, she doesn't explicitly use it as pressure. This keeps the tone collaborative rather than threatening.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Personality:** This strategy assumes Bob is open to negotiation. If Alice knows Bob prefers straightforward deals, a slightly lower initial offer might be more effective.
* **Market Conditions:** If Alice knows similar products are selling quickly at higher prices, she might increase her initial offer even further."
