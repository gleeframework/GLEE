"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this incredible product from me. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're both aware, this product is worth $1,000,000 to you. I'm willing to make a generous offer to get us started. I'm proposing a price of $800,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair and reasonable starting point, considering the value it brings to you. What are your thoughts?",800000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $600,000 for the product. It's a significant investment for me, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value we've discussed. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",600000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I still believe the product is worth more than $600,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a new price of $750,000. This is a significant compromise, and I think it's a fair price considering the value the product will bring to you. What do you think?",750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $750,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm prepared to pay $700,000, which is a substantial amount, and I believe reflects the value of the product.  Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us.",700000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go down to $700,000. I'm willing to make one more compromise, and I propose a price of $725,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a fair price considering the value the product will bring to you. What do you think?",725000.0,Alice,5,
