"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your maximum budget of $1,200,000.  It's always beneficial to try and negotiate a lower price, especially since you have an alternative seller (John) who is willing to sell at your desired price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's initial price, aiming for a price point that's more aligned with my budget. This is a strong opening move to gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to my maximum budget, it's still higher than what I'm willing to pay. I'll continue negotiating with Alice, hoping to reach a price closer to $1,200,000.  There's still a chance I might need to purchase from John, but I want to exhaust all negotiation options with Alice first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly from the previous round. I'm trying to find a middle ground between my desired price and Alice's offer. By offering $1,150,000, I'm showing Alice that I'm serious about buying the product while still staying within my budget constraints. This counteroffer is a compromise that could potentially lead to a successful negotiation."
