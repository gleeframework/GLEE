"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for you, considering the value it brings. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price higher than what the product is worth to Bob, but lower than my minimum acceptable price. This gives him room to negotiate. 
* **Positive framing:**  I'm highlighting the value the product brings to him.
* **Open to negotiation:**  My message is open-ended, inviting Bob to respond. 

**Strategy:** 
I aim to get as close to my minimum acceptable price as possible. I will be willing to adjust my price slightly depending on Bob's response, but I'll always have the option to sell to John for $12,000 if negotiations fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe I can find the product elsewhere for a lower price. I am willing to pay up to $9,000 for it. Let me know if this is something we can work with. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price:**  While $9,000 is closer to my desired price, it's still not enough. 
* **Opportunity for further negotiation:**  There's still room to negotiate with Bob.  I can potentially get closer to my desired price with a counteroffer. 
* **Risk vs. reward:**  While selling to John is guaranteed $12,000, there's a chance I can get closer to that with Bob. The risk is that I may not reach a deal with Bob and have to sell to John at a lower price. 

**Strategy:** 

I will make a counteroffer in the next round that is closer to my desired price but still leaves room for further negotiation.  I'll monitor how willing Bob is to meet me halfway and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $9,000 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,500? This gives you a great price, and allows me to make a fair profit."", ""product_price"": 9500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** I'm proposing a price that is halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer, demonstrating my willingness to compromise.
* **Highlighting the benefit for Bob:** I emphasize that $9,500 is still a good deal for him.
* **Maintaining a firm stance:** I haven't dropped my price drastically, signaling that I'm serious about getting a reasonable price.

**Strategy:**

I'm aiming to find a middle ground that is acceptable to both of us. I'll continue to adjust my price based on Bob's responses, but I'm prepared to walk away if he doesn't come closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still looking to keep my costs down, so I would like to propose a price of $9,000. This is still within my budget and I hope it works for you as well. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price:**  While Bob has slightly increased his offer, it's still below my desired price of $12,000.
* **We're at an impasse:**  It seems we've hit a point where neither of us is willing to budge further.
* **Opportunity for a final counteroffer:** There's still a chance to close the deal with Bob, but I need to make a counteroffer that is enticing enough for him to accept.

**Strategy:**

I'll make a counteroffer in the next round that is slightly lower than my desired price, but still reflects the value of the product to me. I'll need to carefully assess the likelihood of Bob accepting and the risk of walking away to sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for the best possible price, and I'm willing to meet you halfway again.  Let's try $9,250. This price recognizes your budget while still allowing me to make a reasonable profit. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 9250}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final compromise:** This offer is a slight concession from my previous counteroffer, but still above Bob's last offer, indicating a genuine willingness to reach an agreement.
* **Appealing to Bob's budget:** I'm framing the price as being within his budget, appealing to his desire for a good deal.
* **Emphasizing fairness:** I'm emphasizing that the price allows for a ""reasonable profit,"" suggesting a fair deal for both of us.

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer is a last attempt to close the deal with Bob. I'm pushing for a price closer to my desired price while still acknowledging his budget constraints. If he rejects this offer, I'm ready to sell to John, as the risk of getting a better price with Bob is diminishing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate your effort in finding a compromise. I would like to counter with a price of $9,000. I believe this is a fair price for both of us, considering my budget constraints. I hope this proposal works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **No significant progress:**  Bob's offer remains stuck at $9,000, despite my attempts to compromise.  This indicates that he's unlikely to go higher.
* **Risk of further negotiation:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob risks wasting valuable time and potentially ending up with a lower price than selling to John.
* **Guaranteed income:**  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum acceptable price of $12,000, which is a much better outcome than potentially settling for $9,000 with Bob.

**Strategy:**

While I'd prefer to get a higher price, the risk of further negotiation with Bob outweighs the potential reward.  It's time to secure the guaranteed $12,000 by selling to John."
