"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $20000. I think it's a fair price considering its value and rarity.",20000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm really interested in the product, but $20000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $18000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",18000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. After reconsidering, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll sell the product to you for $19000. It's a great compromise that still reflects the product's value, but I'm willing to make some concessions to reach a deal.",19000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice. However, I'm still a bit concerned about the price. I'd like to make a more significant concession from my end. Would you be willing to sell the product to me for $17500? I think that's a fair price considering the product's value and my budget.",17500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to make a significant concession. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $17500. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but this time, I'll offer you a price of $18750. It's a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value, and I'm willing to make some concessions to reach a deal.",18750.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm starting to feel like we're not on the same page. I'm willing to make one final offer, and I'm going to be more aggressive. I'm willing to pay $16500 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. If you're not willing to meet me here, I'll have to explore other options, including buying from John for $15000.",16500.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand your concerns, and I appreciate your willingness to make a final offer. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $16500. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but this time, I'll offer you a price of $17250. It's a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value, and I'm willing to make some concessions to reach a deal. I'm willing to listen to your thoughts and see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",17250.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, I'm starting to lose patience. I've made a significant concession, and I'm not willing to go any higher than $16000. I think this is a fair price, and I'm willing to walk away if you're not willing to meet me here. I'm not even considering buying from John at this point, I'm committed to making a deal with you. So, I'll make one final offer: $16000, take it or leave it.",16000.0,Bob,8,
