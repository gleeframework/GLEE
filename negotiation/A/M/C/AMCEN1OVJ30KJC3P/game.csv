"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this unique product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm confident you'll love. I'm willing to let it go for $1200000. Is this within your budget?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the unique product, $1200000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $800000, which is the maximum I can afford at this time.  Let me know if this is a price you're open to discussing.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your honesty about your budget. However, $800000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so I'll make a counteroffer of $1000000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price for this unique product. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  While $1000000 is closer, it's still a bit out of reach for me. I'm prepared to go up to $900000. This is a significant increase from my initial offer, and I believe it reflects the value of the product. If you're open to it, let's finalize this deal.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to increase your offer. However, I'm still not quite convinced that $900000 is the best price for this product. I'm willing to meet you at $950000, which is a compromise between our previous offers. I think this is a fair price that reflects the product's value. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,5,
