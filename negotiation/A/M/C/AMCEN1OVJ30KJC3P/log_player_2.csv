Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your honesty about your budget. However, $800000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so I'll make a counteroffer of $1000000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price for this unique product. What do you think?
