"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for $11,500. This is a unique opportunity to acquire an item that holds significant value to me, and I believe it would be equally valuable to you given your interest in it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's still room for negotiation.  Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible, so rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer is the logical next step."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $11,500 is a bit above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product. This is a fair price considering your valuation and the value it holds for me. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and respect your valuation of the product. I am willing to consider your offer. However, I cannot agree to $10,500. I propose a counteroffer of $11,000. This is the highest price I can realistically consider, while still ensuring a fair return for myself. I hope this proposal works for you.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $11,000 is still a better deal than buying from John for $12,000.  While Bob could try to negotiate further, the risk of Alice rejecting his counteroffer and leaving him with only the option of John's higher price is too high.  Accepting Alice's offer saves Bob $1,000 compared to John."
