"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. As we've discussed, this product is truly worth $1,500,000 to you. I'm willing to make a one-time offer to you, and I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1,400,000. This is a fantastic deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better opportunity elsewhere. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still higher than John's price.  Here's why Bob should reject and how it might lead to a better outcome:

* **Leverage:** By rejecting Alice's offer, Bob signals that he knows the market and isn't desperate. This gives him leverage in further negotiations.
* **Alice's Motivation:** Alice is motivated to sell. Her product is worth less to her ($1,200,000) than what she's asking.  She's likely to make a counter-offer to avoid losing the sale.
* **John as a Backup:** Bob has John as a safety net. He's guaranteed to get the product for $1,500,000 if all else fails.

**Possible Outcomes After Rejection:**

1. **Alice lowers her price:** This is the ideal scenario.  She might offer a price closer to her own valuation, saving Bob even more.
2. **Stalemate:** Alice might not budge much. Bob can then decide if he wants to pay slightly more than John's price or go with his backup plan. 

**Important:** Bob should be prepared to walk away if Alice doesn't significantly lower her price."
