"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. As we've discussed, this product is truly worth $1,500,000 to you. I'm willing to make a one-time offer to you, and I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1,400,000. This is a fantastic deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better opportunity elsewhere. What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,1,
