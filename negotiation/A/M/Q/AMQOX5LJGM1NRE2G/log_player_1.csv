Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate the opportunity to acquire this product, the price of $2,300,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  Given my understanding of the product's value, I'm willing to offer $1,000,000.  This would allow us both to reach an agreeable agreement.

Bob's offer:

Bob's offer:

Bob is unlikely to go much higher and it's better to secure the guaranteed $1,500,000 from John than to risk Bob walking away."
