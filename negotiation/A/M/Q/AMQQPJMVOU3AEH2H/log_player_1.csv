Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its incredible value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth, and I'm confident it will be a wise investment for you."", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000,  you can afford to start with a significantly higher offer to Bob. This maximizes potential profit.
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes the ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""incredible value"" to justify the high price, appealing to Bob's potential desire for a unique product.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While the initial offer is high, it leaves space for Bob to negotiate. He might counter-offer, leading to a final price higher than your minimum.

**Important Note:** This strategy aims for the highest possible profit. However, a very high initial offer might make Bob completely disengage.  You'll need to assess Bob's personality and negotiation style to gauge the risk."
