Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your desire to make a strategic investment, but I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm proposing a counteroffer of $850,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's worth to you.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your position, Bob, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $800,000. Considering the value it holds for you, I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. I'm proposing a price of $875,000. This is the highest I'm willing to go, and I'm confident it's still a fair price considering the product's worth to you.

While I could try to negotiate further, Alice seems firm on her price, and $875,000 is a reasonable compromise. It avoids the risk of a stalemate and secures a significant discount from John's $1,200,000 offer."
