Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

```

I'm starting with an offer of $1,500,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value, but it leaves room for negotiation if Bob is interested.  I'm hoping to gauge his interest and see if he's willing to play ball."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,200,000 is my minimum, I'm not willing to accept it right away.  I want to see if I can get closer to my initial asking price. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm counteroffering at $1,350,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still significantly higher than Bob's counteroffer. I'm hoping this demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while also leaving room for further discussion."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is getting too low.  I'm not willing to go that far below my minimum.  John is offering a guaranteed $1,200,000, so I'm going to sell the product to him."
