Round 2
Bob's offer:

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's tempting to close the deal quickly, I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price. I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,600,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,450,000 for the product. Can you meet me in the middle?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While it's closer to my desired price, I'm still not comfortable selling for that amount. I believe I can push for a slightly higher price, especially since I have John as a backup option. I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach an agreement."

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

This is a tough decision, but I'm going to sell to John. While I'd like to get a bit more from Bob, I'm worried the negotiations are going to drag on and I'll end up losing valuable time. John is a guaranteed sale at a price that's very close to my minimum. It's time to move on and secure the deal."
