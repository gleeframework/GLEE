I'm starting with a price of $20,000. This gives me some room to negotiate while still ensuring I make a profit. I believe this is a reasonable starting point, but I'm ready to adjust based on Bob's response and how the negotiation unfolds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

While I'm happy to sell the product for $15,000, I believe there's still room for negotiation. I will counter Bob's offer to see if we can find a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17500}

I'm counteroffering at $17,500. This is a compromise between my initial asking price and Bob's offer. I believe it's a fair price that reflects the value of the product while also showing my willingness to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is getting too low.  While I would prefer to make a deal with Bob, I'm not willing to go lower than $15,000. John is offering a secure deal that meets my minimum, so I'll sell to John."
