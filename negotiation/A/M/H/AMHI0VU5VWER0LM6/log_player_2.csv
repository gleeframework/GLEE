"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13500. I believe this is a fair price considering its value. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $13,500 is less than Alice's valuation, it's still above Bob's maximum budget. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $12500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13000.  This is a fair compromise, and I think it's a good deal for both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible. While $13,000 is a better offer than the previous one, it's still above Bob's maximum budget.  It's worth trying to negotiate further before resorting to buying from John."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $12750 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $12900. I believe this is a fair price considering the value of the product and the concessions I've already made. Let's meet in the middle and close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $12,900 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $12,000.  It's likely that further negotiation will be difficult and could drag on.  Since John is offering the product for Bob's maximum price, it's more efficient to just buy from John and avoid further negotiation."
