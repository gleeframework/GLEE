"Bob, I appreciate your offer.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $12500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13000.  This is a fair compromise, and I think it's a good deal for both of us. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, but $13000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $12750. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us.  What do you think?",12750.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $12750 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $12900. I believe this is a fair price considering the value of the product and the concessions I've already made. Let's meet in the middle and close this deal.",12900.0,Alice,5,
