Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product. I'm asking for $150 for it. It's a great deal and I'm sure you'll love it! Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 150}

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $100. Can you consider it? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $100 is my minimum, I'm willing to try and get more.  Bob is clearly interested and I have 8 rounds left to try and negotiate a higher price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  While $100 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $125.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 125}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $125, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $115. Can you consider it? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting closer to my desired price.  Accepting his offer at $115 is a good compromise and secures a sale above my minimum. I also have limited rounds left, so it's better to close the deal now."
