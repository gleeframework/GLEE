"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $5,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $5,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  $5,000 is a great price, but there's a good chance Alice is willing to go lower. It's worth exploring that possibility."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 3000}
```

**Reasoning:**  I'm starting with a lower counteroffer to gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate. This price is still significantly less than my maximum of $15,000, leaving room for further bargaining."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $4,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $4,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice has come down to $4,000, which is a significant improvement from her initial offer. While I could try to negotiate further, there's a risk she might reject my next counteroffer and I could end up paying more.  It's a good deal considering my maximum price, and I don't want to risk losing the product altogether."
