"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a mutually beneficial deal. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  $12,000 is still above Bob's ideal price point, so rejecting the offer and counter-offering is the best strategy to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm looking to spend right now.  Would you be willing to consider $10,500?  That's a good starting point for us to potentially reach a deal."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, $10,500 is still a bit lower than my initial offer. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I get a fair price for the product. I'm willing to offer it to you for $11,500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming to save as much money as possible.  While $11,500 is lower than Alice's initial offer, it's still above Bob's ideal price.  He should continue to negotiate to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $11,500 is still a little high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $11,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product to both of us.  Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to accept $11,000 yet. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target price. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,250. This is my final offer, and I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial offer, it's still above Bob's ideal price point and close to the price he'd pay from John. It's worth another round of negotiation to see if Bob can push for a lower price before having to resort to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $12,250 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to pay $11,625.  This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 11625}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that we're close, Bob, but I'm not willing to give up any more ground. I'm willing to make one more offer, but I need to get closer to my target price. I'm willing to offer it to you for $13,000. This is my final offer, and I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product. If you're not willing to meet me here, I'll have to consider other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $13,000 is getting close to what Bob would pay John.  There are only three rounds left. Given the limited time and the fact that Alice is firm in her position, it's not worth the risk for Bob to continue negotiating. Buying from John at $15,000 is the most prudent decision at this point."
