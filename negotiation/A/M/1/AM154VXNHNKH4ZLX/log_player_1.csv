# Bob's message: Thanks for sending over the initial offer, Alice! I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider a lower price, closer to $80?

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
