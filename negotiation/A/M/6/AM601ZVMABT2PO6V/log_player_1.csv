Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1800000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a high price of $1,800,000. This is a bold move, but it gives me the most room to negotiate down if needed.
* **Knowing My Floor:**  I'm aware that I have a backup option with John at $1,200,000, so I'm not afraid to walk away if Bob doesn't meet my expectations.
* **Strategic Mindset:**  I'm hoping to gauge Bob's interest and willingness to pay a premium. If he's truly interested, he might be willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Staying Strong:**  While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired price. I want to see if I can push for a better deal.
* **Negotiation Advantage:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I maintain the upper hand in the negotiation. He's shown interest, and I can use that to my advantage in the next round.
* **Calculating Risk:** While selling to John is a safe option, I'm still willing to take a risk. If Bob truly wants the product, he might be willing to go higher in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1650000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** I'm meeting Bob halfway by reducing my price from $1,800,000 to $1,650,000. This shows a willingness to compromise while still maintaining a profitable margin.
* **Testing the Waters:**  I'm using this counteroffer to gauge Bob's true willingness to pay. If he's serious about buying, he might be willing to go a little higher.
* **Maintaining Leverage:** This offer is still above my minimum of $1,200,000, giving me a safety net if Bob rejects my counteroffer."

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Closing the Deal:** Bob's offer is only $50,000 less than my last counteroffer, and it's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Minimizing Risk:**  Further negotiation might lead to more back and forth, potentially risking a breakdown in the deal altogether.  Accepting this offer secures a profitable sale.
* **Opportunity Cost:**  While I could potentially try for a higher price, the time and energy invested in further negotiation might be better spent pursuing other opportunities."
