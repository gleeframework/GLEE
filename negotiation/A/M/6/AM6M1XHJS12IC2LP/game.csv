"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you're looking for a good deal. However, $1400000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1750000. This reflects the product's value and allows for some room for negotiation. I hope you'll consider this offer.",1750000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate the compromise, but $1750000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $1500000?",1500000.0,Bob,4,
