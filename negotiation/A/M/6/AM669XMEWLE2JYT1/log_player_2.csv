# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to get the best deal, Bob. However, I've already discounted the price by $180,000 from the original offer.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, Bob. However, I'm still not quite there. I can do $790,000, but I think that's the lowest I can go. I'm confident you'll find it's a fair price considering the product's value.

We've been going back and forth and Alice is unlikely to go much lower. Accepting at $790,000 is a reasonable deal and saves us $210,000 compared to John's offer."
