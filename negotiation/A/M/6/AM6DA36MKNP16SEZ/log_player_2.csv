# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. While $9,000 is a better price than John's $12,000, there's room for negotiation. Bob should reject the offer and try to get a better price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand that $9,000 might be a bit high for you. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $8,500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is $8,500**.  This is a good price for Bob, as it's significantly lower than John's offer of $12,000.
* **Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible**. While he could try to negotiate further, there's a risk Alice will reject his counteroffer, and he might end up paying even more than $8,500 or be forced to buy from John at $12,000.
* **Accepting Alice's offer is the most financially sound decision at this point**. It allows Bob to secure the product at a price he's comfortable with and avoid any potential risks of further negotiation."
