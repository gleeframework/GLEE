"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you a unique product that I believe would be highly valuable to you. Given its potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000.  I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,350,000 is less than your maximum budget, you know you have a backup option with John for $1,500,000. There's a chance you might be able to get a better price by rejecting Alice's offer and seeing if she'll come down."
