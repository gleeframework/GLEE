Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a unique product that I believe would be highly valuable to you. Given its potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000.  I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth."", 
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we know John provides a safety net at $1,000,000, the goal is to get the maximum Bob is willing to pay.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $1,350,000 allows for some negotiation downward if Bob tries to counter-offer. It's unlikely he'll accept the first price anyway.
* **Balance Risk and Reward:** There's a risk Bob will reject the offer outright if it's too high. This price aims to find a sweet spot between maximizing profit and securing the sale."
