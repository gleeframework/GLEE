**Reasoning:**

While Bob is moving closer to a potentially acceptable price, it's clear his absolute ceiling is significantly lower than our minimum ($1,000,000). Continuing to negotiate risks leaving money on the table. John offers a guaranteed sale at our minimum acceptable price. It makes the most business sense to take the guaranteed profit now."
