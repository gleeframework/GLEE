"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for $9500. This is a fantastic opportunity to acquire a valuable asset worth $10000 to you at a competitive price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's still room for negotiation.  Bob should aim for a lower price, potentially closer to Alice's value of $8,000.  A counteroffer will give Bob a chance to secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to spend closer to $8,500.  This product is worth $10,000 to me, and I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap."", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and would like to propose a price of $9000 for the product. This is a fair compromise considering its value to you and the competitive market rate. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $9,000, which is still a good deal for Bob.  It's $500 less than John's price, and closer to the target of saving as much money as possible.  Continuing to negotiate risks the deal falling through, and Bob may be forced to buy from John at a higher price.  Accepting Alice's offer is the most sensible choice at this point."
