"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic product that I believe would be incredibly valuable to you.  Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $950,000. I'm open to discussing this further, so please let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.** You're aiming to save as much money as possible, and $950,000 is still significantly above your ideal price. 
* **There's room for negotiation.**  Alice is clearly willing to negotiate, so you should try to lower the price.
* **John is a backup option.**  Knowing you have John as an alternative gives you leverage in the negotiation with Alice."

{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I see the value in the product,  $950,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Start with a significant counteroffer:** $850,000 is a significant reduction from Alice's $950,000 offer, demonstrating your seriousness about saving money. 
* **Maintain a professional tone:**  While firm, the message is polite and open to discussion, keeping the negotiation positive. 
* **Leave room for compromise:**  You haven't gone all the way down to your ideal price, giving Alice room to negotiate up a bit while still saving you money."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm confident that this product will exceed your expectations and bring significant value to your operations. To find a middle ground, I propose a price of $900,000.  This reflects the true worth of what I'm offering. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is still too high.**  While she has moved closer to your desired price, $900,000 is still more than you want to pay.
* **Negotiation is ongoing.**  Alice is showing flexibility, and you have room to push for a better price.
* **John is a safety net.**  Having John as an option gives you the confidence to keep negotiating with Alice.

**Next Steps:**

In the next round, you should make a counteroffer somewhere between your previous offer of $850,000 and Alice's current offer of $900,000.  Aim for a price that's closer to your ideal range, but leaves room for further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for coming down in price.  I appreciate your willingness to work with me.  $900,000 is still a bit high for me, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle.  How about we settle on $875,000?  This would be a fair price for both of us and allow us to finalize the deal."", ""product_price"": 875000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:**  This offer is the average of your previous offer ($850,000) and Alice's current offer ($900,000). It shows that you are willing to compromise.
* **Positive and persuasive:**  The message maintains a positive tone and emphasizes the benefits of reaching an agreement.
* **Leaves room for negotiation:**  While $875,000 is closer to your target, it still leaves a small margin for Alice to negotiate up slightly if necessary.

This counteroffer is designed to find a mutually acceptable price and finalize the deal without having to resort to John's offer."
