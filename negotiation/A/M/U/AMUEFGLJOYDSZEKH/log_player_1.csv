"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price of $120. It's a bit above what the product is worth to Bob, but I'm hoping to leave some room for negotiation. I'll see how Bob reacts before deciding whether to stick with this offer or lower it in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $90 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $100. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm lowering my price to $110. It's still above Bob's offer, but it shows I'm willing to negotiate. I'm hoping this will be a good middle ground for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $105 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $100. I'm willing to accept this offer and avoid further rounds of negotiation. It's a good deal for both of us."
