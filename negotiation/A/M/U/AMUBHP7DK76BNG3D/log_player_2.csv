"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you might be interested in. It's worth $10,000 to you, and I'm offering it to you for $11,000. This is a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

You're willing to pay a maximum of $10,000 for the product. Alice is offering it for $11,000, which is more than your limit. You can get the same product from John for $10,000, so it makes more sense to reject Alice's offer and buy from John."
