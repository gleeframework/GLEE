{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really love it. I'm asking for $100 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This is a starting point. I've chosen a price that is higher than my minimum, giving me room to negotiate.  The message is friendly and encourages Bob to think about the value of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for offering me the product. I'm interested, but I was hoping to get it for a bit less. Would you consider $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, I'm not willing to sell for that low just yet. I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price. I'll counteroffer and see where that leads."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I appreciate your interest.  $85 is a bit low for me right now. How about we split the difference and go with $92.50? "", ""product_price"": 92.50}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your response. I'm willing to pay $90 for the product. Is that within your range? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $90 is close enough to my desired price point.  It's more than what John would pay, and I'm happy to close the deal."
