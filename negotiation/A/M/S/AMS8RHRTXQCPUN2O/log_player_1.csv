Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and think you'd really appreciate it. I'm asking for $130, but I'm open to negotiation.  Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 130}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Offering $130 is a good starting point. It's a significant markup from my minimum value ($100) and leaves room for negotiation.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The message explicitly states I'm open to negotiation, signaling flexibility and encouraging Bob to counteroffer.
* **Value Proposition:** The message highlights the product's value, subtly reminding Bob of its worth to him. 

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts: I've made a good profit!
* If Bob rejects: I'll carefully analyze his counteroffer, considering his willingness to pay and the potential of making a better deal with John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! That product looks great, but $130 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  While $100 is my minimum acceptable price, I'm not desperate to sell at that price. I believe there's still room for negotiation with Bob. 
* **Potential for a better deal:**  I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price of $130, especially since Bob is clearly interested.
* **Avoiding John:**  Selling to John would secure a guaranteed $100, but it wouldn't maximize my potential earnings. 

**Next Steps:**

I will send Bob a counteroffer, aiming for a price closer to $130, but potentially lower than my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position.  $100 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $115?  That's a fair compromise and gives us both a good deal.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 115}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-offer with compromise:**  I'm adjusting my offer to $115, which is lower than my initial $130 but still higher than Bob's offer. This shows flexibility while maintaining a profitable margin for myself.
* **Emphasis on fairness:**  The message stresses the ""fair compromise"" aspect, aiming to appeal to Bob's sense of equity and encourage him to accept.
* **Continued negotiation:**  I'm keeping the door open for further negotiations by asking for Bob's thoughts. 

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts: I've secured a good price and successfully negotiated a deal.
* If Bob rejects: I'll analyze his counteroffer and decide whether to continue negotiating with him or sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $115 is closer, but I'm aiming for something under $110.  Would you do $105? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Closing the Deal:** Bob's offer of $105 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $100.  Continuing to negotiate might lead to further concessions and a lower price, risking a stalemate or a deal with John for the same price.
* **Profit Maximization:**  While $105 isn't ideal, it still represents a $5 profit over my minimum and allows me to close the deal.
* **Time and Effort:**  Continuing to negotiate would require more time and effort, which could be better spent pursuing other opportunities. 

**Next Steps:**

I've successfully negotiated a sale with Bob, maximizing my profit given his counteroffer and my desire to avoid further negotiation."
