Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. I believe it would be extremely valuable to you. I'm asking for $11,600. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11600} 

This strategy starts with a strong initial offer just below my minimum. This leaves room for negotiation while still aiming for a price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value.  I want to appear enthusiastic and highlight the product's value to Bob, encouraging him to engage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am only able to pay up to $10,000 for it. Would you be willing to accommodate my budget? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is his maximum perceived value, leaving no room for further negotiation upwards from that point. I know I can get $12,000 from John, so accepting $10,000 is not optimal. I need to incentivize Bob to move closer to my price range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $11,600 is already a very competitive price for what this product offers. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $11,200. This is my final offer."", ""product_price"": 11200}

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise (Slightly):**  I am showing a willingness to negotiate by lowering the price, but not by a significant amount. This signals I'm trying to be fair but still value the product highly.
* **Finality:** By stating this is my final offer, I create a sense of urgency and encourage Bob to make a decision. 
* **Alternative:**  I am keeping John ($12,000) in mind as a backup plan if Bob remains unwilling to budge."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my budget, Alice. I appreciate the flexibility shown. However, I am still unable to meet at $11,200. Could we possibly negotiate down to $10,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Minimal Gain:** Bob's offer of $10,500 is only a small increase from his previous offer. It's unlikely he'll move significantly closer to my desired price.
* **Guaranteed Sale:** John offers a guaranteed $12,000, which is a better deal than the current trajectory with Bob.
* **Time Cost:**  Further negotiation with Bob could be lengthy with minimal returns. Accepting John's offer provides an immediate and favorable outcome."
