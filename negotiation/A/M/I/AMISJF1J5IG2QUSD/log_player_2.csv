# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a unique and valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's worth to you.

Alice's offer of $900,000 is a good starting point, but I can likely get a better deal. I'm willing to negotiate further."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $800,000.  It's still a great deal for you, considering your value of $1,000,000, and it allows me to stay within my budget."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $800,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $850,000. This is a reasonable compromise considering the product's value to you and the value I place on it.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting closer to my desired price, but $850,000 is still above my target. I'm going to counteroffer again and see if we can reach a deal. I still have plenty of rounds left to negotiate."

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your willingness to compromise, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $825,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $875,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the value I place on it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is now offering $875,000. This is still above my ideal price point of $800,000, but it's getting closer.  While I could continue to counteroffer, I'm concerned about running out of time and having to buy from John at a much higher price.  Accepting Alice's offer ensures I get the product within my budget and before the deadline."
