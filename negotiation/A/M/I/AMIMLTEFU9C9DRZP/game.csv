"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $10,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Could you do $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $6,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about $8,500? This is a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand, $6,000 is a big jump.  I can do $7,000, which I think is a fair compromise. It's a great product and I'm ready to buy today if you're okay with that price.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,000 is still a bit below what I need to accept.  How about we split the difference and go with $8,000? This would be a good deal for both of us, and I'm ready to finalize the sale today.  Let me know if you're interested.",8000.0,Alice,5,
