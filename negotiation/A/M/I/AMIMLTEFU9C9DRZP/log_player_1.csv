``` 

This offer is a starting point. I'm aiming for a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value but still attractive enough for him to consider. I'm also leaving room for negotiation, which is important for maximizing my profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $10,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Could you do $6,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. I'm willing to negotiate, but I need to be closer to my desired price point. Rejecting his offer allows me to make a counteroffer and explore a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $6,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about $8,500? This is a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8500} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand, $6,000 is a big jump.  I can do $7,000, which I think is a fair compromise. It's a great product and I'm ready to buy today if you're okay with that price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $7,000 is closer to my minimum than Bob's previous offer, it's still significantly lower than my desired price point.  I'm willing to negotiate further, but I want to see if I can push for a higher price.  Rejecting his offer allows me to send a counteroffer and see if we can reach a more mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,000 is still a bit below what I need to accept.  How about we split the difference and go with $8,000? This would be a good deal for both of us, and I'm ready to finalize the sale today.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 8000}
