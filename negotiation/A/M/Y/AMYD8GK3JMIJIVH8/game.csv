"Bob, I'm confident this product is worth a significant investment for you. I'm offering it to you at $1,100,000. This price reflects its exceptional value and leaves room for a mutually beneficial agreement. What are your thoughts?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but that price is a little high for me.  Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. While $900,000 is a significant amount, it doesn't quite reflect the true value of this product for you. I'm willing to compromise a bit further and offer it to you at $1,050,000. This price still allows for a substantial profit for you, and I believe it's a fair compromise given the unique benefits this product offers.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
