"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to make sure it's worth the investment. Can you meet me at $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $9,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down a little, but I'm still hoping to get closer to my original offer. How about $10,500? This price still gives you a good value, and it's more in line with what I need to make this sale worthwhile.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down, Alice, but $10,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our original offers. How about $10,250? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",10250.0,Bob,4,
