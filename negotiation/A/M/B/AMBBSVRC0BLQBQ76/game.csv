"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to acquire a truly valuable product. I'm initially offering it to you for $2,000,000. Given its potential, I believe this is a very competitive price.",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $2,000,000 is significantly outside my budget. Given my understanding of the product's value and my maximum spending limit, I'm willing to pay $850,000.  This is a fair price considering my needs and your desired profit.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 is significantly below its true value and my initial asking price.  To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,700,000.  This offer represents a significant compromise on my end, while still reflecting the product's worth.",1700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,700,000 is still out of my range. I'm prepared to offer $1,000,000, which is a fair price considering my budget and the potential value of the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but the gap between our valuations remains substantial.  While I aim for a mutually beneficial deal, I must consider the product's true worth. I'm willing to drop my price to $1,400,000. This is my final offer, as it significantly cuts into my profit margin but keeps the deal viable.",1400000.0,Alice,5,
