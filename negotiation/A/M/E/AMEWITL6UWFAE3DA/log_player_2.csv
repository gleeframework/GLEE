Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're looking to save some money, but $120 is still a bit below my minimum. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $160. Would you be willing to go up to that price?

While $160 is closer to your budget, it's still more than you're willing to pay. You should reject this offer and try to negotiate further."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal. I can do $155, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. Is $155 a price you'd be comfortable with? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $155. 
You have three options:

Alice is still asking for more than your budget, and while it's getting closer, it's still not worth it to you. It's better to buy from John for $100 and save yourself some money."
