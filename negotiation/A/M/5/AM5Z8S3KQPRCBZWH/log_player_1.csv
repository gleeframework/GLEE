Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$11,000:** This is a starting point that allows for some negotiation space while still ensuring a profit for me. 
* **The message:**  This is friendly and emphasizes the value of the product to Bob, making the offer more appealing.

**Why this strategy:**

* **Maximizing profit:** I want to get as close to Bob's $10,000 valuation as possible without going below my minimum.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** The initial offer gives Bob room to counter, which can lead to a mutually agreeable price.
* **Plan B:**  The threat of selling to John for $10,000 gives me leverage if Bob is unwilling to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the value of the product,  $11,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending.  I'm happy to buy it for $9,500.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, I'm not ready to settle just yet. I believe I can still get a better price. Rejecting his offer allows me to counter with a higher price, hopefully closer to my desired $11,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite there yet.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500.  This is still a good deal for you, considering the value of the product. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 10500}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** This counteroffer is a compromise, halfway between my previous offer of $11,000 and Bob's offer of $9,500.
* **Maintaining leverage:**  By not accepting Bob's offer immediately, I show that I'm confident in the product's value and willing to walk away if necessary. 
* **Positive messaging:**  The message remains friendly and emphasizes the value proposition for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $10,500 is still a little more than I'm hoping to spend.  I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product.  This is my final offer, and if it doesn't work for you, I'll need to go with John's offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $10,000 is my minimum acceptable price.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial $11,000 target, Bob's ""final offer"" and the threat to go with John's offer means I have to accept.  This is the best outcome given the current circumstances."
