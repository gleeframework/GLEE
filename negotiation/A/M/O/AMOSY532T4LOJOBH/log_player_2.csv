"Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Since Alice's offer is $18,000, which is more than Bob's maximum budget of $15,000, it's best to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob is aiming to save as much money as possible while still acquiring the product. He offers $14,000, which is $1,000 less than his maximum budget, leaving room for potential negotiation. This initial counteroffer shows Alice that Bob is serious about buying the product but is also willing to push for a lower price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer of $16,500 is closer to Bob's maximum budget, it's still higher. Bob should reject this offer and try to negotiate a lower price. There's still room to go down in the negotiation without exceeding his budget, and buying from John for $15,000 remains a viable alternative."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 15500}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is getting closer to his maximum budget. He offers $15,500, which is only $500 more than John's offer. This shows Alice that he is serious about acquiring the product but is still trying to secure a better price than John's. This counteroffer creates a sense of urgency and incentivizes Alice to consider accepting it, as she might not get a better offer from Bob."
