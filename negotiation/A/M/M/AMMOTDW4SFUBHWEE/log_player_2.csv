"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a unique opportunity for you to acquire something truly special. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,000,000. I think this is a fair price considering its worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,000,000 is a good starting point, but I can likely get a better deal.  It's worth exploring if I can get the price lower before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate you're willing to negotiate. While I see the value in this product, $1,000,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to offer $850,000.  This is a fair price given the value you've mentioned, and it gives us both some room to work with."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $925,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the market demand. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $925,000 is closer to my desired price, but I still believe I can do better. I'm not ready to buy from John yet, so I'll continue negotiating with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. While $925,000 is closer, it's still a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to offer $900,000. This is a fair compromise that allows us both to get a good deal. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $900,000 is a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as that. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer $950,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great value for the product. Let's see if we can meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $950,000, which is a good price considering her original asking price and my budget.  While I can continue to negotiate, there's a risk that she'll walk away and I'll have to buy from John at a much higher price.  Accepting this offer guarantees I get the product for a reasonable price."
