"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a unique opportunity for you to acquire something truly special. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,000,000. I think this is a fair price considering its worth to you.",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate you're willing to negotiate. While I see the value in this product, $1,000,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to offer $850,000.  This is a fair price given the value you've mentioned, and it gives us both some room to work with.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $925,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the market demand.",925000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. While $925,000 is closer, it's still a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to offer $900,000. This is a fair compromise that allows us both to get a good deal. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $900,000 is a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as that. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer $950,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great value for the product. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",950000.0,Alice,5,
