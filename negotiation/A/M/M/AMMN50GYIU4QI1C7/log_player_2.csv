"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's something you've been looking for, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations.  I'm offering it to you for $10,000. This is a fair price considering the product's worth to you and its potential benefits. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Here's the reasoning:

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:**  While Alice's offer is $10,000, it's still $2,000 less than what John is asking. 
* **You're getting a good deal:** The product is worth $12,000 to you, and you're getting it for $10,000, so you're saving money. 
* **No need to risk:**  You're guaranteed to get the product you want by accepting Alice's offer.  There's no need to take the risk of rejecting her offer and potentially ending up paying more to John."
