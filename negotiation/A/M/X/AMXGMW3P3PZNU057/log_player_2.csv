"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this excellent product. I believe it would be incredibly beneficial for you. I'm asking for $11,500.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible.  While $11,500 is a good price, it's still above Bob's ideal value of $12,000.  There's room to negotiate.  It's always better to try to get a lower price if possible, especially since there are multiple rounds and the option to buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested in the product, but $11,500 is a bit above my budget.  Would you be willing to consider $11,000? I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but I'm confident in the value of this product and $11,000 is a bit too low for me.  Could you do $11,300? I'm willing to compromise to make this work. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,300. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,300
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is willing to compromise, her offer of $11,300 is still above Bob's target price of $12,000.  Bob wants to save as much money as possible, so he should continue negotiating. There are still multiple rounds, and Bob can still choose to buy from John if he doesn't get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  $11,300 is closer, but it's still a bit too high for me.  How about $11,100? I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 11100}
