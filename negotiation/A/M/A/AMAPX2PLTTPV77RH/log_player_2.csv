"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $800,000. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested, but $1,000,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $650,000?"", ""product_price"": 650000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest but $650,000 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This still gives you a good deal, and it's closer to what I need. Let's find a middle ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you're looking for a fair price. How about we meet in the middle at $750,000? This would be a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 750000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $750,000 is still too low. How about we split the difference and go with $850,000? That would be a good deal for both of us, and it would allow us to close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

While Alice is showing a willingness to negotiate, she's still significantly above your backup option. At this point, it's unlikely she'll go as low as $800,000. You're better off taking the guaranteed deal from John."
