Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but your initial price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $800,000.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the product's value, but I have budget constraints. I could stretch to $950,000. That's a significant increase from my previous offer and shows how serious I am about this. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000

**Reasoning:** We're still significantly below what John is offering.  Bob is clearly interested and willing to negotiate, so there's room to push further."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you moving closer to the value. To be frank, I have another buyer interested at a lower price point. However, I believe you'd get more out of this product, so I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000.  This is my final offer."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for being upfront. I understand your position. While $1,150,000 is still a bit steep for me, I'm willing to make a significant move. How about $1,025,000?  That's a substantial jump on my end and shows I'm serious about closing this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000.
