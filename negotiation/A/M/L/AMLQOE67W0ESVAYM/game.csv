"I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire something valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $18,000.",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you see in this product, $18,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for it. Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $12,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $16,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $16,000 is still a little outside of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $13,500. This is a significant increase from my previous offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise.",13500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $13,500. I'm willing to make one more concession and meet you at $14,500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",14500.0,Alice,5,
