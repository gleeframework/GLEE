"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $950,000 is a good price, Bob can potentially get a better deal by negotiating. He's willing to pay up to $1,000,000, so there's room for a counteroffer.  Rejecting the initial offer allows Bob to start the negotiation process and potentially secure a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $850,000 is still significantly below what I need to make this deal work. How about we meet in the middle at $900,000? This price is still a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price. What do you say?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is a better price than the initial offer, Bob can still try to negotiate a lower price. He has a clear goal of paying no more than $1,000,000, so there's still room to negotiate. Rejecting this offer allows Bob to continue the bargaining process and potentially secure a price closer to his target."
