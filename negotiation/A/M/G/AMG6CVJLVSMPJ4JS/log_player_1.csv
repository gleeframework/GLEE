Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,150,000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price that's above my minimum but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Appealing to Bob's interest:**  I'm highlighting the value the product holds for Bob to make the offer more enticing. 
* **Leaving room for counteroffers:**  I'm not going for the full $1,200,000 right away, as it's likely Bob will counteroffer. 
* **Knowing my fallback:**  I'm comfortable with the John offer, so I'm not afraid to walk away if Bob isn't willing to meet my price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,150,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000.  This is a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:** While it's closer to my minimum of $1,000,000, it's still below the $1,050,000 I'm willing to accept. 
* **I have leverage:** I have a fallback option with John, and I'm confident I can get a better price from Bob through further negotiation. 
* **Counteroffers are part of the game:** This is a negotiation, and counteroffers are expected. I'm prepared to continue the process to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $1,050,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a price we can both be happy with. Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm demonstrating flexibility by coming down from my initial offer, but I'm still holding out for a price closer to my target.
* **Appeal to fairness:** I'm framing the offer as a ""fair compromise"" to appeal to Bob's sense of reason. 
* **Positive framing:** I'm emphasizing the possibility of closing the deal to encourage Bob to accept. 
* **Staying above my minimum:**  I'm still above my minimum of $1,000,000, ensuring I get a good return on my product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like, but I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,075,000. This is a fair compromise that gives us both some room to be satisfied.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** Bob's offer is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While I could try to squeeze out another $25,000, there's a risk that Bob will walk away, forcing me to sell to John for less.
* **Time is money:**  Continuing the negotiation could take more time and effort, potentially delaying the sale and the profits.

Given these factors, it's more strategic to accept Bob's offer and secure the sale at a price that's still reasonable for me."
