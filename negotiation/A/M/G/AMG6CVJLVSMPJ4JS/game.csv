"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,150,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000.  This is a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $1,050,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a price we can both be happy with. Let's see if we can close this deal.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like, but I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,075,000. This is a fair compromise that gives us both some room to be satisfied.  What do you think?",1075000.0,Bob,4,
