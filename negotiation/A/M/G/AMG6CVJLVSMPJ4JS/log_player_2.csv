It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price with Alice before resorting to buying from John."

This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a price we can both be happy with. Let's see if we can close this deal.

You're still saving $100,000 by buying from Alice even at $1,100,000.  It's worth trying to counter-offer again to see if you can get closer to your target price."
