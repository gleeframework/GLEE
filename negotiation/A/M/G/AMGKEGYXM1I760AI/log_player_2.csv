Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has lowered her price slightly from the previous round, but it's still above Bob's target.  However, with only 3 rounds left, the risk of going to John and paying a higher price is becoming increasingly significant. Accepting this offer will ensure Bob gets the product, albeit at a slightly higher price than he initially hoped for.  The negotiation has been lengthy, and further rounds might not result in a significantly lower price.  It's a pragmatic decision to accept the offer and finalize the deal."
