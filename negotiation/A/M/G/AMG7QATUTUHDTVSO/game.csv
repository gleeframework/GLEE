"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $11,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product.  Let me know if that works for you.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,000. It's still a great price for you, considering what the product is worth.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",11000.0,Alice,3,
