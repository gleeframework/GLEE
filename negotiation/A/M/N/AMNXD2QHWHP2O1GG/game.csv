"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your product, but I am looking to stay within my budget of $80. Would you consider selling it for $100?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price. How about $135?  It's still a good deal for you, and I think you'll be very happy with the product.",135.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, I understand your position, but I am still aiming to keep my expenses within my budget. Could we perhaps meet somewhere in the middle at $120?",120.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I hear you, but $120 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm really trying to work with you here.  Would you consider $140?  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.  Let's try to make this happen!",140.0,Alice,5,
