"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product I think you'd be interested in. It's valued at over $100 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $120. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is exactly your maximum price. You can get the same product from John for the same price. There's no benefit to accepting Alice's offer.  Rejecting allows you to potentially negotiate with Alice or find a better deal elsewhere."
