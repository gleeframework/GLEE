"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

I'm starting high, aiming for a price closer to my value.  Since I can always sell to John for $1,500,000, I'm leaving room to negotiate down if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to his value, it's still significantly lower than my minimum. I want to see if I can push him higher with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly, but still aiming for a price closer to my value. This shows some flexibility while also indicating I'm not willing to go too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm still going to reject Bob's offer.  While it's a little higher than his previous offer, it's still too low for me.  I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000} 
```

I'm lowering my price again, but this time, it's to my minimum acceptable price.  I'm leaving no room for further concessions unless Bob comes up significantly higher.  I'm also getting closer to the halfway point of our valuations.  This should make him consider accepting."
