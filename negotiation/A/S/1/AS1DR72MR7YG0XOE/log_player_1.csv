Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. I know it's a valuable asset to you, and I believe this price reflects its true worth. I'm open to negotiation, but I'm confident this is a fair starting point."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I believe the product's value is lower than $1200000. I'm willing to pay $900000 for it. I'm open to further negotiation, but I'd like to see some movement from your end. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While selling to John for $1,000,000 is tempting, I want to see if I can squeeze a bit more out of Bob. He's already shown some interest by making a counteroffer, and I believe I can get closer to my desired price with further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective. While I value your interest, $900,000 is unfortunately below what I can accept at this time. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let's agree on $1,050,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows for a profitable transaction for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. While I understand your perspective, I still believe the product's value is lower than $1050000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $975000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $975,000 is tempting, I'm still confident I can get closer to my goal of $1,000,000. Bob has shown a willingness to negotiate, and I believe another round of counteroffers might yield a more favorable outcome. Selling to John is always an option, but I want to explore all possibilities with Bob before making that final decision."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $975,000 is a step in the right direction, it's still not quite where I need to be. Let's split the difference and settle on $1,012,500. This price is fair for both of us and allows for a successful transaction. I'm confident we can reach an agreement that benefits both parties."", ""product_price"": 1012500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer $990000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value, and I'm willing to walk away if we can't agree on this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $990,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $990,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $990,000 is getting close to my goal, I'm running out of time and don't want to risk losing the sale altogether.  John's offer of $1,000,000 is a guaranteed profit and the safest option at this point.  It's time to cut my losses and secure the deal."
