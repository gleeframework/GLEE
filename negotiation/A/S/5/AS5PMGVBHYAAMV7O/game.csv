"I'm interested in the product, but I think $2000000 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1800000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",1800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer.  While I'm open to negotiation, $1800000 is still a bit low for me.  Let's split the difference - how about $1900000? This reflects the product's value and gives you a good deal.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're looking for a good deal, but $1900000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll make a counteroffer of $1700000. Can you consider that?",1700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $1700000 is simply too low for me. Considering the value of this product, I'm willing to go down to $1850000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a deal you can't refuse. Let's finalize this and make it happen.",1850000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground, but $1850000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'll make a counteroffer of $1750000. Can you consider that?",1750000.0,Bob,6,
