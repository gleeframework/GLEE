"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000.  It's a great deal, and I'm confident it's a price we can both be happy with.  Let me know what you think.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $1,400,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $1,050,000?",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints.  However, $1,050,000 is significantly below my minimum asking price.  I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000, which still gives us both room for profit. Let me know if you're interested in this revised offer.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $1,250,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something below $1,200,000.  Would you be willing to meet me at $1,150,000?",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,150,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to compromise further and meet you at $1,180,000. This is a fair price that allows both of us to achieve our objectives.  What do you say?",1180000.0,Alice,5,
