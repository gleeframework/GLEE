"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product. It's worth at least $120 to me, so I'm offering it to you for $130. What do you think?",130.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe I can find the product elsewhere for a lower price. I am willing to pay $110 for it. Let me know if this works for you.",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $110 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $115?  That's a fair compromise, considering the value of this product.",115.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I still feel that $115 is a bit steep given my budget constraints. I would like to propose $105 as a counteroffer. This is a price that aligns better with what I'm willing to spend while still being fair to both of us.",105.0,Bob,4,
