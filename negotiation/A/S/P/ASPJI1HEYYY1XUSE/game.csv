"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, considering the value I see in the product. Can you consider my offer?",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $9,500 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway on the difference. How about we settle on $10,750?  This would give us both a good deal.",10750.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your willingness to meet me halfway, but $10,750 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $10,200, but that's as high as I can go. Can you consider this offer?",10200.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,200 is still a bit below what I'm looking for. To make this work for both of us, I'm willing to go down to $10,500. This is a fair compromise, and it allows us to close the deal. What do you say?",10500.0,Alice,5,
