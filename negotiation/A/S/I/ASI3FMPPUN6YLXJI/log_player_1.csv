Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value and the potential I see for you, I'm willing to offer it at $10,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 10000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** While I have a guaranteed sale at $12,000, selling to Bob first at a higher price could be more profitable.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $10,000 creates a win-win situation:
    * Bob gets the product for $2,000 less than its worth to him.
    * I make $2,000 more than selling to John.
* **First-Refusal Incentive:** Highlighting that Bob has a limited-time offer before a public listing creates a sense of urgency and exclusivity, making him more likely to accept."
