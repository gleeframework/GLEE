"Thanks Alice, but $10,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'd be willing to pay $8,500 for it.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,500, which is still a good price for a product worth much more.  Let's try to make this work.",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $9,500 is still a bit high for me.  How about $9,000? That would be a fair price for both of us.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but I'm not quite there yet.  $9,250 is my final offer.  It's a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you say?",9250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $9,250 is still a bit too much for me.  I'm willing to go up to $9,100. If you can't do that, I'll have to go with another offer.",9100.0,Bob,6,
