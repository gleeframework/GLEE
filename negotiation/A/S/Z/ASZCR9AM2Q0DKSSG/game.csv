,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to go that low. How about we split the difference and settle on $1,050,000? This price still leaves you with a substantial profit while allowing me to reach a more acceptable figure.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above $1,050,000. How about we meet in the middle at $1,050,000 is too high for me, so I'll go a bit lower, $975,000?",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to negotiate, but $975,000 just doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,025,000. This price still allows for a significant profit for you while getting me closer to my target.  Let's finalize this deal.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,025,000 is still a bit above my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about we try $987,500?",987500.0,Bob,6,
