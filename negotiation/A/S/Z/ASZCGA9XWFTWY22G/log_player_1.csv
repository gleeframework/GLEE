Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting with a high price, aiming for a good profit.  Since I don't know Bob's valuation, I'm hoping to get a good counteroffer. I'll be ready to negotiate from there, but I'll always keep John's offer of $800,000 as my safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While it's closer to my goal, I still believe I can get a better price. I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can meet in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000} 
```

I'm offering a price that's halfway between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. This shows that I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm still confident that the product is worth more than $900,000.  I'm hopeful that Bob will accept this offer, but if not, I'll be ready to consider further negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob has come up a bit, and I'm willing to close the deal at $920,000. It's a good price, and it's better than selling to John.  I'm confident that this is a win for both of us."
