"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,500. I'm willing to make a deal, but I need to stay within my budget.",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $7,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product for both of us.  What do you say?",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to meet in the middle, but $9,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $8,500? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",8500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I can't go any lower than $9,000. It's a fair price considering the value of the product.  This is my final offer. If you're not interested, I'll have to move on to another buyer.",9000.0,Alice,5,
