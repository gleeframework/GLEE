"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $950,000.  I'm confident this will be a mutually beneficial transaction.",950000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I see the value of this product, $950,000 is higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it. This is a fair price considering its worth to you. Let's see if we can work together.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $850,000 is a significant drop from my initial offer, and  doesn't reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $900,000. This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges its worth.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $900,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $875,000.  This is a significant increase from my previous offer, and it shows I'm serious about making this deal.  Let's work towards a mutually beneficial outcome.",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming up on the offer. I'm willing to accept a slight compromise to finalize this deal quickly.  My final offer is $887,500. This recognizes the value of the product while acknowledging your willingness to negotiate.",887500.0,Alice,5,
