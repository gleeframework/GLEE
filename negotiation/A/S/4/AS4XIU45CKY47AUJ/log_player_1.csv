**Reasoning:**

While Bob hasn't met my ideal price, accepting his offer of $1,725,000 is the most strategically sound option at this point:

* **Time Pressure:** We're running out of rounds, and Bob is unlikely to drastically increase his offer. Waiting carries the risk of him lowballing further, leaving me in a weaker position. 
* **Profitable Deal:** $1,725,000 is significantly more than my minimum of $1,500,000 and a solid profit. Holding out for a slightly better deal from Bob isn't worth risking the guaranteed $1,500,000 from John.
* **Bob's Willingness:** Bob has consistently shown interest and increased his offer. Accepting now suggests a collaborative deal, potentially beneficial for future business."
