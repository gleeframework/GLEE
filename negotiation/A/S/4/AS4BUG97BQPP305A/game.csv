"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement.

"Alice, your offer is a good start, but I'm looking to save as much as possible. I'm willing to offer you $950,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to you and the fact that I'm still willing to buy it.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was hoping to get closer to the value you place on the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the value it holds for me.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,050,000 is still above what I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to both of us. Let's find a middle ground and close this deal.",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $1,000,000. Considering the value you place on the product and the fact that we're getting close to the deadline, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm counteroffering at $1,075,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to both of us.",1075000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $1,075,000. However, I'm willing to make a slight concession to meet you in the middle. I'm counteroffering at $1,062,500. This is the best I can do, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to both of us.",1062500.0,Alice,7,

"I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $1,062,500. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to be closer to my minimum price. I'm counteroffering at $1,060,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to both of us.",1060000.0,Alice,9,
