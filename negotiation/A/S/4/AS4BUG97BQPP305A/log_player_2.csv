"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,100,000, which is a fair price considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high.  It's better to try and negotiate a lower price. There's room for a better deal before considering John's offer."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your offer is a good start, but I'm looking to save as much as possible. I'm willing to offer you $950,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to you and the fact that I'm still willing to buy it."", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was hoping to get closer to the value you place on the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the value it holds for me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high. While it's closer to my ideal price, I want to keep negotiating to see if I can get it lower. There's still room to bargain, and I'm not willing to commit to John's price just yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,050,000 is still above what I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $1,000,000. Considering the value you place on the product and the fact that we're getting close to the deadline, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm counteroffering at $1,075,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is getting closer to my target price, $1,075,000 is still too high. I believe we can reach a more favorable agreement with a little more negotiation.  I want to see if I can push her down to $1,025,000 before I seriously consider John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6

I want to see if I can get her down to $1,050,000 before I seriously consider John's offer.  There are still a few rounds left, and I want to maximize my savings."

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but I'm still hoping for a better price. I'm willing to offer $1,050,000 for the product.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $1,062,500. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to be closer to my minimum price. I'm counteroffering at $1,060,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,060,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,060,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,060,000 is very close to my ideal price and only slightly higher than my last counteroffer. With only one round left, the risk of further negotiation is too high.  It's likely that Alice won't budge further, and I could end up with John's price of $1,200,000.  Accepting this offer saves me $140,000 compared to John's offer."
