Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering its worth. Let me know your thoughts, and we can go from there."", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Anchor Point:** Starting with a price closer to your minimum ($1,500,000) sets a strong anchor point. Even though it's above Bob's perceived value, it frames the negotiation from a position of strength.
* **Room for Negotiation:**  The offer leaves space for Bob to negotiate down. This allows him to feel involved in the process and potentially reach a price that's still very favorable to you. 
* **Balancing Risk and Reward:** There's a risk Bob will reject the offer outright. However, the potential reward of securing a significantly higher price than John's offer makes this calculated risk worthwhile. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Perspective:**  While you know John will pay $1,500,000, Bob is unaware of this backup offer. Your negotiation strategy needs to account for Bob's potential perception of the product's value.
* **Relationship Building:** Even though your goal is to maximize profit, consider the long-term implications. A collaborative and respectful negotiation can potentially lead to future business opportunities."
