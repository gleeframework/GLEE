"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree this product has value, I think $1,300,000 is a bit high.  Would you consider $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer you a counteroffer of $1,150,000. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's worth to you.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thanks for the counteroffer.  I appreciate you coming down, but $1,150,000 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we settle at $1,075,000? ",1075000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $1,075,000. Considering our previous offers, I'm willing to make a slight adjustment. I'll offer you a counteroffer of $1,125,000. This is a reasonable price that still reflects the product's value to you, and I believe it's a fair compromise.",1125000.0,Alice,5,
