# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it.

It seems Alice is stuck at $1,125,000.  It's unlikely she'll go much lower, and it's not worth the risk of continuing the negotiation. You can get the product for a sure $1,200,000 from John."
