Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, $9,500 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'll offer it to you for $14,000. This is my final offer, so let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000.

Alice is very unlikely to go below $10,000.  It's not worth further negotiation.  Buying from John ensures you get the product at your target price."
