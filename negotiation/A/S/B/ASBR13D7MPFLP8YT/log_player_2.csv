"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am delighted to present you with an extraordinary opportunity to acquire a unique product that I believe would significantly enhance your endeavors. This product holds immense value to me, but recognizing its potential worth to others, I am extending this exclusive offer to you. Given its significance and the benefits it could bring to you, I propose to sell the product to you for $1200000. I am confident that this price reflects not only the product's intrinsic value but also offers a reasonable profit margin for me. I look forward to discussing this further and exploring how we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. Kind regards, Alice 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is higher than Bob's maximum budget of $1,000,000.  While the product is worth $1,500,000 to Alice, Bob can get the same product from John for $1,000,000.  Therefore, rejecting Alice's offer and buying from John is the best option for Bob."
