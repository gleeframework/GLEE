"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident it'll be worth more than that to you. Let's talk!",12000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Can we meet in the middle at $10,500?",10050.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,050 isn't quite where I need to be.  How about we split the difference and meet at $11,000? That's still a great deal for you, and it gives me a bit more wiggle room.  Let's make this happen!",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, Alice, but I'm still a bit far from my target. I'm willing to go up to $9,500, but I don't think I can go any higher. Can you consider that?",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have a limit, but $9,500 just isn't enough for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500, which is a fair compromise.  It's still a great price for the value you'll get from this product, and it gets us closer to a deal.  Let's make this happen!",10500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but $10,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,500 and $10,500, which would be $10,000. Can you consider that?",10000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,000 just isn't going to work for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,250, which is a fair compromise considering the value of this product.  Let's find a way to make this happen. What do you say?",10250.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $10,250 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $9,750, but I don't think I can go any higher. Can you consider that?",9750.0,Bob,8,
