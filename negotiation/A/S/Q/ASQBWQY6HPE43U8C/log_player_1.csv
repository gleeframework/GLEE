Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I've got a great product for you that I think you'll really appreciate.  I'm offering it to you for $135.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 135}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $135, which is higher than my minimum but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Leaving room for counteroffers:** This allows Bob to feel like he's getting a good deal and encourages him to counteroffer rather than simply rejecting. 
* **Staying above John's offer:** This ensures that even if the negotiation stalls, I can still sell to John and make a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $125. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is close, but still below my minimum:** While $125 is closer to my minimum of $120, it's still not quite there. 
* **Potential for a better deal:** There's a chance I can get closer to my desired price if I counteroffer.
* **John's offer is a safety net:** If I can't get a better price from Bob, I can always sell to John, so there's no immediate pressure to accept."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $125 is still a little too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $127.50?  That's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit."", ""product_price"": 127.5}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  I'm proposing a price that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer. This demonstrates a willingness to compromise and can make Bob feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **Staying above minimum:** This price is still above my minimum, ensuring I'm not losing money.
* **Maintaining pressure:**  This counteroffer keeps the negotiation moving forward and increases the likelihood of a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $125 again? I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is at my minimum:** While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price.
* **Avoiding further negotiation:**  Continuing to counteroffer could lead to a stalemate or even a rejection, potentially causing me to sell to John at a lower price.
* **Securing the sale:**  Accepting Bob's offer ensures a sale and guarantees my minimum profit."
