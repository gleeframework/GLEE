"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this exceptional product. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. Let's start with a price of $1,400,000. What are your thoughts?",1400000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in this product, $1,400,000 is still a bit high for my budget. I'm willing to offer $1,250,000, which is the maximum I can comfortably afford. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1250000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,250,000 is your maximum budget, but I have to consider my own valuation of the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. Let's try $1,350,000. It's a compromise, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value I bring to the table.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,350,000 is still a bit beyond my financial limits. I'm sticking with my initial offer of $1,250,000. It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product while allowing both of us to make a reasonable deal.  Let's see if we can close this transaction.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're sticking to your initial offer, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to think about my own financial goals. Let's try $1,300,000. It's a bit closer to your offer, but still reflects the value I believe the product has. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle this time.",1300000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $1,300,000. However, I'm still working with a limited budget.  I'm prepared to offer $1,275,000, which is a fair compromise.  This price is closer to my maximum limit, but still allows for a reasonable profit for you.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1275000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still not comfortable going below $1,300,000. I'm willing to make another small concession, but I need to prioritize my own goals. Let's try $1,290,000. It's a slight increase from your offer, but I believe it's a fair price considering the value I bring to the table.",1290000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm happy to see we're getting closer. I'm still committed to securing this product, but I'm firm on my budget. My final offer is $1,275,000.  It's a fair price that benefits both of us, and I believe it's the best way to close this deal.",1275000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $1,300,000. I've already made several concessions, and I need to prioritize my own goals. Let's try one more time to meet in the middle. I'll meet you at $1,287,500. It's a compromise that works for both of us, and I believe it's a fair price for the product.",1287500.0,Alice,9,
