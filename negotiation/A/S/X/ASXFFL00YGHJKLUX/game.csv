"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a unique opportunity that I believe will be highly valuable to your business. My starting price is $1,000,000. I'm confident that we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but that price is a little high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $850,000?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and the offer, but $850,000 is unfortunately below my minimum. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $925,000. This would still allow for a significant gain for you while remaining fair to me.",925000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  While $925,000 is closer, I'm aiming for a price point closer to $800,000.  Would you consider $875,000?",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I understand you're looking for a price closer to $800,000, but I'm still a bit far from that.  However, to continue moving forward, I'm willing to drop my price to $900,000. This is a significant concession from my previous offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise.",900000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the movement you've made on the price.  To be honest, I need to be closer to $850,000 to make this work.  Would you be willing to consider $860,000?  That's a significant jump on my end, and I think it would be a fair deal for both of us.",860000.0,Bob,6,
