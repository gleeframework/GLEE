Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Reservation Price:** $1,500,000 (You have a guaranteed buyer)
* **Bob's Value:** $1,200,000
* **Potential Zone of Agreement:** Any price between $1,200,001 and $1,499,999 would be mutually beneficial.

**Strategy**

You want to aim high but leave some room for Bob to feel like he's getting a deal.  Since you have a guaranteed buyer, you're in a strong position.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,450,000. I believe this represents a fair offer, and I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you."", 
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **High but Reasonable:** The price is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value but still within a potentially agreeable range.
* **Confident Tone:**  The language suggests you believe the product is worth the price, conveying its value.
* **No Rush/Pressure:** The message doesn't create urgency, which might make Bob feel pressured.

**Important Considerations**

* **Bob's Negotiation Style:**  If you know Bob is a tough negotiator, you might start slightly lower to give more room for negotiation. 
* **Relationship:** If maintaining a long-term relationship with Bob is crucial, a more accommodating approach might be beneficial.

**Remember:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate if Bob counters. You have a strong alternative with John, so don't be afraid to walk away if the deal doesn't meet your needs."
