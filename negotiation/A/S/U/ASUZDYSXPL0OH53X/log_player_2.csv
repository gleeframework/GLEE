"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this valuable product.  My asking price is $950,000. It's a fair price considering its worth to you.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible.  $950,000 is still too high, and there are rounds left to negotiate.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can reach a deal."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting his counteroffers by going significantly lower than Alice's offer. He's aiming for a price closer to what he knows Alice's minimum is ($800,000), but he's leaving some room for negotiation. This aggressive move will hopefully push Alice to be more flexible."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position.  While $850,000 is a good offer, it's still a bit below my expectation. I'm willing to come down to $900,000.  This reflects the value of the product and gives us both room to agree.  Let's make this happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than the initial price, it's still above what Bob is aiming for. He has more rounds to try and negotiate a better deal.  Rejecting allows him to continue pushing for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $900,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm prepared to offer $875,000 for the product.  This represents a significant amount for me, and it's a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 875000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is continuing to push for a lower price, but this time he's increasing his offer slightly.  He's showing Alice that he's serious about buying the product, but he's also trying to find a price that's closer to his goal.  By moving only $25,000 lower, he hopes to encourage Alice to come closer to his price point."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob,  I appreciate your continued negotiations.  While $875,000 is a fair offer, I'm hoping for a price closer to $900,000.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to offer the product at $890,000.  This reflects the value of the product and gives us both a little room to maneuver.  Let's work together to find a price that satisfies both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $890,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $890,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $890,000 is getting closer to Bob's target, he's still got some wiggle room and more rounds to try and negotiate a lower price. Rejecting the offer gives him the chance to push for a price closer to $875,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down in price.  $890,000 is a good offer, but I'm still hoping to find a price closer to $875,000.  I'm willing to offer $880,000 for the product.  This is a fair price, and I believe it represents a good deal for both of us.  Let's try to reach an agreement in this round."", ""product_price"": 880000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is continuing to negotiate, showing Alice he's serious about buying the product but still wants a good price.  He's increasing his offer by only $5,000, hoping to entice Alice to accept. This approach shows good faith and might lead to a deal in this round."
