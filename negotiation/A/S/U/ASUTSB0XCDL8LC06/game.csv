"Thanks for the offer Alice, but $200 is a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $100 for the product. What do you think?",100.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $200 is a bit steep, but I think the product is still worth a significant amount to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $175. What do you think?",175.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $175 is still a bit high for me.  I'm really only comfortable paying $120. If you're willing to go that low, I'm ready to buy right now.",120.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $175 is still a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $120. I'm willing to compromise and offer it to you for $155. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",155.0,Alice,5,
