Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the price, but I am looking to keep my budget under $1,200,000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,100,000 for your product. I hope this is within your consideration. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

The offer from Bob is too low. I'm going to try to get a better price from him in the next round."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but it's still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can make a deal."", ""product_price"": 1250000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to counter with an offer of $1,200,000 for your product. I believe this is a fair price considering our previous discussions. I look forward to your response. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
Bob's offer is close to my minimum. It's better than dealing with John, as I'd make less money than this. I'll take this deal and be done with it!"
