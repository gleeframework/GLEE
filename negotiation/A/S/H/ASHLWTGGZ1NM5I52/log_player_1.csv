Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you first. I think it would be very valuable to you. What do you think about a price of $135?"", ""product_price"": 135}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High, Leaving Room to Negotiate:** Offering the product at $135 gives Bob the impression that you're willing to negotiate. It also sets a higher baseline than his perceived value ($120), but not so high ($150) that he'll immediately walk away. 
* **Highlighting Value to Bob:** Emphasizing the product's value to Bob specifically might make him more inclined to meet a price closer to your minimum.
* **Alternative Buyer as Leverage:** You don't explicitly mention John, but knowing you have a guaranteed sale at $150 gives you a strong position. Bob doesn't need to know you have a buyer lined up. 

This strategy aims to maximize your profit while still giving Bob a chance to purchase a product he finds valuable."
