Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides."", 
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($100) as possible without going below your minimum ($120).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering $119 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially counter-offer, while still securing a profit for you. 
* **Alternative Buyer:** You have a guaranteed sale at $120 with John, so there's no pressure to go below that price.

**Important Note:** This assumes you have no information about Bob's negotiation style or how much he might be willing to pay above his perceived value."
