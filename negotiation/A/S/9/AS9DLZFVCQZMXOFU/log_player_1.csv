Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product and I think you'd really love it! I'm offering it to you for $150.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that is higher than my minimum value ($100) but still leaves room for negotiation. This gives Bob a chance to feel like he's getting a good deal, while still giving me a good profit.  I'm also keeping the message friendly and open to negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but $150 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $120? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's still lower than my minimum acceptable price of $100.  I'm going to try to get a higher price in the next round by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! $120 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $130 for you. This is a great deal for a product of this quality."", ""product_price"": 130}
```

I'm counteroffering with a price that's closer to Bob's offer, but still higher than my minimum acceptable price. I'm also emphasizing the value of the product to try to convince Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $110? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Although Bob's offer is still lower than my initial desired price, it's now higher than my minimum value of $100. It's also likely that further negotiation will bring even lower offers from Bob, and I risk losing the sale altogether.  I'm going to accept Bob's offer and sell the product for $110."
