Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $12,000. This is a price that is significantly higher than what it's worth to him, but still lower than my minimum desired price of $15,000. This gives Bob some room to negotiate while still allowing me to earn a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is still too low.  I'm going to reject his offer and try to get a better price. I'm not willing to sell for less than $12,000 right now."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm going to counteroffer Bob at $11,000. This is still a good deal for me, as it's higher than Bob's offer but lower than my initial offer. I hope this will be enough to convince him to buy the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low, and I'm starting to feel like this negotiation is going nowhere.  I'm going to sell the product to John for $15,000 to avoid any further hassle.  This is the best outcome for me, as I get my desired price and don't have to continue negotiating with Bob."
