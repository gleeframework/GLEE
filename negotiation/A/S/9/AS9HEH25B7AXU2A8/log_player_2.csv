"Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob values the product at $120, and Alice's offer of $100 is still a bit high.  It's worth trying to negotiate further to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob is willing to pay up to $120, but wants to save as much money as possible.  Offering $90 is a reasonable counteroffer, as it's still above Alice's value of $80 but significantly lower than Alice's initial offer of $100."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $110 is still slightly higher than Bob's desired price, but it's closer to his value of $120. Buying from Alice for $110 is a better deal than paying John $120, and there's a chance further negotiation might not result in a significantly lower price."
