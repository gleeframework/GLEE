"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1200000 is a significant discount, but I'm afraid I can't go that low. Considering the product's value and rarity, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer you $1800000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. What do you think?",1800000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that $1400000 is still a bit above your budget, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll offer you $1600000, which is as low as I'm willing to go. This is a final offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. What do you think?",1600000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your previous offers, but I'm afraid $1600000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1200000, which is the maximum I'm willing to spend. Can you meet me at this price?",1200000.0,Bob,6,

"I understand that $1200000 is your maximum budget, Bob. However, I'm not willing to sell the product for that price.
