"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway. My counteroffer is $1300000. Let's see if we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I value our conversation,  $1300000 is still below my minimum acceptable price.  Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $1400000. This would still give you a significant value for the product while ensuring I can reach my target price.  What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,3,
