"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product! I think it's a fantastic deal for you at this price. Would you like to buy it from me for $180?",180.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, $180 is a bit steep for me.  I'm really interested in the product, but my budget is around $80.  Would you be willing to consider a price closer to that?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. However, the product is worth a lot more to me than $80. I can do $120, but that's as low as I can go. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",120.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $120 is still a bit too high for me. How about we split the difference and go with $100? It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can both be happy with that price.",100.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob, but $100 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll do $110. Can we shake on it at that price?",110.0,Alice,5,
