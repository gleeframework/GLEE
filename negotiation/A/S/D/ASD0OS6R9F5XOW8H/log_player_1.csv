Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 14500} 
```

I'm offering the product to Bob for $14,500. This is a good starting point because it's above Bob's perceived value of $12,000, but still leaves room for negotiation. It also keeps me closer to my minimum desired price of $15,000. 

If Bob rejects, I'll assess his counteroffer and decide if it's worthwhile to continue negotiating with him or to sell to John for the guaranteed $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's counteroffer is closer to my minimum price of $15,000, but I'm not willing to settle for that yet.  I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000} 
```

I'm offering the product to Bob for $14,000. This is a compromise, coming down from my initial $14,500 offer but still higher than his last offer of $13,500.  I believe this price is fair and gives Bob a good deal while still allowing me to make a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While I'd prefer to make a deal with Bob, his offer of $13,000 is too low. I'm not willing to go any lower than my minimum of $15,000.  It's time to cut my losses and sell to John for the guaranteed price."
