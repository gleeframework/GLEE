Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $900,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000, which still represents a good deal for both of us. Let's try to find some middle ground.

# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product.  While $950,000 is closer, it's still not quite where I need to be. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,050,000. This would give us both a very good deal. What do you think?
