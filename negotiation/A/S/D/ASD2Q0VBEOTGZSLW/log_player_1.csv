"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for both of us. I'm confident it's a mutually beneficial deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for you as well.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
 
While $900,000 is a significant amount, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. I'll counter Bob's offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $900,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000, which still represents a good deal for both of us. Let's try to find some middle ground."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  How about $950,000?  This is a fair compromise, and it would allow us both to get a good deal.  Let's work together to find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still below my minimum. I'm going to make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product.  While $950,000 is closer, it's still not quite where I need to be. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,050,000. This would give us both a very good deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  $1,050,000 is still a bit higher than I can go right now.  I'm willing to offer $1,000,000 for the product.  This is my final offer, as I'm prepared to go with John's offer if we can't reach an agreement.  Let's see if we can close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This is a tricky situation.  Bob's offer is my minimum, but I'm concerned that if I reject it, he might actually go with John.  At this point, it's better to lock in the deal and take the $1,000,000 rather than risk losing the sale altogether."
