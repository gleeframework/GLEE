"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a unique opportunity to acquire a valuable item that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,500. This is a fair price considering its value to you, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $9,500 is tempting, you know you have a backup option with John for $10,000. By rejecting Alice's offer, you can try to negotiate a lower price with her or proceed to purchase from John, saving yourself $500."
