# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I can see we're really close to a deal, and I appreciate your flexibility. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target. I can do $1,080,000, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. What do you think?

**Reasoning:**

While we could continue to negotiate, Alice has clearly stated this is her final offer. The difference between her offer ($1,080,000) and our last counteroffer ($1,060,000) is relatively small. Accepting now secures a good price and avoids the risk of Alice walking away or the negotiations stalling."
