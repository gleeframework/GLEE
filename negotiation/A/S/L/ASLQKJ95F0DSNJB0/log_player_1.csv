"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $100. I think it's a fair price considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $100, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but still lower than my minimum acceptable price. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Friendly approach:**  A friendly message sets a positive tone and encourages Bob to engage in the negotiation.
* **Focus on value:**  I highlight the product's value to encourage Bob to consider my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. I'm willing to pay a fair price, but I'm on a tight budget. Can you meet me at $80? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:** $80 is below my minimum acceptable price of $120. 
* **Potential for negotiation:**  While Bob is on a tight budget, there's still room for negotiation. I can try to meet him halfway or find a compromise.
* **Selling to John is the backup option:**  Selling to John for $120 is always an option, but I want to exhaust all possibilities with Bob first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $80 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $90. This is still a good deal for you, and it gives me a bit more room to work with.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm meeting Bob halfway, offering a price that's closer to his offer but still above my minimum.
* **Empathy:** I acknowledge his budget constraints to build rapport.
* **Focus on win-win:** I highlight the benefits for both of us, emphasizing the ""good deal"" aspect for Bob.
* **Open to further negotiation:** My message leaves room for Bob to counteroffer if he's still not satisfied."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $90 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $85. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:** $85 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $120.
* **Room for further negotiation:**  Bob is showing willingness to negotiate and has increased his offer. There's potential to get closer to my desired price.
* **Strategic play:** By rejecting his offer, I can send a counteroffer and potentially push him to agree to a price closer to $90.

I'm willing to take a small risk by continuing to negotiate, hoping to get a better price than the $85 Bob is offering. However, if the negotiation doesn't improve in the next round, I'll consider selling to John for $120."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a bit away from where I need to be.  How about $88? It's a compromise, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 88}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small counteroffer:** I'm only increasing the price by $3 from Bob's offer, showing a willingness to compromise further. 
* **Emphasis on fairness:**  I emphasize that $88 is fair for both of us, hoping to appeal to Bob's sense of reason.
* **Closing the deal:**  I add a sense of urgency by suggesting that we close the deal, hoping to persuade Bob to accept.

**Strategy:**

I'm aiming to keep the negotiation moving forward while slowly increasing the price. I'm still below my desired price of $90, but I believe this counteroffer is reasonable enough that Bob might accept. If he rejects, I'll assess the situation and consider selling to John if further negotiation seems unlikely to get me closer to my goal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close, but $88 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $84, but that's my final offer. Can you meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $84. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $84
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Below Minimum:** $84 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $120. While it's getting closer to my desired price, it's still not enough.
* **Potential for Counteroffer:** Bob has stated this is his ""final offer,"" but there's always a chance he might budge a bit if I make a compelling counteroffer.
* **Remaining Rounds:**  I have four rounds left, which is enough time to continue negotiating.

I'm going to risk it by rejecting Bob's offer and making a counteroffer. I'll aim for a price closer to $90, but I'll be ready to accept his offer or sell to John if the negotiation stalls."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're firm on your offer, but $84 is still a little too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you in the middle and offer $86. This is a fair compromise and lets us both walk away happy.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 86} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering $86, which is the midpoint between Bob's offer of $84 and my previous offer of $88. This demonstrates my willingness to compromise and reach an agreement.
* **Positive Framing:** I emphasize the ""fair compromise"" and the potential for ""both walking away happy."" This encourages Bob to see the benefit of accepting.
* **Urgency:** By suggesting we reach a decision, I aim to create a sense of urgency and encourage Bob to accept the offer before he has a chance to change his mind.

**Strategy:**

I'm still aiming to achieve a price closer to $90, but I acknowledge that Bob is firm on his offer. I hope that by offering a fair compromise, I can convince him to accept and close the deal before I have to consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $86 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $82, but that's my final offer. Can you meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $82. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $82
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is Running Out:** We are in round 8, and with only 2 rounds left, the chance of getting a better price from Bob is becoming increasingly slim.
* **Below Minimum:** $82 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $120.  
* **John's Offer:**  Selling to John for $120 guarantees me my minimum acceptable price. 

With time running out and Bob's final offer still being too low, it's best to secure the guaranteed $120 from John and avoid further negotiation with Bob."
