"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $100. I think it's a fair price considering its value. What do you think?",100.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. I'm willing to pay a fair price, but I'm on a tight budget. Can you meet me at $80?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $80 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $90. This is still a good deal for you, and it gives me a bit more room to work with.  What do you think?",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $90 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $85. Can you consider that?",85.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a bit away from where I need to be.  How about $88? It's a compromise, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. Let's close this deal.",88.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close, but $88 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $84, but that's my final offer. Can you meet me there?",84.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're firm on your offer, but $84 is still a little too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you in the middle and offer $86. This is a fair compromise and lets us both walk away happy.  What do you say?",86.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $86 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $82, but that's my final offer. Can you meet me there?",82.0,Bob,8,
