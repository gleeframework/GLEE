"Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product, and I think you'd find it valuable. I'm asking for $160 to start. What do you think?",160.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $160 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $80.  Let me know what you think.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, Bob, but $80 is quite a bit lower than I'd be comfortable with. How about we meet in the middle at $140?",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you trying to find a compromise, Alice.  However, $140 is still a bit out of my price range. Would you consider $90? That's a significant jump from my last offer.",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I'm aiming for a higher price, I'm willing to come down to $120, my absolute lowest.  This is a deal you won't find elsewhere.",120.0,Alice,5,
