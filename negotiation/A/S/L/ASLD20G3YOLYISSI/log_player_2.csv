"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you trying to find a compromise, Alice.  However, $140 is still a bit out of my price range. Would you consider $90? That's a significant jump from my last offer."",

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I'm aiming for a higher price, I'm willing to come down to $120, my absolute lowest.  This is a deal you won't find elsewhere. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to her lowest price of $120.  This is still higher than your maximum budget of $100 and what John is offering. There's no point in continuing the negotiation. You're better off taking the guaranteed deal from John."
