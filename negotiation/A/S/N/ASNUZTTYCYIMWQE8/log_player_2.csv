"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $120.  This is a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly less than what it's worth to you. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

Alice's offer is tempting, but there's a chance we can get a better price. By rejecting her initial offer, we might be able to negotiate a lower price, closer to her $80 value. If Alice doesn't budge, we can always buy from John for $150 as a backup."
