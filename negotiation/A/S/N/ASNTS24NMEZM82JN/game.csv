"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting our conversation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $900,000. This is a great starting point, and I'm open to negotiating to find a mutually beneficial price.",900000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I see the potential in this product, $900,000 is a bit too high for me at this point.  I'm willing to pay $750,000.  I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows for a mutually beneficial outcome.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product has a lot of value to offer. After considering your proposal, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $850,000. I think this is a fair price that reflects the product's value and allows us to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I acknowledge the value of this product, $850,000 is still a bit high for my budget. I'm prepared to pay $800,000 for it. This price is closer to my initial assessment of its worth, and I believe it represents a fair compromise that benefits both of us.",800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm not willing to go all the way down to $800,000 just yet. I'm willing to make another concession and offer you $825,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",825000.0,Alice,5,
