"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to acquire this exceptional product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a one-time offer of $10,000. This is a fair price, considering the value you place on it at $12,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $10,000 is less than your maximum of $12,000, you know you have another option with John.  There's a chance you could get a better price by rejecting Alice's offer and seeing if she'll come down further."
