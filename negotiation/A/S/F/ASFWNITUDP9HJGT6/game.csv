"I understand you're interested in the product, and I appreciate your offer of $1000000. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to compromise and offer it to you for $1400000. This is a significant discount from the initial price, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value.",1400000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to meet you at $1200000, which is the midpoint of our previous offers. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value.",1200000.0,Bob,4,

"I see you're willing to meet me at $1200000, Bob. I appreciate your flexibility. However, I'm not ready to give up on getting a better price for the product. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $1300000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value.",1300000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to meet you at $1200000, but I'd like to propose a compromise. How about we meet at $1250000? I think this is a fair price considering the product's value.",1250000.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm willing to consider your compromise. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $1250000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm offering the product to you for $1280000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value.",1280000.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm really struggling to justify the price at $1290000. I'm willing to meet you at $1275000, but I think that's as high as I can go. If we can't meet at this price, I'm afraid I'll have to consider buying the product from John for $1000000.",1275000.0,Bob,10,
