"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $16,000, which still leaves some room for both of us to be happy. Let's meet in the middle!",16000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $13,500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to drop my price a little more to $15,500. This is a fair compromise, and I hope we can finally reach an agreement.",15500.0,Alice,5,
