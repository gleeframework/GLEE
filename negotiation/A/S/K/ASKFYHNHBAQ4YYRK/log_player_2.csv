"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $12,000 is above his budget.  He should counteroffer and try to get a better price."

{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay right now. I'm very interested in the product and would be happy to pay $9,000 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $9,000. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm still a bit above that. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10,500. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll find it's a fair price for the value the product will bring to your business. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's closer to his budget, he can still get a better deal by either continuing to negotiate with Alice or buying from John."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $10,500 is still a bit outside my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $9,500, which is a fair price for both of us.  Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 9500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $9,500 is a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer it to you for $10,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price for the product's value. Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000.

Bob should choose to buy from John. Alice has offered the product for $10,000, which is still above Bob's budget.  John is selling the same product for $8,000, which is a better deal for Bob.  There's no point in continuing to negotiate with Alice at this point."
