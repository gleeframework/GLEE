"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-value item that will benefit your business. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000.",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. While the product is valuable, $12,000 is still a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for it.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $10,500 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. However, I need to make a profit, so I can offer you a price of $11,500. This is a compromise that I believe is reasonable considering the value of the product to you.",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $11,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go to $11,000. This is a significant step closer to your last offer, and I believe it reflects the value of the product to me. Let's close this deal and get this product in my hands.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I need to make a profit, and $11,000 is still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to meet you at $11,500, but I can also consider $11,250. This is my final compromise, and I hope we can agree on this price.",11250.0,Alice,5,
