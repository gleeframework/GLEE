Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $10,000 is quite a bit lower than what I had in mind. Could you consider something closer to $18,000?  I'm confident this product will exceed your expectations and provide significant value.

Round 5

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand this is a significant purchase for you, and I want to be fair.  I've reconsidered my position and am willing to accept $14,000, but this is absolutely my bottom line.  It's a fantastic deal for a product you won't regret owning. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** 

While Alice has come down in price, it's unlikely she'll go much lower than $14,000.  At this point, accepting her offer would still be a $6,000 difference from John's offer. It's not worth the risk of continuing the negotiation with Alice.  Buying from John guarantees the best price and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation."
