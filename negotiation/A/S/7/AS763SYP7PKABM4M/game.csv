"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its unique value and features, I'm proposing a starting price of $22,000. What do you think?",22000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  That price is a bit too high for me, though. I'm looking to spend closer to $10,000. Would that work for you?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $10,000 is quite a bit lower than what I had in mind. Could you consider something closer to $18,000?  I'm confident this product will exceed your expectations and provide significant value.",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find common ground.  While I believe in the product's value, $18,000 is still beyond my reach.  Would you be willing to consider $12,000?",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your continued interest. I'm seeing some movement here, which is good!  How about we meet in the middle at $15,000? This would be my final offer.",15000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $15,000 is still a little steep for me, though.  Given it's your final offer, would you consider $13,000? That's the absolute highest I can go.",13000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand this is a significant purchase for you, and I want to be fair.  I've reconsidered my position and am willing to accept $14,000, but this is absolutely my bottom line.  It's a fantastic deal for a product you won't regret owning.",14000.0,Alice,7,
