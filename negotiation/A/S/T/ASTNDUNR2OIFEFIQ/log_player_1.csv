"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

This is my initial offer to Bob. I'm starting high, at $1,500,000, to see if there's room for negotiation. I believe this product is worth more than $1,000,000 to me, and I'm hoping to get as close to that value as possible. 

If Bob rejects, I'll assess his counteroffer and adjust my strategy accordingly.  However, I'm keeping the option to sell to John at $1,000,000 in mind as a safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my initial offer, and also lower than my minimum value for the product. While I'm open to negotiation, $800,000 is not acceptable at this point. 

I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round.  I'll likely lower my price a bit, but aim to stay above $1,000,000 to ensure I get a fair deal.  I'm also keeping John's offer as a backup option in case negotiations with Bob fall apart."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

I'm lowering my price to $1,200,000. This is still above my minimum value of $1,000,000, but it shows Bob that I'm willing to be flexible. I'm hoping this counteroffer will encourage Bob to come closer to my desired price.  

If he rejects again, I will need to seriously consider John's offer.  Each round brings us closer to the end of the negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum value of $1,000,000. While it's getting closer, I believe there's still room for negotiation. I'm going to reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round.  I'm running out of time, but I'm not willing to settle for a price that undervalues my product. I'll try to bridge the gap and see if we can reach an agreement.  However, John's offer is always in the back of my mind as a safety net."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

This is my final attempt to get a better price from Bob. I'm lowering my offer to $1,100,000, which is still above my minimum value.  I'm hoping this demonstrates my commitment to making a deal while also acknowledging that time is running out. 

If Bob rejects this offer, I'll have no choice but to accept John's offer to avoid losing any further value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

With only four rounds left, time is running out and Bob's offer is still below my minimum value. I need to secure a sale to avoid losing any more potential profit.  While $1,000,000 is not ideal, it's the best I can do under these circumstances.  

I'll accept John's offer and move on.  I've learned that it's important to set a firm minimum value for my product and to be willing to walk away from deals that undervalue it."
