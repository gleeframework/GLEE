{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,150,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's significantly higher than my minimum:**  This ensures I'm not leaving too much money on the table. 
* **It's lower than Bob's perceived value:** This gives Bob room to feel like he's getting a good deal and encourages him to negotiate. 
* **It's a clear and concise offer:**  This helps keep the negotiation focused.

I'm open to counteroffers from Bob, but I'll always have John as a backup buyer if the negotiation doesn't go well."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less.  I'm willing to offer $1,050,000 for the product. This is still a fair price considering its value to you and my budget. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Bob's offer is too low, and I'm not willing to settle for that price. I'm confident I can get a better deal from him or John. I'm going to counter-offer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,050,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll accept $1,100,000 for the product.  This price is still a good deal for you, considering its value. Let's see if we can finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
