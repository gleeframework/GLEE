"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product! I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $18000. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in this product, but I'm only willing to go up to $10000. Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $10000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. I can do $14000, which is a significant discount from my original price. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $14000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference. I'll offer you $12000.  Let's see if we can make a deal.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're trying to split the difference, but I'm still not comfortable with $12000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $14000 and $12000, which would be $13000. I think this is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $13000 is still a bit more than I'm aiming for. Let's try $12500. I'm confident this is a fair price that benefits both of us.",12500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're trying to get closer to your target price, but I'm still not comfortable with $12500. I'm willing to give you a slight concession and meet you at $13200. I think this is a fair price considering the value of the product and the effort I've put into the negotiation. What do you think?",13200.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but I'm still not quite there. Let's try $12800. I'm getting closer to my limit and  I believe this is a good compromise for both of us.",12800.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're getting close to your limit, but I'm still not comfortable with $12800. I'm willing to make one more concession and meet you at $13400. I think this is a fair price considering the value of the product and the effort I've put into the negotiation. What do you think?",13400.0,Alice,9,
