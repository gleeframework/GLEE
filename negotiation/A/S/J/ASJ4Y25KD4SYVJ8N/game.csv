"Hi Bob, thank you for your revised offer of $8750. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still not comfortable going below $9000.

"Hello Alice, thank you for your latest offer of $8900. I've given it careful consideration, and while I appreciate your effort to meet me halfway, I must respectfully decline. I've found another seller, John, who is willing to sell the product to me for $12000. However, I would like to see if there's any possibility of closing the deal with you at a price closer to my maximum budget of $8500. Could you possibly reconsider your offer?",8500.0,Bob,6,
