"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to make sure it's within my budget. Can you meet me halfway?",9500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $9,500 is a bit too low for me. How about $10,500? This is still a great price considering the value of the product to you. Let's try to close this deal.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again. How about $10,000? I'm willing to pay the full value of the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider this offer?",10000.0,Bob,4,
