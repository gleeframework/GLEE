"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start the negotiation, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a great starting point, and I'm open to further discussion to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Alice's initial offer of $1,200,000 is still significantly higher than Bob's maximum budget of $800,000. It's best to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,200,000 is still above my budget. To demonstrate my serious interest in this product, I'm willing to offer you $900,000. This is a significant step towards a deal, and I'm hopeful we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to sell the product for $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the market demand. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $1,050,000 is still above Bob's budget of $800,000. While it's a lower price than the initial offer, it's still not within Bob's desired range.  It's worth continuing negotiations to see if a lower price can be achieved."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me.  To show my commitment to this deal, I'm offering you $950,000. This represents a significant step closer to our target price, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go down to $950,000. I'm willing to make another concession and offer you the product for $1,025,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value and the time and effort we've invested in it. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice has shown a willingness to compromise, her latest offer of $1,025,000 is still above Bob's budget. It's important to continue negotiating, especially since there are still a few rounds left to explore a lower price.  Rejecting this offer keeps the possibility open for a more favorable price in the future rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your continued effort to negotiate. While your offer is getting closer, $1,025,000 is still not within my budget.  I'm willing to offer you $975,000.  This is a significant step towards reaching a mutually beneficial agreement.  Let's work together to bridge this small gap and finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 975000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go down to $975,000. I'm willing to make another small concession and offer you the product for $1,015,000. This is the best price I can offer, considering the product's value and our previous discussions. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,015,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,015,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $1,015,000 is still above Bob's budget of $800,000. While Alice has shown a willingness to compromise, it's unlikely she will drop the price significantly enough in the remaining rounds for Bob to comfortably buy the product. With only a few rounds left, it's more beneficial for Bob to purchase the product from John at his pre-determined price of $800,000. This ensures that Bob gets the product within his budget and avoids the risk of further negotiations potentially failing."
