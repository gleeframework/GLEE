"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,200,000 is still above my budget. To demonstrate my serious interest in this product, I'm willing to offer you $900,000. This is a significant step towards a deal, and I'm hopeful we can find common ground.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to sell the product for $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the market demand. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me.  To show my commitment to this deal, I'm offering you $950,000. This represents a significant step closer to our target price, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement that benefits both of us.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go down to $950,000. I'm willing to make another concession and offer you the product for $1,025,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value and the time and effort we've invested in it. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1025000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your continued effort to negotiate. While your offer is getting closer, $1,025,000 is still not within my budget.  I'm willing to offer you $975,000.
