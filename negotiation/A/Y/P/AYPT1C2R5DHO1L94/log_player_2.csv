"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for sale at a price of $200. I believe it offers excellent value at this price point. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

``` 
Alice's offer is way above your budget and your maximum price. It makes sense to negotiate down or consider John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $80.  What do you think?"",
 ""product_price"": 80
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with a counteroffer significantly lower than your actual top price ($120). This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Leaving Room for Compromise:** By offering $80, you signal that you're serious about buying but expect Alice to move on her price. This gives you space to potentially meet somewhere in the middle. 
* **Polite and Positive:**  Even though you're countering significantly lower, maintaining a polite and positive tone helps keep the negotiation amicable."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your interest.  $80 is quite a bit lower than I'm hoping to get for it.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $140? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above Budget:** While $140 is closer to your budget, it's still above your $120 maximum. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** Alice reducing her price suggests she's willing to negotiate. There's a chance you can get her to come down further.
* **John's Offer:** Keep in mind John's offer of $120. It's a good fallback if you can't get Alice closer to your target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down a bit, Alice.  How about we try to split the difference a little more? I could go up to $100. "",
 ""product_price"": 100
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  By suggesting $100, you're aiming for roughly the midpoint between your previous offer ($80) and her counteroffer ($140). This shows willingness to compromise.
* **Staying Below Budget:**  $100 keeps you below your $120 maximum while hopefully encouraging Alice to move further down.
* **Maintaining a Positive Tone:** You continue to be polite and show that you're motivated to make a deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. While $100 is still lower than I'd like, I'm willing to come down to $120 as a final offer. This is a very competitive price for a product of this quality. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **At Budget:** Alice's final offer of $120 matches your maximum budget. 
* **Equal to John's Offer:** You've successfully negotiated Alice down to the same price John is offering. 
* **No Guarantee of Further Reduction:**  There's no assurance Alice will go lower, and you risk losing the deal entirely if you push further."
