"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product, which I believe would greatly benefit you based on your needs and preferences. Given its value to you, I propose a price of $100 for this item. This price reflects the quality and functionality of the product while allowing us to maintain a fair profit margin. I trust that you'll find it to be a worthwhile investment. Please let me know if you have any questions or if you're ready to proceed with the purchase. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $100 is less than your maximum budget of $120. 
* However, you know you can get the product for $120 from John if you reject Alice's offer. 
* By rejecting Alice's offer, you might encourage her to propose a lower price, getting you a better deal.  

It's a negotiation tactic to try and secure a lower price, even if you are ultimately willing to pay the $120."
