Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it's worth a significant amount, but I'm willing to let it go for $10,000. This is a take-it-or-leave-it offer."", 
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing the minimum:** I know I have a guaranteed $8,000 from John, so I shouldn't offer the product to Bob for less.
* **Aiming high:** Since the product is worth $8,000 to Bob, there's a chance he might be willing to pay a premium.  A significantly higher offer like $10,000 tests his willingness to pay extra for potentially faster access or to avoid missing out.
* **One-time offer:** By making it clear this is my only offer, I create a sense of urgency and avoid getting stuck in back-and-forth negotiations.

This strategy aims to maximize profit while still keeping the offer within a potentially acceptable range for Bob."
