"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm really interested in the product but $115 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $105.  What do you think?",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $105 is a little too low for me.  How about we split the difference and I let it go for $110?  It's a great product that's worth it, and it's still a good deal for you.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $110 is still a little higher than I'd like to go. How about we meet in the middle at $107.50? It's a fair price for both of us.",107.5,Bob,4,
