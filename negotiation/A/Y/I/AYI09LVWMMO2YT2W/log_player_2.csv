{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's not worth it to buy the product from Alice at $12,000.  I'll try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

I'm starting with a low offer, knowing it's likely Alice won't accept it. However, this sets the negotiation in my favor and forces Alice to come down from her initial price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

Alice is still too high. I'll keep negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}

I'm increasing my offer slightly, showing I'm willing to compromise but still pushing for a good price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

Alice's offer is still too high.  It's better to buy the product from John at the guaranteed $10,000 price.  Further negotiation with Alice may not result in a lower price, and I don't want to risk running out of rounds."
