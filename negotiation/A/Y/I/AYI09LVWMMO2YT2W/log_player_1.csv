"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm going to start by offering the product at my minimum price of $12,000.  I know it's a bit more than the product is worth to Bob, but I'm hoping he'll be willing to negotiate. If he rejects, I'll have to decide whether to lower the price or sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is way too low. I won't accept it. I will counteroffer in the next round, aiming for a price closer to my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm going to counter with $11,000. This is still above Bob's initial offer, but it's a significant reduction from my starting price. I'm hoping this shows that I'm willing to negotiate and that we can find a price that works for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low. I'm not willing to settle for that. I'll make another counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

I'm going to counter with $10,500.  This is closer to Bob's offer, but still above his last one. I'm hoping we can find common ground soon before I have to sell to John."
