"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but the product is worth significantly more than that to both of us. How about we meet in the middle at $9,000?",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, Alice. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to pay $9,000. How about we try $8,200? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget.",8200.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I see you're trying to stay within your budget, this product truly is valuable, and $8,200 is below what I can accept.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $8,800, but that's my final offer.",8800.0,Alice,5,
