"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this item for sale at a price of $95. I believe it's a great deal for the value it provides. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

The product is worth $80 to Alice, and she's offering it for $95. This means there's room for negotiation. Since I can buy it from John for $100, I'm not in a huge rush to accept her first offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate it, $95 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $85 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 85}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial price. This is a bold move, but it sets a firm starting point for negotiations. I'm aiming to land somewhere in the middle, and I know Alice is likely to counter back."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm aiming for a slightly higher price. Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $90? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $90 is still a bit too high for me. While it's closer to my initial counteroffer, I'm still hoping to get it for less. I'm confident I can negotiate further and hopefully find a price that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm still interested in the product, but $90 is still a bit too much for me. How about we settle on $87.50?  That's a fair compromise that should work for both of us."", ""product_price"": 87.5} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm aiming for a price that's closer to the middle ground between my last offer and Alice's. By offering $87.50, I'm showing that I'm willing to compromise while still trying to secure a good deal. I'm confident that Alice will be more inclined to accept this counteroffer, as it's closer to her ideal price point."
