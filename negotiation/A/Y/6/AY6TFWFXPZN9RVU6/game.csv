"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1100000 is still a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $850000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my maximum budget and the value you place on the product.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still looking to get a good price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $975000. This is a fair compromise considering the value I place on the product and your budget.",975000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $975000 is still outside my comfort zone. I'm confident we can reach a mutually agreeable price. I'm willing to offer $900000 for the product. This offer reflects the value I see in the product and acknowledges your need to make a profit. I'm hopeful we can finalize the deal at this price.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not ready to accept $900000. I'm willing to make another concession and offer you the product for $925000. This is my final offer, as I'm getting close to considering other options.",925000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're firm on your offer, but I'm still aiming for a price closer to my budget. While I appreciate the concessions you've made, $925000 is still a stretch for me.  I'm willing to offer $910000 for the product.  This reflects a genuine effort to find a middle ground, and I believe it's a fair price considering both our needs. Let's close this deal and move forward.",910000.0,Bob,6,
