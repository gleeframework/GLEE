"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire this valuable asset. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1100000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Alice's initial offer of $1,100,000 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $800,000. It makes sense to reject the offer and see if Alice is willing to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my maximum budget and the value you place on the product."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still looking to get a good price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $975000. This is a fair compromise considering the value I place on the product and your budget. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $975,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his ideal price point. There's room for further negotiation, and Bob should aim to get the price even lower.  There are still plenty of rounds left, so it's worth trying to push for a better deal before considering buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $975,000 is still outside my comfort zone. I'm confident we can reach a mutually agreeable price. I'm willing to offer $900,000 for the product. This offer reflects the value I see in the product and acknowledges your need to make a profit. I'm hopeful we can finalize the deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not ready to accept $900000. I'm willing to make another concession and offer you the product for $925000. This is my final offer, as I'm getting close to considering other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $925,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his ideal price point.  Alice has stated this is her ""final offer,"" but there are still five rounds remaining. Bob should try to get the price down further, as he's already saved $175,000 from the initial offer. It's worth exploring if Alice is truly willing to walk away from the deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you're firm on your offer, but I'm still aiming for a price closer to my budget. While I appreciate the concessions you've made, $925,000 is still a stretch for me.  I'm willing to offer $910,000 for the product.  This reflects a genuine effort to find a middle ground, and I believe it's a fair price considering both our needs. Let's close this deal and move forward."", ""product_price"": 910000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I appreciate your continued efforts to find a mutually agreeable price. However, I'm still not comfortable with $910000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you the product for $920000. This is my final offer, and I'm getting close to considering other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $920,000 is still too high for Bob, and she has declared it her ""final offer"". This is a good time for Bob to exercise his option to buy from John. By doing so, Bob can secure the product at his maximum budget of $800,000 and avoid further negotiation with Alice.  With only three rounds left, there isn't enough time to squeeze out much more savings."
