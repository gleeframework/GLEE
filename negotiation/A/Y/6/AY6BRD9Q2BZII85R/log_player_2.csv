```"

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $10,000 is significantly below its true value and what I'm willing to accept.  How about we meet in the middle at $18,000? This reflects my willingness to negotiate while ensuring a fair deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still higher than my budget.  I'm willing to continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $18,000 is still outside my budget. I can offer $12,000, which represents a significant increase from my previous offer. Let's find a compromise that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your efforts to reach a compromise.  While I'm motivated to sell, I need to be mindful of the product's value. How about we settle at $16,000? This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's final offer of $16,000 is still above my budget.  It's getting close, but the risk of further negotiation is high and I'm unsure if I can get a lower price. It's more reliable to buy from John at $10,000, ensuring I get the product within my budget."
