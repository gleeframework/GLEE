``` 

This offer starts with a price that is significantly higher than what Bob is willing to pay, but still leaves room for negotiation. This gives Bob a reason to counteroffer, which will then allow you to gauge his true interest and potentially move closer to your desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I'm looking to save as much as possible. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $9,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than what the product is worth to me.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get him to move closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite there yet. I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This is still a great price for the product, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know if you're interested in this offer."", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $9,000. Can you meet me in the middle at $9,750? I think this is a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,750 is closer to my desired price, it's still significantly lower than what the product is worth to me. I'm going to try and push for a slightly higher price. I believe I can get a better deal by continuing the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. How about $10,000? That's a fair price for both of us, and it's still a great value for the product. Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close, but I still think $9,000 is a more reasonable price for the product. Can you meet me at $9,500? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob has made it clear that he is not willing to go above $9,500. While this is better than his initial offer, it's still significantly lower than what the product is worth to me. I'm not willing to settle for such a low price, and I'm confident that I can get a much better deal with John.  Therefore, I will sell the product to John for $15,000."
