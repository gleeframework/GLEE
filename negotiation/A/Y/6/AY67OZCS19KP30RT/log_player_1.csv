Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, $2,000,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $1,200,000 for it. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

**Reasoning:**

Bob is consistently inching upwards, but very slowly. At this pace, it's unlikely he'll reach a price that's significantly better than John's offer within the remaining rounds. Selling to John guarantees the $1,500,000 and avoids the risk of Bob stalling or not reaching an acceptable price."
