"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $18000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our initial offer and your counteroffer. I'm proposing a price of $19500. This is a fair compromise, considering the value the product can bring to you.",19500.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your budget constraints, Bob. I'm willing to make another compromise. I'll reduce the price by another $250, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair value for the product. I'm proposing a price of $19250. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, considering the product's value and my costs.",19250.0,Alice,5,
