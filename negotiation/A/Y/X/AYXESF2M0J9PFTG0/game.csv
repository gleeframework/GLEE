"I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we might not reach an agreement, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $132. This is as low as I'm willing to go. Is this a price you'd be willing to accept?",132.0,Alice,7,

,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go any lower than $132, Bob. I think $128 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $130. This is my final offer. Is this a price you'd be willing to accept?",130.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you at $129, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. If you can't meet me at that price, I'm afraid I'll have to consider buying it from John for $100.",129.0,Bob,10,
