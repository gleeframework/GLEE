I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum, but still below what I'd get from John. This gives me some room to negotiate while still ensuring a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $120 is more than what Bob thinks the product is worth, it's below my minimum acceptable price of $150. I'll reject his offer and try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm lowering my price a bit from my initial offer to show flexibility, but still staying above my minimum.  This is a reasonable compromise and hopefully will lead to a successful deal."

Bob's offer is getting lower and lower, and I'm not comfortable dropping my price any further. I've made a reasonable attempt to negotiate, but it's clear we can't agree. I'll take the guaranteed $150 from John."
