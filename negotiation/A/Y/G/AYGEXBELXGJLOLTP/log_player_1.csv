"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I will reject Bob's offer. While $90 is better than nothing, it is still below my minimum acceptable price of $120. I will attempt to negotiate a better price with Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
``` 
I'm offering a lower price than my initial asking price, but still above my minimum acceptable price.  This shows I'm willing to compromise, but also trying to get a price closer to what the product is worth to me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $95 is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'm willing to negotiate further to try and reach a more favorable agreement.  I'm not yet ready to sell to John, as I'm still hopeful I can get closer to my target price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

I'm lowering my price again, but still staying above my minimum acceptable price. This shows I'm flexible and willing to negotiate, but I'm also making it clear that I'm not willing to go any lower. I believe this offer is fair and hopefully will be acceptable to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $100 is the highest he's offered so far, and it aligns with what the product is worth to him.  While it's still lower than my initial asking price, it's a reasonable compromise and allows me to avoid the risk of losing the sale to John."
