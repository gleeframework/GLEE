"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $85. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $85 is a good offer, I'm aiming for a bit higher. I'm willing to come down to $95.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",95.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down to $95. I'm still a bit hesitant, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $87.50?",87.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $87.50 is just too low for me.  I'm happy to continue working with you, but I need to be closer to my minimum price. How about $92.50?  It's a fair compromise and gives us both a good deal.",92.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand that $92.50 is a compromise, but I'm still trying to stay within my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $90? I'm willing to pay a bit more, but I really need to stay under $90.",90.0,Bob,6,
