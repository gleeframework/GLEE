"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,150,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little more, but how about $1,200,000?  That's still a great price for you, and it's the minimum I can accept. Let's make this happen!",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so how about $1,175,000? That's the best I can do, and I hope you can work with me.",1175000.0,Bob,4,
