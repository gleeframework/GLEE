"Alice, $18000 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in this product, but I'm only willing to pay $12000.  Let me know if you're open to that price.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still willing to make a deal. Considering the value you've placed on the product, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll sell it to you for $16000. This is a compromise that I think is fair for both of us. Let me know if you're interested.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate you coming down to $16000, but I'm still not quite there. How about $14000?  That's a good middle ground for us, and I'm confident we can make this deal work.",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to find a middle ground, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $14000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll sell it to you for $15500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price for both of us. Let me know if you're interested.",15500.0,Alice,5,
