"I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $110 for it. Can you consider my offer?",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $110 is still a bit low for me. How about we meet in the middle?  I'm willing to come down to $125. Let's make this deal happen!",125.0,Alice,3,

,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  $115 is still a bit below what I need. How about we split the difference and I come down to $120? That's a fair price for both of us, and we can finalize this deal.",120.0,Alice,5,

"I'm getting close, but I'm still not comfortable with $120. I'm willing to pay $115 again, and I think that's a fair price for both of us. Can you reconsider?",115.0,Bob,6,
