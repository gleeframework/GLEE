"I understand that $175 is a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $185.",185.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $185 is still a bit too high for me. How about $180? That's a fair price for both of us.",180.0,Bob,4,

"I'm getting close to my minimum price, Bob. I'm willing to go a bit lower, but I need to make a profit. How about we meet at $182?",182.0,Alice,5,
