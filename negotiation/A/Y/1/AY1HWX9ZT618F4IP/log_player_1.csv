Send your offer to Bob.","```json

}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. However,  $2,200,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to offer $1,100,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective, but $1,100,000 is significantly below its true value.  I could consider a price of $1,900,000.  This is a significant reduction on my part, and reflects my willingness to find a fair deal."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  While $1,900,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit high for me.  How about $1,300,000?  That feels like a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While Bob is coming closer to a reasonable offer, we are still significantly above John's guaranteed offer. It's worth continuing the negotiation to see if we can push Bob a little higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,300,000 is still quite a bit lower than I'd like, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,600,000?  This feels like a fair compromise that recognizes the true value of the product."",
""product_price"": 1600000

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer. I appreciate the movement you've shown. How about $1,450,000?  I think that's a really fair offer and shows I'm serious about buying. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob's offer is now very close to John's guaranteed price. While we might be able to squeeze a bit more out of Bob, it's getting riskier. Accepting this offer secures a strong price and avoids the possibility of Bob walking away later in the negotiation."
