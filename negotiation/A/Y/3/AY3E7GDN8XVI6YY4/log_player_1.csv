{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal, and I know you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a good balance between maximizing profit and ensuring Bob has a chance to buy. 

* **Why $10,000?**  This price is more than Bob's perceived value of $8,000, but significantly less than your minimum desired value of $15,000. It's a good compromise that might entice Bob to buy.

* **Why the message?**  The message is friendly and encouraging. It emphasizes the value of the product and avoids making Bob feel pressured."
