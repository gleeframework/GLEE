Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1150000}
```

This offer starts the negotiation at a price that is significantly higher than John's offer, giving me room to negotiate. It also leaves room for Bob to make a counteroffer without feeling like he's getting a bad deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is lower than my minimum desired value but it's not too far off.  It's a good starting point for further negotiation. I'm willing to try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

I'm raising the price slightly from Bob's offer, but still leaving room for further negotiation. I believe this price is fair given the value of the product to both of us."
