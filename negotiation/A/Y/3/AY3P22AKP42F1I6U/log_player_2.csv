"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which has been valued at $150 by you. I am proposing to sell it to you at a special introductory price of $140. This is a great opportunity to own this valuable item at a discounted rate. Please let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $140 is tempting, you know you can get the product for $150 from John.  There's a chance Alice might be willing to lower her price further in a subsequent negotiation."
