"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 200}
```

I'm starting with a price of $200, which is above what the product is worth to Bob.  This gives me some room to negotiate if Bob counters.  I'm confident I can get a higher price than $150, but I'm also willing to stop the negotiation and sell to John for $150 if it looks like I won't get a better offer from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low. While I'm willing to negotiate, $120 is significantly less than what I'm hoping to get. I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my starting point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 180}
```

I'm countering with $180.  This is still higher than what Bob is willing to pay, but it's a significant decrease from my initial offer, showing that I'm willing to negotiate. This should hopefully entice Bob to counter with a higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While $140 is still below my desired price, it's getting closer to what I'm willing to accept.  With only 6 rounds left, it's a risk to keep rejecting offers.  It's likely that Bob won't go higher, and I'm confident I can sell to John for $150 if this deal falls through.  Accepting $140 is the best option to guarantee a sale at this point."
