"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **You have no information about the product's value to Alice.** There's a chance she's willing to sell for less than $1,000,000. 
* **Rejecting the offer gives you leverage.** You can start a negotiation process and potentially get a better price. 
* **Buying from John right now is pointless.**  You gain nothing by buying from John at the same price Alice is offering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but reasonable:**  Starting with a significant discount shows your intent to negotiate seriously.
* **Leaves room for compromise:**  You can still adjust this price based on Alice's response. 
* **Avoids immediate ""John"" purchase:** You're still trying to get a better deal than $1,000,000."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is willing to compromise:**  Her counteroffer shows she's willing to move from $1,000,000.
* **Still room for negotiation:** You can likely get the price down further.
* **""John"" is still a backup:**  If negotiations fail, you can still secure the product from John for $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** This counteroffer splits the difference between your previous offer and Alice's current offer. 
* **Shows good faith:** It demonstrates that you're willing to compromise and find a middle ground. 
* **Maintain leverage:**  It doesn't fully concede to Alice's price, leaving room for potential further negotiation."
