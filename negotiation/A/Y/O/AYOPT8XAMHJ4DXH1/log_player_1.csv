"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1000000} 

I'm starting high, aiming for a significant profit. If Bob rejects, I'll be prepared to negotiate down, but I want to see if he's truly interested and what his perceived value is."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $750,000 is a significant sum, it's still below my minimum acceptable value. I'm going to counteroffer and see if I can push Bob closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm going to lower my price slightly, but I still believe the product is worth more. I'm hoping Bob will see the value and be willing to come up a bit more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob has now offered my minimum acceptable price. While I'd prefer to get more, the risk of further negotiation failing and being forced to sell to John at the same price is too high.  Accepting Bob's offer ensures I get my minimum desired value."
