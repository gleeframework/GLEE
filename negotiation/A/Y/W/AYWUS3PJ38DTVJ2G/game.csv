"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $145 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $80 for it.",80.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob.  I understand your perspective, but the value of this product is significantly higher than that.  How about we meet in the middle at $115?",115.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  While $115 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit above my budget. Could you do $95?  That would work much better for me.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm trying to be flexible, but I need to be fair to myself as well. $105 is my final offer - I believe that reflects a fair compromise for both of us.",105.0,Alice,5,
