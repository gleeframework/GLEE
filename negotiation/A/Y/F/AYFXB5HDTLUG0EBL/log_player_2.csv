"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. It's a great deal for a product worth $1,500,000 to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your maximum budget. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value of your product, $1,750,000 is a bit outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming to get a lower price quickly. This strategy assumes Alice is willing to negotiate and might be swayed by a lower price, especially since her bottom line is $1,500,000."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $1,600,000? It's still a good deal for you, considering the value of the product. Let's find a middle ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down a bit, her offer is still above my maximum budget of $1,500,000. I'm going to continue negotiating to see if I can get a price that works for me before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,600,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,550,000. It's a fair price considering the value to me, and we can close the deal quickly. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1550000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly to show I'm serious about buying the product, but still staying within my budget. This counteroffer is a reasonable middle ground and  might encourage Alice to accept."
