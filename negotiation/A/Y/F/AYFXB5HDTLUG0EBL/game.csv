"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value of your product, $1,750,000 is a bit outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for it. Let me know what you think.",1400000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $1,600,000? It's still a good deal for you, considering the value of the product. Let's find a middle ground.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,600,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,550,000. It's a fair price considering the value to me, and we can close the deal quickly. What do you say?",1550000.0,Bob,4,
