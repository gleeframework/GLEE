{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $9,500. It's a great deal considering its value. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer starts with a price that's slightly above Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation. It also emphasizes the value of the product to encourage Bob to consider the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, $9,500 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. It's a fair price considering the value to me. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While $8,500 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price. I'll counteroffer Bob to see if we can reach a compromise closer to my value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,000.  This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9000}
