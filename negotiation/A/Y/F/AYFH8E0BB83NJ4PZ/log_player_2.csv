"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a unique opportunity to acquire a high-value item that I'm confident you'll love. I'm willing to part with it for a price of $900,000. This is a great deal, considering its worth to you is $1,000,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above your desired price range. There's room for negotiation to save money.  Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less.  Given its value to me, I'd be happy to purchase it for $850,000.  This would still give you a healthy profit and allows me to acquire the product at a price that aligns with my budget. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 850000}

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit far from my target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $875,000. This is a fair compromise that still gives me a decent profit. What do you think?

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is $875,000.  This is still a good deal for Bob as it's below his maximum budget of $1,000,000.  While Bob could continue negotiating, there's a risk Alice will walk away or increase her price. Accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product at a decent price and avoids potentially losing the deal altogether."
