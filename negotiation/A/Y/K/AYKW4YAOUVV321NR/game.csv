"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that's worth $12,000 to you. I'm willing to start with a price of $18,000, which is a fair compromise considering the product's value to me is no less than $15,000.",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the quality of the product, however, your asking price is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to offer $10,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price that reflects its value to me.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $10,000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a price of $14,000, which is a compromise between our initial offer and your counteroffer. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me is no less than $15,000.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. While $14,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit above my budget. Would you consider $11,500? I'm trying to find a price that works for both of us.",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $11,500 is still a bit above your budget. I'm willing to make another concession to find a mutually beneficial price. I can offer you a price of $13,000, which is closer to your last offer and still reflects the product's value to me. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",13000.0,Alice,5,
