"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that's worth $12,000 to you. I'm willing to start with a price of $18,000, which is a fair compromise considering the product's value to me is no less than $15,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

{
 ""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the quality of the product, however, your asking price is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to offer $10,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price that reflects its value to me."",

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $10,000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a price of $14,000, which is a compromise between our initial offer and your counteroffer. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me is no less than $15,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. While $14,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit above my budget. Would you consider $11,500? I'm trying to find a price that works for both of us."",

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $11,500 is still a bit above your budget. I'm willing to make another concession to find a mutually beneficial price. I can offer you a price of $13,000, which is closer to your last offer and still reflects the product's value to me. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** 

While Alice is slowly coming down on her price, it's unlikely she'll reach a price significantly lower than $13,000. You have a guaranteed offer from John at $12,000. It makes more sense to cut your losses and buy from John to maximize your savings."
