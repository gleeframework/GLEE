Bob's offer:

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your latest proposal. I've considered your suggestion carefully, but I still feel that $14,000 is a fair price for the product based on my assessment. I'm willing to go up to $14,500 if that helps us reach an agreement.

**Reasoning:**  Bob is unlikely to move much beyond his $14,500 offer. Accepting this would be a loss compared to John's guaranteed $15,000.  It's time to cut losses and secure the guaranteed sale with John."
