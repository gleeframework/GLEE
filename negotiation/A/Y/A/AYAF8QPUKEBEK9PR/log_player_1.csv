Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $170 for it, but I'm open to negotiation."", ""product_price"": 170}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($150) but still somewhat realistic, leaving room for negotiation. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** Showing willingness to negotiate makes Bob more likely to engage and potentially offer a counter-price. 
* **Knowing My Alternative:** I'm aware that I can sell to John for $150, so I won't accept any offers below that."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product, but I'm only willing to pay up to $120 for it. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** Bob's offer of $120 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Counteroffer is Necessary:** I need to counter-offer to try and get a price closer to my desired range. 
* **Selling to John is a Backup:** While I can sell to John for $150, I'm willing to try and negotiate further with Bob, as I might be able to get a better price than that."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. While I appreciate your interest, $120 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $140, considering the value of the product. Let me know if you're open to that."", ""product_price"": 140}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer:** I'm making a counter-offer to Bob, showing willingness to negotiate but not going too low.
* **Moderate Price:** $140 is still higher than Bob's offer but lower than my starting price, demonstrating flexibility.
* **Reasoning:** I'm highlighting the product's value to justify my counter-offer. 
* **Open to Agreement:** I'm ending with a question to encourage Bob to respond and potentially reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your response, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I am still looking to purchase the product at a price closer to my budget. Would you consider $130? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Still Too Low:** Even though Bob has increased his offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **Counteroffer is Still a Possibility:** While I can sell to John for $150, I'm still hopeful that I can get a better price from Bob. I will make a final counteroffer to see if we can reach a compromise.
* **Final Counteroffer:**  I believe I can still increase Bob's offer a little bit by making a final counter-offer, even though it's getting close to my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget concerns.  I'm willing to go down to $135, which is a significant reduction from my initial asking price. I truly believe this product would be a great value for you. This is my final offer."", ""product_price"": 135}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Counteroffer:** This is my last attempt to reach an agreement with Bob.
* **Slight Compromise:**  I'm lowering my price to $135, which is just above my minimum acceptable price of $130.  This shows a willingness to compromise, while still trying to get a reasonable price.
* **Finality:** I'm emphasizing that this is my final offer to create a sense of urgency and potentially encourage Bob to accept.
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the value of the product to persuade him to agree."
