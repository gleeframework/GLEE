"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $18,000 is a bit out of my price range.  I'm interested in the product, but I can't go higher than $10,000.  What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand that $10,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now willing to sell the product to you for $16,000. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,3,,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer,
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $16,000 is still more than I can afford. I'm prepared to pay $12,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I place on the product.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",12000.0,Bob,4,,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $12,000 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm now willing to sell the product to you for $14,500. This is my final offer, and I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product and the time we've spent negotiating. What do you think?",14500.0,Alice,5,,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer,
"Alice, I truly appreciate your flexibility, but $14,500 is still above what I can comfortably spend.  I'm going to stick to my last offer of $12,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the value of the product and our back-and-forth. Let's see if we can find common ground.",12000.0,Bob,6,,
