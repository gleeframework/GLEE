Round 3
Alice's offer:

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to negotiate, but I'm still not willing to go below $10,500. However, I'm willing to make a small concession. I can meet you at $10,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000

At this point, Alice has met your price ceiling. There's no guarantee she'll go any lower, and you can already get the product for that price from John.  It's time to accept the offer."
