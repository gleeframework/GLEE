Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$1,500,000:** This offer is significantly higher than John's price, giving Bob a potential for a great deal. 
* **Rationale:** While there's a risk Bob will reject the offer, there's also a chance he values the product much higher than $1,500,000.  By aiming high, I maximize my potential profit. 
* **If Bob rejects:** I have a guaranteed backup with John, so I'm not taking a huge gamble. 

This strategy balances the risk of a rejection with the potential for a much higher return."
