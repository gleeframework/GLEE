"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm confident you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $120. It's a fair price considering its value and uniqueness. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  It's always worth trying to negotiate and potentially get a better price than $120. Since you have 10 rounds, rejecting the initial offer gives you more room to try and lower the price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you highlighting the uniqueness of the product.  While I'm definitely interested,  $120 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $90 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 90}
```"

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $120 is a bit steep for you. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $105. It's still a great value for the product, and I'm confident you'll love it. What do you think?

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. $105 is getting closer, but I'm still hoping we can find a price that works for both of us.  I'm willing to go to $95.  Let's see if we can make this happen."", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $95 is still a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to make another concession. I'm thinking of a price of $102.50. It's the lowest I'm willing to go, but I'm confident it's still a fair price for the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $102.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $102.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you continuing to work with me.  While I'm really interested in the product,  $102.50 is still a bit out of my range. I'm prepared to pay $97.50,  which is a fair middle ground between our last offers. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 97.5}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $97.50 is still a bit of a compromise for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I'm thinking of a price of $100.25. It's the closest I can get to your offer without going below my minimum value for the product. What do you think?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100.25

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $98.75 is a good compromise, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go below my minimum value for the product. I'm thinking of a price of $99.50. It's the highest I'm willing to go, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle. What do you think?
