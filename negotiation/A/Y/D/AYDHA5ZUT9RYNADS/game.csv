"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a mutually beneficial deal.

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm. However, $1,200,000 is still a bit higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me, and I believe it's a win-win situation for both of us. Let me know your thoughts.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still confident that the product's value to you justifies a higher price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's worth, and I believe it's a good opportunity for both of us to come to an agreement.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,100,000 is still outside my comfort zone. I'm willing to go up to $1,050,000. This is a significant move from my previous offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",1050000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to move closer to my original price. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $1,050,000. I'm willing to make another compromise and offer it to you for $1,080,000. This is the highest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's still a fair reflection of the product's value to you.",1080000.0,Alice,5,
