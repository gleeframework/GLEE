"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a mutually beneficial deal. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is a good starting point, but it's still significantly higher than what I'm willing to pay. It's worth negotiating to see if I can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm. However, $1,200,000 is still a bit higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me, and I believe it's a win-win situation for both of us. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still confident that the product's value to you justifies a higher price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's worth, and I believe it's a good opportunity for both of us to come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down in price, $1,100,000 is still more than I'm willing to pay. I'm going to continue to negotiate, aiming for a price closer to my initial counteroffer of $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,100,000 is still outside my comfort zone. I'm willing to go up to $1,050,000. This is a significant move from my previous offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to move closer to my original price. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $1,050,000. I'm willing to make another compromise and offer it to you for $1,080,000. This is the highest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's still a fair reflection of the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,080,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,080,000 is getting closer to my target price. While I'd prefer to pay less, there's a good chance that further negotiations will take longer and might not result in a significantly lower price. Additionally, there's the risk that Alice could reject my counteroffer and we could end up with a higher price. It's also important to consider the value of the product and the fact that I'm getting a better deal than the $1,500,000 offered by John. Accepting this offer minimizes my risk and saves me a significant amount of money."
