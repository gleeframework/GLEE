Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 95} 
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $95. This leaves room for negotiation, while still getting me closer to my target of $100. It also acknowledges that the product is worth more to Bob, but I'm not giving it away for cheap."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

Bob's offer is still too low. I'll reject it and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 90} 
```

I'm lowering my price to $90. It's a compromise, but still above Bob's offer. Hopefully, he'll see the value in the product and accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $87.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $87.5 is closer to my desired price and higher than John's offer. It's time to accept the offer."
