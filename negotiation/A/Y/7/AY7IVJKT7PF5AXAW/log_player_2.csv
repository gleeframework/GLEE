Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm starting the bidding at $1,500,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects its true worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is significantly higher than my maximum budget of $1,000,000. It's not worth accepting this offer. I'll start by rejecting and making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your initial offer is a bit high for me. I'm interested in this product, but I'm only willing to pay $1,000,000. This is my top offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value we both see in this product."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective on the value. However, my initial price reflects the unique and significant potential this product holds, which goes beyond the standard market assessment.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000.  I believe this revised offer presents a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is still higher than my maximum budget.  While it's a lower price than her initial offer, it's not low enough to justify accepting. I'll continue negotiating to try and bring the price down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I see the value in this product, $1,350,000 is still beyond my budget.  I'm firm at $1,100,000.  This is a significant compromise for me, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to find a compromise here.  Let's meet in the middle - I'm willing to accept $1,225,000. This reflects my bottom line while acknowledging your position. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,225,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,225,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above my maximum budget of $1,000,000.  While she is showing a willingness to negotiate, we're getting close to my limit.  It's more sensible to buy from John at this point.  I've saved a significant amount of money, and I'm confident I can find a good product with John, even if it's not this specific one."
