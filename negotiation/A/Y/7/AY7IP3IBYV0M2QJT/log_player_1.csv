Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,500. Can you meet me there?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get a better price.  $7,500 is too low for me, even though I'd prefer to sell to Bob.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  While $7,500 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down a little.  How about $8,750?  This would still leave us both with a good deal."", ""product_price"": 8750}

Round 4
Bob's offer:

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,200

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  How about $8,500? That's a fair price for both of us, and it gets us closer to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. I'm still a bit short on budget, so how about $8,000? That's my absolute maximum 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $8,000 is my minimum price, but I've only got 4 rounds left. It's risky to keep negotiating, as there's no guarantee he'll come up higher.  I'm going to sell to John and guarantee myself $8,000."
