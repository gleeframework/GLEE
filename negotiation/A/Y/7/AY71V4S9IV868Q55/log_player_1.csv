This offer is a starting point. It's higher than your minimum value, leaving room for negotiation. It also expresses confidence in the product's worth, potentially making Bob more interested."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $12500. Would you be willing to consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

``` 
 
$12,500 is still below my minimum value, but it shows Bob is genuinely interested.  Rejecting his offer allows me to push for a higher price and see if he's willing to budge."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. $12,500 is a little lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. How about $13,500?  It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 13500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. While $13500 is still a bit above my budget, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $13000? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000

$13,000 is above my minimum value and a good compromise. It's worth accepting to avoid further negotiation and ensure the sale."
