"I appreciate the offer, but I think $1,300,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $1,150,000 for the product. I believe this price is more in line with its value.",1150000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,150,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $1,250,000.  This price still represents a significant value to you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired return.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1,250,000, but I'm still not convinced that's the best price. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
