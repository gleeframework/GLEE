"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}
```

I'm starting with a high price to see if Bob is willing to pay something close to my minimum.  I'm hoping he'll counteroffer, but if he doesn't, I'm ready to walk away and sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is too low.  It's below my minimum, so I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 160}

I'm lowering my price a bit to show I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm still holding out for a price that's closer to my minimum.  I think $160 is a fair compromise."

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $130 is closer to my minimum, it's still too low.  I'm going to counteroffer again, hoping to find a price we can both agree on."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.
