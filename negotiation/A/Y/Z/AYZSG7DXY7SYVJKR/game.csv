,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  $90 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now.  How about $75?  I'm really interested in this product and I think we can find a price that works for both of us.",75.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $75 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we try $82? It's a great compromise that still benefits both of us.",82.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $82 is still a little too high for me.  How about $78?  I'm really hoping we can close this deal and I think this is a fair price for both of us.",78.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $78 is still a bit lower than my target price, but I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $81? It's a great compromise that still gives me a decent profit, and I think it's a fair price for both of us.",81.0,Alice,5,
