"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this item for $115. I think you'll find it's a great deal for something of this value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
While $115 is a decent price, I can likely get it for less by negotiating with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm interested, but I'm hoping to get it for a bit less. How about $105? I'm sure we can find a price we're both happy with."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest. How about we split the difference and settle at $110? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
 
$110 is a good price for the product, and Alice is clearly willing to negotiate. I don't want to risk losing the deal by going lower and having Alice walk away."
