"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $950,000 is still a bit too low for me. Let's meet in the middle - I'm willing to accept $1,050,000. This is still a great deal for you, as you'll be getting the product at a significantly lower price than its value to you. Let me know what you think.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
