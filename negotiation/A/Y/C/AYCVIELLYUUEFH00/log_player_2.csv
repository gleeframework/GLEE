"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to purchase a high-value product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is too high. We can try to negotiate a lower price or buy from John for $800,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. This product has piqued my interest, but the price point is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to purchase it for $650,000. Let me know if that works for you."",
""product_price"": 650000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive starting point:** Starting with a significantly lower offer (approximately 28% below Alice's asking price) leaves room for negotiation while still conveying strong interest. 
* **Polite and professional tone:**  Maintaining a positive and respectful tone throughout the negotiation is crucial for a successful outcome. 
* **Clear communication:**  The counteroffer clearly states the desired price and invites further discussion.

This strategy aims to establish a lower anchor price and gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $650,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can do $800,000, which is still a great deal for you. Let me know if that's more to your liking. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:

**Reasoning:**

Alice has met our alternative price. It makes no sense to negotiate further or buy from John at the same price.  We successfully brought the price down to our target."
