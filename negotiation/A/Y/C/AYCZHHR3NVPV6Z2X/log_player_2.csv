Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $600,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,000,000. This is a fair price considering its worth to you is $800,000.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make another concession. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to offer the product to you for $900,000. This is a fair price considering its worth to you is $800,000, and it's a significant discount from my initial offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

It's time to cut bait and go with John.  Alice is very unlikely to go below $900,000, and you're better off taking the guaranteed $800,000 from John than risking further negotiation."
