Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  I believe it holds significant value for someone like you, and I'm confident you'll find it well worth the investment. I'm asking for $1,750,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 1750000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since we know Bob values the product at $1,500,000 and we have a guaranteed buyer at that price, we can confidently start with a higher offer. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** The $1,750,000 price leaves room for potential negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, and we can still settle closer to our desired outcome.
* **Justification for Value:** The message emphasizes the product's value and Bob's potential benefit, subtly justifying the higher price.

**Important Note:** While John provides a safety net, aiming higher than Bob's perceived value carries a risk of rejection. However, the potential for increased profit makes it a calculated risk worth taking."
