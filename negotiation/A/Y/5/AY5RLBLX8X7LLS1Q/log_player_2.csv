"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this great product at a special price. I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is too close to your maximum budget. There's room for negotiation to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but that price is a bit high for me. Would you consider a lower price?"",
""product_price"": 70
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Start Low:**  Negotiation often benefits from starting with a lower offer than your target price. This leaves room for bargaining and shows Alice you're serious about a deal.
* **Polite and Interested:** Maintaining a positive tone keeps the conversation open and encourages Alice to continue negotiating. 
* **Target Price in Mind:** I'm aiming for a price well below Alice's initial offer and closer to her value of $80."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a better price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $70. I can do $82.50, and that's as low as I can go. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $82.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $82.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Good Deal:** Alice's offer of $82.50 is a significant discount from her initial price and a good deal considering her product value of $80. 
* **Limited Time:**  We're already in round 3, and Alice is signaling this is her lowest price. Continuing to negotiate might risk losing the deal. 
* **Acceptable Price:** While I could try for a slightly lower price,  $82.50 is well within my budget and a satisfactory outcome."
