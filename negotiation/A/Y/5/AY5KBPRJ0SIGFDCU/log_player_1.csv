Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $14,000. I think it's a fair price that reflects its value. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($12,000) as possible while still exceeding our minimum acceptable price ($15,000).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $14,000 leaves some room for Bob to potentially negotiate a slightly higher price, bringing us closer to our desired profit. 
* **Secure a Sale:**  While we have a guaranteed buyer in John, selling to Bob quickly and efficiently is preferable. This offer balances a strong potential profit with a reasonable chance of acceptance."
