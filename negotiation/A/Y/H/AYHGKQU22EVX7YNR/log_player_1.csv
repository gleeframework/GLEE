Round 2
Bob's offer:

**Reasoning:**

Bob has consistently been unwilling to meet near the product's value to you.  While he's inching closer, his ""final offer"" of $1,100,000 is still significantly less than what John is offering. It's unlikely Bob will drastically increase his offer in the remaining rounds to make it worth the risk of continuing the negotiation."
