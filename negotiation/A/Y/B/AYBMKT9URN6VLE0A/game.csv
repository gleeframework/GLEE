"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $13,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $13,750? It's a fair price that's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to keep my profit margin.",13750.0,Alice,3,

"I'm getting closer to the price I'm comfortable with. How about we meet in the middle at $13,500? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'd be happy to buy the product at this price.",13500.0,Bob,4,
