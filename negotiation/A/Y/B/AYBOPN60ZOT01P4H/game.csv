"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but I'm hoping to get a bit more for it. How about $130?",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $130 is still a bit out of my price range.  I'm sticking with my offer of $100.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",100.0,Bob,4,

"Alice, I'm happy to meet in the middle, but $115 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending.  How about $110?  Let's see if we can close this deal.",110.0,Bob,6,
