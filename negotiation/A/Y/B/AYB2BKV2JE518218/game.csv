"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate your product, $15,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $11,000 for it, considering my maximum is $12,000. Let me know what you think.",11000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and respect your budget constraints. I am willing to meet you halfway and propose a price of $12,500 for the product. This allows us both to feel satisfied with the transaction. Let me know if this proposal works for you.",12500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  $12,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm comfortable with $12,000, which is my absolute maximum. This would be a fair deal for both of us, allowing me to stay within budget and you to sell the product.  Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Bob,4,
