"Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the value you see in this product, $1200000 is a bit higher than my initial budget. I'm prepared to offer $950000 for it, which I believe is a fair price considering its potential.  I'm confident we can reach an agreement that works for both of us. Let's keep talking!",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $950000 is a bit lower than I'd hoped for, I'm willing to come down to $1050000 to see if we can find common ground. This price still reflects the significant value of the product for your business. Let's continue this discussion.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1050000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1000000, which I believe reflects a fair balance between our needs.  Let's see if we can make this work.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
