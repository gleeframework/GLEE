"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product that I believe will be incredibly valuable to you.  I'm starting with a price of $1200000, which reflects its significant worth.  I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial price point within these negotiations.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is high, but it's a good starting point. You have a lot of room to negotiate and should aim for a lower price. It's too early to buy from John, as you haven't explored Alice's willingness to compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the value you see in this product, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than my initial budget. I'm prepared to offer $950,000 for it, which I believe is a fair price considering its potential.  I'm confident we can reach an agreement that works for both of us. Let's keep talking!"", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant reduction from Alice's initial price, showing your serious intent to negotiate. It's still above Alice's minimum, suggesting room for further negotiation. By offering a concrete price and framing it as a ""fair"" value, you're establishing a clear starting point for the next round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $950000 is a bit lower than I'd hoped for, I'm willing to come down to $1050000 to see if we can find common ground. This price still reflects the significant value of the product for your business. Let's continue this discussion. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to your initial counteroffer, but there is still room to negotiate.  At $1,050,000, the deal is not yet good enough for you. You still have several rounds left, and you should aim for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,050,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,000,000, which I believe reflects a fair balance between our needs.  Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

You're showing Alice that you're serious about negotiating a deal but still pushing for a lower price. This counteroffer is a smaller step than the previous one, demonstrating that you're getting closer to a potential agreement while also leaving room for further negotiations if needed."
