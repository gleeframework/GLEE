{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price.  While $110 is better than selling to John, I think I can do better."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $110 is a little too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $120?  It's still a great deal for you, and it gets us closer to a deal."", ""product_price"": 120}

Round 4

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget, but $115 is still a bit too low for me. Let's meet halfway between our last offers at $117.50. That's a great price for you, and it gets us closer to a deal."", ""product_price"": 117.5}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While I would have preferred $117.50, $116 is still a good deal for me, and I'm starting to run out of time.  It's also more than I would get by selling to John."
