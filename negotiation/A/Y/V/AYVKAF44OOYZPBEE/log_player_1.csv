Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $11,999. I believe it offers significant value, and this price reflects its worth. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 11999
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice's primary goal is to maximize her profit. Since she has a guaranteed offer from John for $12,000, she needs to aim higher with Bob.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** While starting high, the offer leaves a small window for Bob to potentially counter-offer if he's highly interested. 
* **Strategic Pricing:**  The price of $11,999 is just below Alice's minimum and significantly above Bob's perceived value. This increases the chance of Bob accepting, thinking he's getting a slight ""deal"" while still netting Alice a higher profit than John's offer."
