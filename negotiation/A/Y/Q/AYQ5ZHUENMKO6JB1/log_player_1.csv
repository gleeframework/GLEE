Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of the product, but I believe we can reach a more agreeable price. How about $1600000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer for now. While $1,600,000 is a good starting point, I still think I can get a better price. I have 8 more rounds to negotiate with Bob, so I want to see if I can push for a price closer to my initial asking price."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit higher than that. I'm willing to come down to $1,650,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  While $1,625,000 is closer to my desired price, I still think I can push for a bit more. I've got 6 rounds left to negotiate with Bob and don't want to settle too quickly."

Round 6
Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. We've been going back and forth for a few rounds now, and while I'd love to get closer to my initial asking price, $1,630,000 is a solid deal. It's more than what John is offering and allows for a good profit.  With only four rounds left, I don't want to risk losing out on this deal."
