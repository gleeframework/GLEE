Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but the price is a little high for me. Would you consider $900,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While I understand your perspective on the price, the value this product brings is truly exceptional. I could come down to $1,025,000, which I believe is a very strong offer considering the potential return on investment you'll see. This is my best offer."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me a bit on the price.  To be honest, $950,000 is where I need to be to make this work.  Let me know if that's doable for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is steadily increasing his offer, indicating a strong interest. We're still significantly above John's offer, so it's worth pushing a bit further to try and secure a better deal with Bob."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

""message"": ""Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I respect that. Let's meet in the middle. How about $980,000? This reflects my bottom line while still offering you significant value."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me in the middle somewhat.  How about we split the difference and call it $965,000?  This would be a great deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $965,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $965,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  Bob is clearly trying to meet in the middle, and $965,000 is a significant profit margin above your minimum acceptable price. It's unlikely you'll squeeze much more out of him, and there's always the risk he walks away. Accepting now secures a very good deal."
