It's always good to try and negotiate, especially when you have a backup option. You can potentially get a better price by rejecting and making a counteroffer."

I'm starting with a significantly lower counteroffer to test the waters and see if Alice is willing to negotiate.  This leaves room for compromise while still being within my budget."

Alice has come down a bit, but I still think there's room for a better price. I'll try another counteroffer to see if we can get closer to my desired price."

I'm increasing my counteroffer slightly to show good faith, but still leaving room for negotiation. This should give Alice some incentive to compromise while still staying within my budget."

Alice has come down significantly from her initial price, and while I would prefer a slightly lower price, it's close enough to my desired price point that it makes sense to accept the offer.  It's better than the price from John and allows me to save some money."
