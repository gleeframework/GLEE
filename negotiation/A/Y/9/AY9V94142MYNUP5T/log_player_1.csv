Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value and would be a worthwhile investment for you. I'm asking for $18,000. Let me know if you're interested, and we can discuss further."", 
""product_price"": 18000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Start High:** It's always better to start with a higher offer. This leaves room for negotiation and gives the impression that the product holds high value.
* **Anchor Price:**  By offering the product at $18,000, we are setting a high anchor price. Even if Bob negotiates down, it's less likely he'll go below our minimum of $12,000. 
* **Alternative in Mind:** We know we have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $12,000, so we're not desperate. This allows for a more confident and potentially profitable negotiation with Bob. 

**Important Note:** This is just an initial offer.  How the negotiation proceeds will depend on Bob's response and willingness to pay."
