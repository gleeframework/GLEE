{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  $1,400,000 is higher than what Bob is willing to pay, but still below your minimum acceptable price.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  This gives Bob some room to bargain, which can make him feel more involved in the process.
* **It demonstrates your willingness to be flexible:**  This shows Bob that you are serious about selling the product, but also that you're willing to compromise to some extent. 

**Important considerations:**

* **Your negotiation strategy:**  You can choose to be more aggressive or more passive in your negotiation style.
* **Bob's personality:**  If you know Bob is a tough negotiator, you might want to start with a lower offer to leave more room for negotiation.
* **Time constraints:**  If you need to sell the product quickly, you might be more willing to accept a lower offer."

# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000.

While $1,300,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm not ready to accept it just yet. I want to see if I can get closer to my target price of $1,400,000."
