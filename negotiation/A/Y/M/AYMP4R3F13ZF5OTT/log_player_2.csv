"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You're trying to save as much money as possible, so rejecting Alice's offer and making a counteroffer is the logical first step.  You can potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1300000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $1,300,000 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,350,000?  That's a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

At this point, Alice has moved closer to your desired price. Accepting her offer for $1,350,000 saves you $50,000 compared to buying from John.  While you could try to negotiate further, the risk of her rejecting your counteroffer and potentially increasing the price again is not worth the potential $50,000 savings."
