"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I'm excited to present our flagship product, which I believe would significantly enhance the value and efficiency of your operations. Given its exceptional quality and the unique benefits it offers, I understand its true worth to be $15,000. However, to facilitate a smoother transaction and considering your needs, I am offering this remarkable opportunity to you at a special introductory price of $14,000. This is an exclusive offer tailored specifically for you, and I trust it aligns well with your budget while securing a substantial value for your investment. Should you decide to proceed, please let me know, and we can arrange for the immediate delivery and setup of the product. I look forward to your positive response. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still significantly higher than your maximum budget of $15,000 and her product's actual worth to her ($12,000). By rejecting her offer, you open the possibility of negotiating a lower price or proceeding with your backup option of buying from John for $15,000."
