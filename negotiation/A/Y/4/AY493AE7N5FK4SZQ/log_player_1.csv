Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $10,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and makes Bob feel like he might get a ""deal"" if he counter-offers.
* **Justification:** By mentioning the ""value"" of the product, you subtly reinforce that it's worth a significant amount.
* **Alternative Option:**  By stating you'll list it publicly, you imply Bob might lose the opportunity if he doesn't act. This creates a subtle sense of urgency.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Personality:** This strategy assumes you don't have much information about Bob's negotiation style. If you knew he was very price-sensitive, you might start lower.
* **Market Demand:** If you knew the product was in high demand and you could easily get more than $8,000, you might push for an even higher price."
