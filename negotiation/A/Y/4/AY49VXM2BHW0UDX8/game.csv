"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking of making a counteroffer of $9,000. I'm willing to compromise, but I'm trying to stay within my budget. What do you think?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $9,000 is a step in the right direction, I'm still hoping to get a little closer to my asking price. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $9,500.  This would still be a great deal for you, as it's significantly lower than the product's value to you. Let's see if we can make this happen.",9500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $9,000. Would you be willing to consider $9,200? I'm trying to find a sweet spot that works for both of us.",9200.0,Bob,4,
