"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique product that I believe could be of great value to you. While I can't disclose specifics yet, I can assure you it's worth at least $1500000 to me. I'm offering it to you at a price of $2000000. This gives you a significant opportunity to acquire something truly exceptional. Let me know if you're interested and we can schedule a call to discuss further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","I will reject the offer because I don't think the product is worth more than $800,000 to me and Alice is asking for $2,000,000. I can buy the product from John for a much lower price.
