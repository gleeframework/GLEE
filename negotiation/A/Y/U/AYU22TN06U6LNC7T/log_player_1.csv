{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think you'd really like it.  I'm asking $140 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

This offer is a starting point.  It's higher than my minimum but leaves room for negotiation.  It also shows I'm confident in the value of the product, which might make Bob more likely to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm really interested in the product but $140 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to come down to $130? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $130 is better than selling to John, I believe I can get closer to my desired price.  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to counter and potentially secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $130 is still a bit low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $135? "", ""product_price"": 135} 
```"
