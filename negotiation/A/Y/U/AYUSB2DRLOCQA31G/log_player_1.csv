{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $110. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  $110 is higher than Bob's $80 valuation, giving him room to negotiate if he wishes. 
* **It's below your minimum:** $110 is still above your minimum of $120, ensuring you make a profit.
* **It leaves room for counteroffers:**  If Bob counteroffers, you have space to negotiate while still making a profit.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing your profit and keeping the negotiation open."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $90 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $120. Accepting Bob's offer would result in a loss for me.  

By rejecting his offer, I can:

* **Counter with a higher price:** I can make a counteroffer closer to my desired price point.
* **Potentially get closer to a mutually agreeable price:**  By continuing to negotiate, I might be able to find a price that both Bob and I are comfortable with.
* **Maintain my position:**  Rejecting the offer shows Bob that I'm not desperate to sell at his price, increasing my negotiating leverage.

**Next Steps:**

I'll send a counteroffer to Bob, aiming to find a price that is both profitable for me and acceptable to him."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $90 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. How about $100?  That's still a great price for this product, and it's a fair compromise. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting Bob halfway:** My counteroffer of $100 is exactly halfway between my previous offer of $110 and Bob's offer of $90. This demonstrates a willingness to compromise and makes it seem like I'm trying to reach a fair agreement.
* **Reasoning and justification:**  I emphasize the value of the product and try to persuade Bob that $100 is still a good deal for him.
* **Maintaining a profitable price:**  $100 is still above my minimum price of $120, ensuring I make a profit even if Bob accepts my counteroffer.

This counteroffer aims to strike a balance between being flexible and ensuring a profitable outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $100 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $95, and I think that's a fair price for both of us. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob has moved closer to my desired price, $95 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $120.  Accepting his offer would mean a loss for me.

Selling to John guarantees me a profit of $120, which is my minimum target.  This is a much safer and more profitable option than continuing to negotiate with Bob, as there's no guarantee that we'll reach a mutually agreeable price. 

**Reasoning:**

* **Profit maximization:**  Selling to John secures the highest possible profit for me.
* **Time and effort:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob could take more time and effort, and there's no guarantee of a successful outcome.
* **Avoiding potential losses:**  There's a risk that Bob might refuse any further counteroffers, leaving me with a product I can't sell for my desired price.

Selling to John is the most sensible decision in this situation, as it guarantees my profit goal and minimizes risk."
