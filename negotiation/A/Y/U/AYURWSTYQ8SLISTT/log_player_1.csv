Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of the strategy for Alice's offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Alice's Value:** The product is worth $1,500,000 to Alice (her minimum acceptable price).
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob (his maximum willingness to pay).
* **John's Guarantee:** Alice has a guaranteed sale of $1,500,000 to John.

**Optimal Strategy**

Alice's best strategy is to offer the product to Bob for a price slightly below his maximum willingness to pay. This maximizes her potential profit while ensuring Bob accepts the offer.

**Offer to Bob**

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product at a special price of $1,195,000. I believe it holds significant value for your needs and this offer reflects my commitment to making this a worthwhile deal for you."", ""product_price"": 1195000}
```

**Why this strategy works:**

* **Profit Maximization:** Alice aims for the highest price Bob is likely to accept, netting a profit of $695,000 over her minimum.
* **Securing the Sale:** Offering a price significantly lower than Bob's perceived value increases the chance of acceptance.
* **Time Value:**  A quick sale to Bob avoids potential delays associated with negotiating or waiting for John's payment.

**Important Note:** While Alice has a guaranteed offer from John, closing deals can sometimes involve unforeseen complexities. A slightly lower but confirmed sale to Bob might be preferable over potential delays or complications with John's offer."
