"Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $12,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, though. How about $16,000?  This still allows for a decent profit for me while being closer to your offer. Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",16000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but $16,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $14,000. I think this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us.",14000.0,Bob,4,
