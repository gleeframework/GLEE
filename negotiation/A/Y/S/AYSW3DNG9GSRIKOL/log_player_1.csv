Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $18,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 18000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value, hoping to maximize my profit. However, I'm also being reasonable, as I'm aware John is willing to pay the minimum I'm willing to accept. This strategy allows for negotiation while keeping my floor price secure."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price.  While I'm open to negotiation, I'm not willing to settle for a price that undervalues the product.  I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer, hoping to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $12,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, though. How about $16,000?  This still allows for a decent profit for me while being closer to your offer. Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 16000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but $16,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $14,000. I think this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While $14,000 is slightly below my ideal price, it's still a decent profit, and it avoids the risk of further negotiations or needing to sell to John for $15,000.  It's a good compromise to close the deal."
