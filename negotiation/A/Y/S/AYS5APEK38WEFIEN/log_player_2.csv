"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am excited to present you with our premium product, which I believe would significantly benefit your business. Given its value to you, I propose an initial offer of $950,000. This price reflects not only the product's worth but also includes some exclusive benefits and support services. I look forward to discussing this further with you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's still room for negotiation.  Bob should aim to lower the price closer to his maximum value. Rejecting the offer allows for a counteroffer and potential savings."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product and the added benefits, I'm currently looking to spend closer to $850,000.  This price would still be a significant gain for you, and it allows me to stay within my budget. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your budget constraints and am willing to negotiate. However, given the high demand for our product and the value it brings, I cannot reduce the price below $900,000. To accommodate your budget, I am including an additional year of maintenance and support services without increasing the price. Would you like to proceed with this offer? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $900,000 is still a better deal than buying from John for $1,000,000. While Bob could continue negotiating, the additional year of maintenance and support services add significant value. This makes accepting Alice's offer the most logical choice in this scenario."
