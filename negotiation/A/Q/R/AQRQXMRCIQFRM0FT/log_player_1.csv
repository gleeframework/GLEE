Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer is a good balance between maximizing my potential profit and ensuring Bob has an incentive to buy.  

Here's why:

* **Value to Bob:**  The product is worth $120 to Bob, so a $100 price is a good deal for him.
* **Value to me:**  This price is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $80.
* **John as backup:**  If Bob rejects, I can still sell to John for $80, minimizing any loss."
