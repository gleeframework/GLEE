While I aim to find a price that works for both of us, I'm valuing the product significantly higher than your current offer. I'd be willing to consider $1,600,000.

Bob's offer:

I believe that's a fair offer, considering the market value and my own budget constraints.  Let me know your thoughts.

Bob is nowhere near Alice's minimum acceptable price.  Continuing the negotiation is unlikely to yield a significantly better offer from Bob. It's time to cut losses and sell to John at the guaranteed price."
