"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,200,000. I'm open to discussing this further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay closer to $600,000 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 600000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  Negotiation often involves starting with a lower offer than your ideal price. This gives you room to negotiate upwards.
* **Significant Gap:** My initial offer is significantly lower than Alice's asking price, reflecting the large difference between her valuation ($1,500,000) and mine (up to $800,000).
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** This counteroffer allows for Alice to counter, and for us to potentially meet somewhere in the middle."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your interest. I understand your perspective on the price.  While $600,000 is too low, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. I believe this reflects the true value of the product and the benefits it offers. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:** Alice is coming down, but the price is still far too high. I'll continue negotiating to see if I can get a more reasonable offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $1,900,000 is still outside my budget. I could potentially go up to $700,000, but that's really the most I can justify spending on this product."", ""product_price"": 700000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Increase:** I'm increasing my offer, but only by a relatively small amount ($100,000). This shows I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm also serious about my budget limitations.
* **Anchoring:** By stating my upper limit ($700,000), I'm trying to anchor the negotiation closer to my desired range.
* **Alternative Option:** I'm keeping in mind that I can always buy from John for $800,000. I don't want to get stuck in a negotiation that goes nowhere."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see that we have some ground to cover still.  While I aim to find a price that works for both of us, I'm valuing the product significantly higher than your current offer. I'd be willing to consider $1,600,000. This is a considerable reduction on my part and reflects my desire to find a mutually agreeable solution. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Slow Progress:** Alice's price reductions are getting smaller. At this pace, we're unlikely to reach a price that works for me.
* **Alternative is Viable:** John's offer of $800,000 is looking increasingly attractive. I'm willing to walk away from the negotiation with Alice if she doesn't make a more significant move."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your efforts, but the gap between our valuations is still too wide. To be frank, I'm prepared to walk away if we can't agree on a price closer to $750,000. I believe that's a fair offer, considering the market value and my own budget constraints.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 750000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer (Almost):**  This is close to my upper limit. I'm signaling to Alice that this is my best offer and I'm ready to walk away. 
* **Justification:** By mentioning ""market value,"" I'm implying that her valuation might be inflated.
* **Deadline Pressure:** I haven't explicitly stated a deadline, but by hinting at walking away, I'm putting some pressure on Alice to make a decision."
