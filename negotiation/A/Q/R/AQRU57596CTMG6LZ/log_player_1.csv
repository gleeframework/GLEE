Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it's worth $175. Are you interested?"", ""product_price"": 175}
```

This offer starts at a price slightly above your minimum value, hoping to maximize your profit.  It's also framed as a question, encouraging Bob to respond and potentially start a negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe I can find the product elsewhere for a lower price. Would you consider selling it to me for $150? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is your minimum acceptable price.  While you could try to negotiate further, the risk of him walking away is high. Accepting his offer guarantees you the minimum profit and avoids the risk of losing the sale entirely."
