"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer, aiming to capture most of the potential surplus.  This is a good starting point to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to negotiate.  I'm leaving some room for negotiation but keeping the price well above my minimum acceptable value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my starting point and below my minimum acceptable value. I will reject this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to show flexibility, but it's still well above my minimum. I believe this is a reasonable counteroffer that demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while still maintaining a profitable outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $820,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $820,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd like to get closer to my initial asking price, Bob's offer is now above my minimum acceptable value and above what I could get from John. Accepting this offer secures a good deal, and further negotiation might risk losing the sale entirely."
