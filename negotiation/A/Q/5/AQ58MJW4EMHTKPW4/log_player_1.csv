I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,750,000. This is a reasonable starting point, as it's higher than John's offer, giving Bob an incentive to accept. However, it's not too high that it becomes unrealistic or discourages him from negotiating.  I'm confident that I can get a higher price than John's offer, and I'm willing to negotiate with Bob to see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement."
