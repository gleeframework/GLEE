"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $150 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. How about we try $80? That's my max for this product.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $80. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $120. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really appreciate the value this product brings.",120.0,Alice,3,
