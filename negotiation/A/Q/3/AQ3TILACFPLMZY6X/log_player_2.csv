"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth $120 to you, but we're starting our negotiation at $100. Let me know if this works for you or if you'd like to propose a counteroffer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible.  While $100 is better than $120, it's still more than the product is worth to Alice.  It makes sense to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate the offer, Alice, but $100 is still a bit high for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $90?  This would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position, and I'm willing to consider your proposal. For this round, I'll offer the product at $95. Let me know if this is acceptable or if you'd like to make another counteroffer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming to save as much as possible. While $95 is closer to his ideal price, it's still more than the product is worth to Alice. It's worth continuing the negotiation to try and get the price lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $95 is still a bit high for me.  Let's try $92.50 - that's a fair compromise and allows us both to get a good deal."", ""product_price"": 92.5} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your efforts to find a fair price, Bob. Considering our positions, I am willing to offer the product at $93.50. I believe this is a reasonable price for both of us. Please let me know if this works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $93.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $93.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value:** $93.50 is still within Bob's budget of $120 and is closer to his desired price than John's offer. 
* **Negotiation Progress:**  Alice has shown a willingness to compromise, and further negotiation might be time-consuming with uncertain results. 
* **Risk:**  There's a risk that if Bob rejects the offer, Alice might increase the price again or even end the negotiation. 

While Bob could try for a slightly lower price, accepting the current offer ensures he gets the product at a reasonable price within his budget."
