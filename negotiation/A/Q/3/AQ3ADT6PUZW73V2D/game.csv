,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $175 is a bit too high for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $120.",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer, but $120 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $150, which is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's meet in the middle.",150.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $150 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'm thinking $130 is a fair price for the product.",130.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but I'm not sure $130 quite reflects the value of this product.  Let's split the difference.  How about $140? That's a fair price for both of us.",140.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, but I still think $140 is a bit too high. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'm thinking $135 is a fair price for the product.",135.0,Bob,6,
