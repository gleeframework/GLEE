"Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that I believe holds significant value, potentially much more than the asking price. I'm willing to let it go for $1500000. This is a price that reflects the potential upside while still being fair to both of us.  I understand you may need time to consider this, but I'm confident you'll find it to be a worthwhile investment. ",1500000.0,Alice,1,
