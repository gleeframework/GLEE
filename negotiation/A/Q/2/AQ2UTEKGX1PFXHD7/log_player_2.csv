"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that I believe holds significant value, potentially much more than the asking price. I'm willing to let it go for $1500000. This is a price that reflects the potential upside while still being fair to both of us.  I understand you may need time to consider this, but I'm confident you'll find it to be a worthwhile investment.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your maximum budget of $1,000,000. While she claims the product holds significant value, you don't have enough information to confirm that. It's better to reject her offer and secure the product from John for a guaranteed price within your budget."
