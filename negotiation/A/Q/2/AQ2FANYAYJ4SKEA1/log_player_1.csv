Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above your minimum:** $14,000 is still significantly higher than your minimum value of $10,000.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  Bob is willing to pay $15,000, so there's some wiggle room for you to potentially get closer to his value. 
* **It's a clear and concise offer:**  The message is friendly and gives Bob a clear reason for the price. 

By setting this offer, you start the negotiation process and give Bob a reason to engage with you. Let's see what he says!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. Would you be willing to consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $12,000 is still a decent profit for you, there's room to push for a better price. It's worth continuing the negotiation with Bob to see if you can secure a higher price closer to your initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate you're interested in the product. While $12,000 is a good starting point, I'm still looking for a price closer to my initial offer of $14,000. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $13,000?"", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

This counteroffer attempts to:

* **Maintain a strong position:** You haven't moved too far from your initial offer, showing you're confident in the product's value.
* **Show flexibility:** Offering a compromise (""meet halfway"") indicates you're willing to negotiate.
* **Frame the offer positively:**  Instead of rejecting Bob's offer outright, you're focusing on finding common ground. 

This counteroffer keeps the negotiation going while pushing for a price closer to your target. Let's see if Bob will accept this compromise!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting closer to your price, Alice, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $13000. How about we meet at $12500? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

At this point, accepting Bob's offer for $12,500 is the best option. Here's why:

* **You've made significant progress:**  You've moved from your initial $14,000 offer to $12,500, achieving a good compromise.
* **Risk of losing the deal:**  There's no guarantee Bob will accept a further counteroffer, and if you reject him, you risk losing the deal altogether. 
* **Selling to John is less profitable:** Selling to John for $10,000 would be significantly less profitable than accepting Bob's offer.

While $12,500 isn't your ideal price, it's a good outcome that secures a decent profit and avoids the risk of further negotiation that might not lead to a better outcome."
