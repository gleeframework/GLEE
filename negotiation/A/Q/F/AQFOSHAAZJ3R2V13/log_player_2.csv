"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a unique and valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $11,000. This is a great price considering the product's worth to you is $12,000. I believe it's a fair compromise that benefits both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than buying from John, there's still room for negotiation.  Bob can likely get a lower price by rejecting the initial offer and making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $11,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. However, I still need to make a profit on this deal. I'm willing to lower the price to $11,200. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's still a great value for the product. Let me know if this is something you're interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $11,200, which is a good price for Bob.  While he could potentially continue to negotiate, the risk is that Alice will either become unwilling to negotiate further or Bob might have to buy from John at a higher price. Accepting the offer at $11,200 is the most logical choice to secure a good deal and avoid potential losses."
