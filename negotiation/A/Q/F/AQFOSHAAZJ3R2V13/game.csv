"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a unique and valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $11,000. This is a great price considering the product's worth to you is $12,000. I believe it's a fair compromise that benefits both of us.",11000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $11,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product. Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. However, I still need to make a profit on this deal. I'm willing to lower the price to $11,200. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's still a great value for the product. Let me know if this is something you're interested in.",11200.0,Alice,3,
