Bob should reject Alice's offer.  He can get the product for a lower price by continuing to negotiate with Alice or buying from John.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to explore other options."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $10,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This is still a good deal for you, as you're getting the product for less than its value to you, and it allows me to get a fair price. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000.

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  It's lower than John's price and closer to his desired price.  While further negotiation is possible, there's a risk Alice will reject future counteroffers or Bob might end up paying more with John. Accepting Alice's offer ensures a good deal and avoids potential complications."
