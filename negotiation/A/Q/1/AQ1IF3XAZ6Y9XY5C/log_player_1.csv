{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a unique opportunity for you, and I believe this price reflects its value. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

This offer gives me a good profit while leaving some room for negotiation. I believe Bob will be motivated to accept as the price is still well below his estimated value.  If he rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and adjust accordingly, always keeping in mind the $1,000,000 offer from John as my safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of your product, but given my budget constraints, I am only able to offer $1300000. I hope this proposal is within your consideration. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. While it's tempting to accept given my minimum target of $1,000,000, I want to try and secure a better price. I believe I can push for a higher number. I'll send a counteroffer that's closer to my initial offer, but still leaves room for further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but I need to counter with $1,350,000. This price still offers you a significant value and is closer to what I'm hoping for. I'm confident we can find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```

I've lowered my price slightly, but I'm still aiming for a comfortable profit. This counteroffer is a good compromise and could push Bob closer to accepting. I'm hoping to find a middle ground without risking a deal with John, especially with his offer still on the table."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your counteroffer. I'm willing to consider $1325000 as a potential price for your product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations and our current negotiation. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,325,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's counteroffer is close to my initial offer, and it's above my minimum goal of $1,000,000.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial $1,400,000,  there's no guarantee that continuing to negotiate will yield a better result.  It's a good deal, and I don't want to risk losing it entirely.  I'll accept Bob's offer."
