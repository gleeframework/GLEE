"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal, considering its value to you is $8,000. I'm confident you'll love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While it's a good deal for Alice, it's not worth it for Bob.  He can get the same product for $8,000 from John.  There's no reason to accept a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying. I'm happy to purchase the product for $8,000, which is the maximum I'm willing to spend. Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 8000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $8,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering it to you for $10,500. This is a fair price considering its value to you and the effort I've put into acquiring it. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy the product from John for $8,000.  Alice's counteroffer of $10,500 is still above Bob's maximum price, and John offers the same product for a lower price.  There's no reason for Bob to continue negotiating with Alice."
