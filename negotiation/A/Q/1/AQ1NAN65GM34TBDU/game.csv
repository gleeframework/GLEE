"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity to purchase your product. However, I am only able to pay up to $12000 for it. Would you consider accepting this offer?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're looking for a good deal, Bob. However, I have to make a living, and $12000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer it to you for $14000. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I'm still not able to go above $12000 for this product. Would you be willing to meet me at $13000?",13000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm getting a bit tired of going back and forth, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm not losing out on a good deal. I can do $13500, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,5,

"I understand your position, Alice. I'm willing to go up to $13000 for the product. This feels like a fair compromise for both of us.",13000.0,Bob,6,
