Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $115. I believe it's a fair price considering its value.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Alice's offer. While it's better than John's price, I want to see if I can get a better deal from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice, but I'm looking to pay a little less. How about $105? I think that's a fair price considering the value for both of us."", ""product_price"": 105}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your offer, Bob, but I'm looking for something a bit closer to my original price. How about $110? That's a $5 concession on my end. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to accept Alice's offer.  While I'd love to get it lower, $110 is a good price, especially since I only have 10 rounds to make a deal.  I don't want to risk losing this opportunity and having to buy from John at a higher price."
