"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is way too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $10,000 for it.  What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest.  While I understand your perspective, the value of this product is significant, and $10,000 is too low for me to consider. Could you meet me somewhere around $17,000?",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  However, $17,000 is still quite a bit more than I had in mind.  How about we settle around $13,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",13000.0,Bob,4,
