"Bob, I appreciate your interest! $80 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $90? It's a fair price, and it's still a great deal for you, considering you value it at $80.",90.0,Alice,3,

I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. How about we meet in the middle at $85?,85.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $85 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $90.  That's a fair price, and it's still a great deal for you considering you value the product at $80.  What do you say?",90.0,Alice,5,

"I'm still interested in the product, but I really can't go any higher than $85. That's my final offer.",85.0,Bob,6,
