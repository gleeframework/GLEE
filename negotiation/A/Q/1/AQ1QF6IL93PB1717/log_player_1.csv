{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal, considering it's worth at least $120 to me. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:** $100 is higher than the $80 Bob values the product at, but it's not too high that it would immediately deter him.
* **It's below your minimum:** $100 is still above your $120 minimum, so you're still making a profit.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** This allows for some flexibility in case Bob counters with a lower offer.

If Bob rejects, I'll need more information about his counteroffer to decide on my next move."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. I'm willing to pay $80 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $80 is better than nothing, it's significantly below my minimum of $120. It's also a lowball offer, and I can likely get more from Bob by counter-offering.  I'll counter-offer with a price closer to my desired range and see if we can find a compromise."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! $80 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $90? It's a fair price, and it's still a great deal for you, considering you value it at $80."", ""product_price"": 90}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. How about we meet in the middle at $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer of $85. While it's closer to my desired range, it's still below my minimum of $120.  It's important to remember that I have a guaranteed buyer in John who is willing to pay $120.  Therefore, I'm not under pressure to accept a low offer from Bob. 

I'll counter-offer with a price slightly higher than Bob's latest offer and see if we can reach a compromise that's closer to my desired price."

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $85 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $90.  That's a fair price, and it's still a great deal for you considering you value the product at $80.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 90}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I really can't go any higher than $85. That's my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm choosing to sell the product to John for $120. 

Here's why:

* **Meeting my minimum:**  This sale guarantees I meet my minimum price requirement of $120, ensuring I don't lose money.
* **No further negotiation:**  Bob has made it clear he won't go higher than $85.  Continuing to negotiate with him will likely result in more time wasted and potential for a lower price.
* **Guaranteed sale:** John is a guaranteed buyer, meaning I don't need to risk further negotiation with Bob. 

While I'd like to get more than $120, selling to John provides a certain outcome and avoids the potential for further delays or a lower price with Bob."
