"Bob, I understand your position, but $8,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,000, considering your enthusiasm for the product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $8,750 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,250, which is a fair compromise considering our previous offers.  This is my final offer, so let me know if you're interested.",9250.0,Alice,5,

"I understand that you're trying to reach a compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'll meet you at $8,750, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. I'm starting to think about other options, so I'd like to finalize a deal soon.",8750.0,Bob,6,
