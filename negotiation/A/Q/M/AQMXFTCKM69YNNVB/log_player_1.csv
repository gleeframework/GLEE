"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This gives me a good starting point, aiming for a profit. It's also not too high to immediately scare Bob away. I'll adjust my strategy based on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting to take the $12,000, I'm hoping to get a better price. I still have 8 rounds to negotiate, so I'm going to see if I can push Bob up a bit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

I'm going to counter with $13,000. This is a smaller decrease than Bob's offer, showing him I'm willing to negotiate but also not desperate to sell at his price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While it's getting closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a better price. I have 6 rounds left and I'm not yet at my absolute limit. I'll try one more counteroffer to see if I can push Bob higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500}
```

I'm offering $12,500. This is a small increase from Bob's last offer, but it's still a good price for me, and it shows Bob that I'm willing to compromise.  I only have 5 rounds left, so I'm getting closer to needing to make a decision."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell to John.  Bob's offer is getting too low, and I'm starting to run out of time. I'm not confident I can get a better offer from Bob in the remaining rounds, and I'm not willing to risk getting nothing. Selling to John guarantees me my minimum price."
