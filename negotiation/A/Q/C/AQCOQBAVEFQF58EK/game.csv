"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! $120 is a bit steep for me though.  Would you consider $60?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $60 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $90.  That's still a great price for a product that's worth much more to you.",90.0,Alice,3,
