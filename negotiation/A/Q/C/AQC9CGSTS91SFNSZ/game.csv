"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm really interested in the product, but $150 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending right now.  Would you be willing to come down to $110? ",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $150 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $110. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $130. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but I'm still a bit stretched at $130.  How about $125?  This would be a good deal for both of us, and I'd be happy to close the deal.",125.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $125 is still a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $130. However, I'm willing to give you a slight discount and offer you the product for $127. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",127.0,Alice,5,
