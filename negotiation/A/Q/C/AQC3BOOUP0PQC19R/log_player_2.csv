"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $95. I think it's a great deal for something of this quality. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

It's better to try to negotiate with Alice and see if you can get a lower price.  $95 is still a bit more than you're willing to pay, so it makes sense to see if you can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is a bit too low for me.  Could you do $90? It's a steal for this product! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90

$90 is still a bit higher than what you are willing to pay. It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice again to see if you can get a better deal."
