"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm starting with a high price of $1,000,000. This is ambitious, but it allows for room to negotiate downwards if necessary.  I'm assuming Bob might be willing to pay a premium if he values the product highly.  If he rejects, I'll use his counteroffer to gauge his interest and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $950,000 is a good price, I'm going to reject Bob's offer. I believe there's still room for negotiation, and I want to try and get closer to my initial asking price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 975000}
```

I'm going to counteroffer with $975,000. This is a compromise,  meeting Bob halfway from his last offer.  I'm hoping this will encourage him to close the deal, as it's a significant price for him, but still leaves some profit for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $925,000 is a good amount, I'm not willing to drop that low yet. Bob has shown he's serious about buying, but I'm going to try to see if I can push him closer to $950,000. I will counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

I'm going to stick with my previous price of $950,000. Bob has shown that he's willing to pay close to this amount, and I think we're reaching a point where a deal is possible. I'll wait to see how Bob responds to this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $920,000 is tempting, I'm still hoping to get closer to $950,000. With only four rounds left, I need to make a decisive move. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 940000}
```

I'm going to counteroffer with $940,000. This is a slight decrease from my previous offer, but I'm still aiming to get as close to $950,000 as possible.  I'm hoping this will incentivize Bob to accept and close the deal. If he rejects, I'll have to seriously consider selling to John in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $915,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $915,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

With only two rounds left, I need to make a decision quickly. While $915,000 is still a decent price, I don't think there's enough time to negotiate further and reach a mutually agreeable amount. I'm going to sell to John for $800,000. It's not my ideal price, but it's a guaranteed sale and I can't risk losing out on any money by waiting longer."
