"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,400,000. What are your thoughts?",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,400,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product.  This is my best offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value to both of us.",1250000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,250,000 is still below my target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for the product. I'm counteroffering at $1,350,000. This is a compromise that I believe is reasonable, considering the product's value to you.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $1,350,000 is closer, but still a bit out of my range.  I'm willing to go up to $1,300,000.  This is a significant commitment for me, and I hope you'll consider it.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to go up to $1,300,000, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target price. I'm counteroffering at $1,320,000. This is a compromise that I believe is reasonable, considering the product's value to you.",1320000.0,Alice,5,
