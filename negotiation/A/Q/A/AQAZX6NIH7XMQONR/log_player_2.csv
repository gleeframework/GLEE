"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,400,000. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Alice's initial offer is $1,400,000, which is still above Bob's maximum budget of $1,200,000.  There's room for negotiation, so rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for your offer, Alice. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,400,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product.  This is my best offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value to both of us."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,250,000 is still below my target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for the product. I'm counteroffering at $1,350,000. This is a compromise that I believe is reasonable, considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer of $1,350,000 is closer to his maximum budget, it's still above his target.  There's still room for negotiation, so rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue pushing for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $1,350,000 is closer, but still a bit out of my range.  I'm willing to go up to $1,300,000.  This is a significant commitment for me, and I hope you'll consider it."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to go up to $1,300,000, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target price. I'm counteroffering at $1,320,000. This is a compromise that I believe is reasonable, considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,320,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,320,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting close to his maximum budget, but Alice's offer of $1,320,000 is still higher than his target. He's already made several counteroffers, and it's likely that further negotiation will only result in small price reductions.  Since Bob has the option to buy from John for $1,200,000, it's more advantageous to take that option and secure the product at a lower price.  This eliminates the risk of further negotiation failing and Alice potentially rejecting any future counteroffers."
