"Hi Bob, I understand that $170 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $140. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love the product.",140.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thanks for coming down on the price. I appreciate the effort. How about we settle at $110? That's a fair price for both of us, I think.",110.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a fair price, and I appreciate that. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $110. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, and I can offer it to you for $130. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",130.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. $130 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go. Would you consider $115? That's my final offer, otherwise, I might have to check out other options.",115.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to find the best deal, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $115. I'm willing to make one more compromise, and I can offer it to you for $125. It's a great price, and I think you'll really love the product.",125.0,Alice,7,
