{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $175. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

This offer is a starting point.  I'm aiming for a price slightly above what I know the product is worth to Bob, but still below my minimum selling price to John. This leaves room for negotiation and increases the chance of a successful deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $175 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $125? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly below my minimum acceptable price. While I'm willing to negotiate, his offer is too low. I'll reject his counteroffer and make a new one."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $125 is unfortunately too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $150? This is still a good deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 150}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that $125 is a bit low for you, but $150 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $130? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer of $130 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm not going to go any lower.  It's time to move on and sell the product to John, who is willing to pay my minimum price."
