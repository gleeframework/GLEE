Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I like where this is going, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $105, but I can throw in a small bonus to sweeten the deal. How about we say $107? It's still a great price, and I think you'll be happy with the value you're getting.

Alice is clearly willing to negotiate, but she's unlikely to go much lower than $107.  At this point, accepting the offer gets you a good price and avoids the risk of the deal falling through."
