"Hi Alice,  $180 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $100 for it.  Let me know what you think.",100.0,Bob,2,,

"I understand that $100 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about we try $160?",160.0,Alice,3,,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer,
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $160 is still too high for me.  I'm ready to buy right now, but I can only go to $120. Let me know if that works for you.",120.0,Bob,4,,

"Alice, I'm really interested in your product and I appreciate your flexibility. How about we settle on $130? That's a good compromise for both of us.",130.0,Bob,6,,

"I'm not quite there yet, Bob. I think we can do better than $130. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $140 and $130, so how about $137.50?",137.5,Alice,7,,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer,
"Alice, we're getting close, but $137.50 is still a little more than I'm comfortable with. How about we split the difference again and meet at $135? That would be a fair compromise for both of us.",135.0,Bob,8,,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer,142.5
"I'm not quite ready to give up yet, Bob. I think we can do better than $135. Let's try to get a bit closer to my minimum price. How about $142.50?",142.5,Alice,9,,
