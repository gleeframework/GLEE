"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think you'll love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

The product is worth $100 to Bob, and Alice's offer is way too high. It's better to reject and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice,  $180 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $100 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $100 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about we try $160? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $160
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While $160 is a better offer than the initial $180, it's still too high for Bob's target of $100. There's still room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $160 is still too high for me.  I'm ready to buy right now, but I can only go to $120. Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 120}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to think we're getting closer, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $140, but I'm not going any lower than that. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $140 is better than the previous offers, Bob still has room to negotiate. He can likely get the price lower than that without risking losing the deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm really interested in your product and I appreciate your flexibility. How about we settle on $130? That's a good compromise for both of us."", ""product_price"": 130}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not quite there yet, Bob. I think we can do better than $130. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $140 and $130, so how about $137.50? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $137.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $137.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $137.5 is getting closer to Bob's target price, there's still room to negotiate further. He should try to get the price down a bit more before accepting."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, we're getting close, but $137.50 is still a little more than I'm comfortable with. How about we split the difference again and meet at $135? That would be a fair compromise for both of us."", ""product_price"": 135}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not quite ready to give up yet, Bob. I think we can do better than $135. Let's try to get a bit closer to my minimum price. How about $142.50? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $142.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $142.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

It's clear that Alice is not willing to go much lower than $140, and Bob's target is $100. There is a significant gap that might not close even with further negotiation. To save time and avoid potential risks, it's best for Bob to purchase the product from John for $100."
