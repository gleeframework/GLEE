It's not a good deal to buy the product for $12,000 when it's worth $10,000 to you. We will try to negotiate with Alice."

While $11,000 is closer to my budget, it's still higher than what I'm comfortable paying.  I'll try to negotiate further with Alice."

While Alice has come down in price, it's still a bit higher than what I'm willing to pay. Since John is willing to sell me the product for $10,000, I'll go ahead and buy from him."
