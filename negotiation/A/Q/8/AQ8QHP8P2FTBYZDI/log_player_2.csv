"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to start with a competitive price of $900,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is a decent price, there's still room for negotiation. Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible, so rejecting the initial offer and making a counteroffer is the best strategy to potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the starting point. However, I'm looking to acquire this product for a bit less. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your offer, Bob, but I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to consider a price of $875,000 for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $875,000 is a good compromise.  Bob can save $125,000 compared to buying from John.  While further negotiation is possible, the risk of Alice rejecting another counteroffer and potentially losing the deal to John outweighs the potential benefit of a slightly lower price."
