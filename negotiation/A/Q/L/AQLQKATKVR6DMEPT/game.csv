"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $90 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $105? I'm confident you'll find the product worth the price.",105.0,Alice,3,

I'm still not sure if I'm willing to go up to $105. How about we meet in the middle at $97.50? That's the highest I'm willing to go.,97.5,Bob,4,
