"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but that's a bit steep for me.  I'm interested, but I could only do it for a price closer to $80.",80.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. However, I have to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $120 for the product. How about we meet at $110?",110.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you coming down a bit, Alice.  However,  $110 is still more than I'm comfortable with. How about we split the difference at $95?",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go as low as $95, Bob. I've already compromised quite a bit. I can do $105, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. I'm starting to think about other options...",105.0,Alice,5,
