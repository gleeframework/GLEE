Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $140. I believe it will be highly valuable to you."", 
""product_price"": 140
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** We know the product is worth $150 to Bob.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $100.
* **Maximizing Profit:** By offering the product at $140, we maximize the chances of Bob accepting. This price is significantly less than his perceived value, giving him a good deal while still earning you a substantial profit.
* **Backup Option:** If Bob rejects the offer, you can always sell to John for your minimum price of $100."
