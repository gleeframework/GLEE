"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $140. I believe it will be highly valuable to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is $140.** This is less than your maximum budget of $150.
* **Buying from John would cost $150.** This is more expensive than Alice's offer.

Therefore, accepting Alice's offer is the best option as it saves you $10 compared to buying from John."
