Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value and the interest I've had, I'm setting the price at $14,500. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 14500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we know John will buy the product for $15,000, there's a chance to get more from Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:**  Offering the product slightly below John's price ($14,500) creates a sense of urgency and value for Bob. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  While the offer is close to your minimum, there's a slight buffer if Bob wants to negotiate a little.

This strategy aims to secure the best possible price while considering Bob's valuation and the guaranteed offer from John."
