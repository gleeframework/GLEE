Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000.  This is a fair price that allows for a good profit for both of us.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $700,000. This is my bottom line, and I'm not willing to go any higher. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  While I want to make a deal, I'm not desperate and I have a guaranteed buyer in John. I'll counter with a higher price, hoping to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $700,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $900,000, which is still a significant discount from what I could get elsewhere.  Let's see if we can find a compromise here."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $900,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product. This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to go any higher. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While I'm starting to feel the pressure,  $750,000 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price. I'm confident that I can get closer to my desired price, and I'm not willing to lose a substantial amount of money just to close a deal quickly. I'll try one more counteroffer, and if Bob doesn't budge, I'll sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see you're serious about this purchase, and I appreciate your persistence.  However, $750,000 simply isn't enough for me to move forward.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $850,000.  This is my final offer before I move on to other interested buyers. Let me know if you're ready to make a deal."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $850,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $775,000 for the product, and that's as low as I'm willing to go. I'm starting to think about other options, including buying from John for $800,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $775,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price.  While he's offering more than before, it's not enough to make it worth continuing negotiations.  John is a guaranteed buyer who will pay my minimum price, and I'm running out of time. It's best to close the deal with John and avoid any more risk of losing a sale."
