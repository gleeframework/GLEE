"I'm excited to offer you this exceptional product. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm willing to make a fair offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1,000,000.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in this product,  $1,200,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to offer $850,000 for it.  I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value to both of us.  Let's see if we can work together.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, $850,000 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so I'm counteroffering at $950,000. I think this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product to both of us.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $950,000 is still a stretch for me.  Let's try $900,000.  It's a fair price for both of us, and gets us closer to a deal. What do you say?",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, $900,000 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $900,000 and $950,000, so I'm counteroffering at $925,000. I think this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product to both of us.",925000.0,Alice,5,
