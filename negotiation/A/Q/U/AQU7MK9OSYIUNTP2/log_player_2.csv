"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this exceptional product. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm willing to make a fair offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1,000,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is way above my budget.  I need to negotiate to get the price down closer to my $800,000 limit.  Rejecting the offer allows me to start the counter-offer process."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in this product,  $1,200,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to offer $850,000 for it.  I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value to both of us.  Let's see if we can work together."", ""product_price"": 850000} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, $850,000 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so I'm counteroffering at $950,000. I think this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product to both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $950,000 is closer to my budget, but still higher than what I'm comfortable with.  I'm going to continue negotiating to see if I can get the price even lower.  Rejecting the offer gives me the opportunity to make another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your perspective, but $950,000 is still a stretch for me.  Let's try $900,000.  It's a fair price for both of us, and gets us closer to a deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 900000} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, $900,000 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $900,000 and $950,000, so I'm counteroffering at $925,000. I think this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product to both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $925,000 is still more than I wanted to pay, it's getting close to my limit. I've had a few rounds of negotiation, and it's unlikely Alice will go much lower.  Accepting this offer ensures I get the product and doesn't risk further negotiation potentially going over my budget.  It's a win for me as I've managed to get a price significantly lower than Alice's initial asking price."
