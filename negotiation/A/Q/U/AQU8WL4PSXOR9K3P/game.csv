"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you see in the product, but my budget is quite limited. I am willing to pay up to $750000 for the product. I hope we can come to an agreement that works for both of us.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $750000 is your top limit, but I'm still willing to negotiate. Considering the value this product can bring to your business, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $825000. This is a fair price, considering the product's worth to me is $800000, but I'm willing to compromise to reach an agreement.",825000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still not able to meet you at $825000. I think we might need to adjust our expectations slightly. I would like to propose a price of $800000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price given its value to me, and I hope it will also work for you.",800000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a sweet spot, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I've already compromised significantly by offering $825000. I'm willing to make one more adjustment, but I need to protect my interests. I'm counteroffering at $815000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to me is $800000. If we can meet at this price, I'm willing to finalize the deal.",815000.0,Alice,5,
