"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer, aiming for a good starting point.  I want to see if Bob is serious about buying and how close he's willing to get to my ideal price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $1,200,000 is a good price, I'm hoping to get closer to my ideal price of $1,400,000.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000} 
```

I'm lowering my price slightly, showing a willingness to negotiate, but still keeping it above Bob's offer.  I'm hoping this will encourage Bob to come closer to my desired price."

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm still hoping to get closer to my target price. I'm rejecting Bob's offer for now, but I'm starting to get nervous about running out of rounds.  I'll counteroffer in the next round, but I might need to consider selling to John if I don't see a significant increase in Bob's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000} 
```

I'm lowering my price again, but I'm getting closer to the minimum I'm willing to accept. We're getting near the end of the negotiation, and I need to make a decision. If Bob rejects this offer, I'll need to consider selling to John."

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While we're getting close to the end, I'm still holding out for a higher price. I'm willing to risk another round, but if Bob doesn't come up in the next round, I'll likely sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1175000} 
```

This is my final offer. It's close to Bob's last offer, but still above my minimum. If he rejects it, I'll sell to John."

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

We're down to the wire, and I'm not confident Bob will come up to my price. It's better to take the guaranteed $1,000,000 from John than risk getting nothing from Bob."
