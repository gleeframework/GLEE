"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly lower than my value and still leaves you with a good profit margin. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above your maximum budget of $800,000. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price before going to John."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 just doesn't work for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This gives us both a good deal, and ensures we can both walk away satisfied. Let me know what you think.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above your maximum budget of $800,000. It's worth trying to negotiate further to see if you can get closer to your target price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $950,000 still leaves me too far from my desired price. I'm willing to come down to $975,000. This is a fair compromise, and we can both walk away happy with this deal. Let's make it happen.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $975,000 is still above your maximum budget of $800,000.  You've already negotiated for a while and it's unlikely you'll get Alice to budge any further. At this point, it's more beneficial to buy from John for a guaranteed price within your budget."
