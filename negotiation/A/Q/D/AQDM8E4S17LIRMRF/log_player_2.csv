Alice's offer:

Alice's offer:

**Reasoning:**  While Alice is coming down on her price, she's unlikely to reach a price that's significantly better than John's $8,000 offer. Continuing to negotiate with Alice has a risk of her not budging much further, and Bob would ultimately end up paying more than he needs to."
