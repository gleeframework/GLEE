"I'm interested in the product, but I think $1500000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $800000 for it. Can you consider this offer?",800000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, I'm afraid $800000 is a bit low considering its value. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1200000. This is the lowest I can go, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair price. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, but I still think $1200000 is a bit high. I'm willing to pay $1000000 for the product. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping you can meet me at this price.",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $1200000. However, I'm willing to sweeten the deal by throwing in some additional perks and support to sweeten the deal. I'm thinking of including a comprehensive warranty and dedicated customer support for a year. Would you be willing to meet me at $1100000 for the product, considering the added value?",1100000.0,Alice,5,
