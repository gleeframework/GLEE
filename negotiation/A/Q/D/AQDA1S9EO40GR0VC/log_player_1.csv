Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, making this your absolute floor.
* **Bob's Value:** Bob values the product at $1,200,000. He won't pay more than this.
* **Negotiation Space:** There's a potential negotiation space between $1,200,000 and $1,500,000.

**Strategy**

The key is to propose a price that's appealing to Bob while still maximizing your profit.  Here's a balanced approach:

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exclusive opportunity to acquire the product.  Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000.  I believe this represents a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```

**Explanation**

* **Message Tone:** The message is framed positively, emphasizing the product's value and the ""exclusive"" nature of the offer.
* **Price Point:**  $1,350,000 splits the difference between your minimum and Bob's maximum, leaving room for potential counter-offers. 

**Important Considerations**

* **Bob's Personality:** If you know Bob is a tough negotiator, you might start slightly higher (e.g., $1,390,000) to leave more room for negotiation.
* **Time Sensitivity:** If you need to sell quickly, a lower price might be more attractive.
* **Relationship:** If maintaining a good relationship with Bob is important, a fairer price can go a long way.

**Remember:** This is just an initial offer. Be prepared for Bob to counter-offer, and you can then negotiate further to reach a mutually agreeable price."
