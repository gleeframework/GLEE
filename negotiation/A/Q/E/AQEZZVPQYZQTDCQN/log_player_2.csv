"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $140. I believe you'll find great value in it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's Offer:** $140
* **Your Maximum Price:** $150
* **John's Price:** $150

Accepting Alice's offer saves you $10 compared to buying from John. While you could try to negotiate further with Alice, there's no guarantee of a better price and you risk losing the deal altogether."
