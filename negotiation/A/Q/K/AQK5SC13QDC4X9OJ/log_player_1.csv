"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000.  It's a fantastic deal considering its value to you.  Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price that's slightly above Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm using a friendly and encouraging tone to build rapport.
* **Focus on Value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the value the product holds for him, making the offer more appealing.

**Strategy:**

I want to start with a strong offer but not be overly aggressive. This approach gives me room to negotiate downward if needed, while still maximizing my potential earnings. If Bob rejects this offer, I will then assess his counteroffer and proceed accordingly. I'm always mindful of the backup option of selling to John for $1,500,000, which provides a safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  Bob's offer is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Negotiation Potential:**  While Bob is willing to pay a premium, his offer is too far off my desired price. There's still room for negotiation to reach a mutually agreeable price. 

**Strategy:**

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my desired range. I'll aim for a price that's still within Bob's budget but closer to my minimum acceptable price. By continuing negotiations, I'm hoping to find a solution that works for both of us."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me.  However, I'm willing to be flexible.  How about we split the difference and I offer you the product for $1,300,000?  This price is still within your stated budget, and it's a fair compromise for both of us.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a compromise by splitting the difference between my previous offer and Bob's offer. This demonstrates a willingness to negotiate while still maintaining a price that's closer to my minimum.
* **Reiterate Budget:**  I'm subtly reminding Bob that my offer is within his budget, making it more appealing.
* **Fairness:** I'm emphasizing the fairness of the compromise, suggesting a win-win situation for both parties.

**Strategy:**

I'm taking a more moderate approach by offering a price that's closer to the middle ground. This strategy aims to keep the negotiations moving forward while ensuring that I don't give away too much. If Bob rejects this counteroffer, I'll reassess his counteroffer and adjust my approach accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to be flexible, but I'm still a bit short on budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $1,250,000? I'm willing to pay a bit more, but I need to stay within my budget constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too Low:** While Bob's offer is higher than his previous one, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Negotiation is Essential:** There's still room for negotiation. I'm not ready to settle for a price that significantly undervalues the product.

**Strategy:**

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and make another counteroffer. I'll try to bridge the gap further by proposing a price slightly higher than Bob's offer, but still below my minimum. I'm mindful that time is running out, so I'll need to be firm but also willing to compromise to reach a deal."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your efforts to meet me halfway, but $1,250,000 is still a bit too low for me. Let's bridge the gap further.  I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This price is a good compromise, and it's still within your budget, considering you're willing to pay a premium.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bridging the Gap:**  I'm offering a price slightly higher than Bob's last offer but still significantly lower than my initial offer. This demonstrates flexibility and a willingness to compromise.
* **Highlighting Budget:** I'm reminding Bob that my counteroffer is still within his stated budget range, making it more appealing.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm maintaining a friendly and optimistic tone to keep the negotiation positive.

**Strategy:**

I'm aiming to find a middle ground that's both acceptable to Bob and profitable for me. By offering a price closer to his last offer, I'm hoping to encourage him to accept. I'm still mindful of my minimum acceptable price, and if Bob rejects this offer, I'll need to reassess the situation and decide if I'm willing to continue negotiating or sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're willing to come down, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,250,000 and $1,350,000. Would you be willing to sell the product to me for $1,300,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** Bob's offer of $1,300,000 is close to my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Time is Running Out:**  We're approaching the halfway point of the negotiations, and I need to weigh the potential of further negotiation against the risk of losing time and potentially missing out on a sale to John.
* **Compromise:** Accepting Bob's offer represents a compromise that's in my best interest, considering the limited time and potential for further negotiation.

**Strategy:**

While I'm still hoping to achieve a higher price, accepting Bob's offer is a safe and practical choice.  It ensures a sale within a reasonable timeframe and prevents the risk of further negotiation without a guarantee of a better outcome."
