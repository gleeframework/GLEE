"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the product at a special price of $9,000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you'll love the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's offer of $9,000 is above Bob's maximum budget of $8,000. Therefore, it's in Bob's best interest to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the special price, my budget for this product is $8,000. Would you be willing to consider that?"", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, I'm not quite willing to meet your budget of $8,000. I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $8,500. I think you'll find it's a fair price considering the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's counteroffer of $8,500 is still higher than Bob's maximum budget of $8,000. While it's closer, Bob can still potentially save money by continuing to negotiate.  He can try to get closer to his target price of $8,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm still very interested in the product, but $8,500 is still a bit above my budget.  Would you be willing to come down to $8,250? It's a fair compromise, and I'm sure we can finalize the deal."", ""product_price"": 8250}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad you're still interested in the product, Bob. I can see you're willing to make a compromise, and I appreciate that. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $8,250. I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $8,800. I think it's a fair price considering the product's value and the negotiations we've had so far. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's counteroffer of $8,800 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $8,000.  While they are getting closer, it's clear that Alice is unwilling to drop down to Bob's target price.  At this point, Bob has two options: 

* **Continue negotiating:**  He could continue to counteroffer, but there's no guarantee that Alice will budge further, and he risks wasting time.
* **Buy from John:** John is offering the product for Bob's exact budget, so there's no risk of going over budget and no need for further negotiation.

Therefore, it's more efficient and cost-effective for Bob to buy the product from John for $8,000."
