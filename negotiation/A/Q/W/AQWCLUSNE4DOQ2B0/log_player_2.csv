"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to present our premium product to you. It's a unique opportunity tailored to meet your specific needs and expectations. Given its value to you, I propose a price of $12,000. This offer is designed to ensure mutual benefit while maximizing the value I receive for this exceptional item. I believe it strikes a fair balance between the product's worth and your budget. Please let me know if you have any questions or need further information. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $12,000 is less than her product's value to her, you know you can get a better deal from John. You're willing to pay a maximum of $10,000, and John is offering the product at that price.  Rejecting Alice's offer allows you to pursue this more favorable option."
