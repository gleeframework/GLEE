``` 

This is a good time to accept Alice's offer. Here's why:

* **Alice is at her limit:** She explicitly stated that $10,000 is the lowest she'll go. 
* **You've reached a good price:**  You're getting the product for $2,000 less than John's offer and $1,000 less than Alice's initial offer.

Continuing to negotiate might risk the deal, and you've already secured a significant discount."
