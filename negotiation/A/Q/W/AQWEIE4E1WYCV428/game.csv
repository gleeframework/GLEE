"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. I'm willing to pay that price, but I need to make sure it's a good deal for both of us. Can you consider my offer?",9000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'd like to make a new offer of $9500. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value, and I'm willing to make a serious commitment to buy it from you if we can agree on this price.",9500.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to make a serious commitment to buy the product. However, I'm still not willing to sell it to you for $9500.

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to make a serious commitment to buy the product. However, I'm still not willing to sell it to you for $9200.

"I appreciate your willingness to make another adjustment, Alice, but I'm still not convinced that $10500 is the right price. I'd like to make a new offer of $9500 again, but this time I'm willing to throw in a small concession: I'll also agree to pay a small service fee of $200 to cover any additional costs. So, the total price would be $9700. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and the additional service fee.",9700.0,Bob,8,
