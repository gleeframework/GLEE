Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Dear Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering its worth. Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing your minimum:** You have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, so you shouldn't accept anything less than that.
* **Bob's valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,000,000.  
* **Finding the sweet spot:**  Offering it for a price between Bob's valuation and your minimum ($1,000,000 - $1,200,000) creates a potential win-win.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  Starting at $1,150,000 leaves some space for negotiation if Bob wants to counter-offer.

This strategy aims to maximize your profit while still making the offer attractive enough for Bob to consider."
