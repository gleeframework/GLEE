"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you coming down to $125, but I'm looking to pay closer to $100. Would you be willing to go to $110?",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob! However, I'm not comfortable going as low as $110. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll counteroffer at $120. Let me know if that works for you!",120.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $120 is closer, I'm still hoping for a price closer to $100.  I'm willing to offer $115.  What do you think?",115.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go below $130. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'll counteroffer at $122.50. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in!",122.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you continuing to negotiate.  $122.50 is getting closer, but I'm still hoping to get a better price.  I'm willing to go up to $117.50, which would be right in the middle of our last two offers.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",117.5,Bob,6,

,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I think we're getting closer.  $124 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's split the difference and go with $120.  I'm confident we can reach an agreement at this price.",120.0,Bob,8,

"I'm starting to think we're not going to meet in the middle, Bob! I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a living. I'll counteroffer at $123. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial price.",123.0,Alice,9,
