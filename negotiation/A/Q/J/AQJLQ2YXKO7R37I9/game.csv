"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but $175 is a little steep for me. Would you consider $110?",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $110 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about $140? This is a fair price considering the value of the product.",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand, $110 was probably too low.  How about we meet in the middle at $125?",125.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm willing to negotiate further, but $125 is still below my minimum.  How about we split the difference and go with $137.50? This would be a fair compromise for both of us.",137.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you working with me on the price, Alice.  How about $130, and we have a deal?",130.0,Bob,6,
