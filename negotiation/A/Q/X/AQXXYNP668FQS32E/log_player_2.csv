{""message"": ""I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, $1,400,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?"", ""product_price"": 1100000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1,100,000 is simply too far below my minimum.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair deal. How about $1,250,000? This would still allow you to make a significant profit, and it's a reasonable starting point for further negotiations.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll try to make a more aggressive counteroffer, but still keep it within my budget.

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,250,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer of $1,100,000, so I'm willing to go up to $1,150,000. That's the maximum I'm willing to pay. Can you consider this offer?"", ""product_price"": 1150000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product.  However, $1,150,000 is still too far below what I need to make this worthwhile.  I'm willing to compromise, but I can't go lower than $1,200,000.  This is my minimum price, and I believe it's fair considering the value of the product to you.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll try to make a final, aggressive counteroffer that's as close as possible to my maximum budget.

{""message"": ""Alice, I understand that you're trying to make a profit, but $1,200,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,150,000, but that's as high as I can go. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options. Can you reconsider?"", ""product_price"": 1150000}"
