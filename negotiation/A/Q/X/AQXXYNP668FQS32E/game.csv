"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. I'm sure it will be a great asset to your business. My initial price is $1,400,000. Let's see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, $1,400,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,100,000 is simply too far below my minimum.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair deal. How about $1,250,000? This would still allow you to make a significant profit, and it's a reasonable starting point for further negotiations.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,250,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer of $1,100,000, so I'm willing to go up to $1,150,000. That's the maximum I'm willing to pay. Can you consider this offer?",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product.  However, $1,150,000 is still too far below what I need to make this worthwhile.  I'm willing to compromise, but I can't go lower than $1,200,000.  This is my minimum price, and I believe it's fair considering the value of the product to you.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement at this price.",1200000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand that you're trying to make a profit, but $1,200,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,150,000, but that's as high as I can go. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options. Can you reconsider?",1150000.0,Bob,6,
