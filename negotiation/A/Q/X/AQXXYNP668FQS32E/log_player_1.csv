"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, $1,400,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $1,100,000 is too low for me, considering my minimum price is $1,200,000.  I'll try to get closer to my target price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,100,000 is simply too far below my minimum.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair deal. How about $1,250,000? This would still allow you to make a significant profit, and it's a reasonable starting point for further negotiations."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,250,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer of $1,100,000, so I'm willing to go up to $1,150,000. That's the maximum I'm willing to pay. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $1,150,000 is tempting, it's still below my minimum price.  I'm going to reject this offer and see if I can get closer to my target with another counteroffer.  I have a few rounds left, so I'm not in a rush to accept anything that doesn't meet my minimum requirements."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product.  However, $1,150,000 is still too far below what I need to make this worthwhile.  I'm willing to compromise, but I can't go lower than $1,200,000.  This is my minimum price, and I believe it's fair considering the value of the product to you.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement at this price."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand that you're trying to make a profit, but $1,200,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,150,000, but that's as high as I can go. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options. Can you reconsider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is not budging from $1,150,000. I've made it clear that my minimum is $1,200,000, and he's not willing to meet me there.  With only a few rounds left, I don't want to risk losing the deal altogether.  I'm going to sell to John for $1,200,000 to ensure I get my desired price."
