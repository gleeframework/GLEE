"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I really like the product, but I'm on a tight budget. Can you meet me at this price?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're on a tight budget, but $900,000 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference?  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000.  This is a great deal for both of us, and I believe it's a price we can both agree on.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,000,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $950,000. Can you consider this price?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate.  However, $950,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway *again* -  how about $975,000?  This is a fair price, and I'm confident it's a deal we can both be happy with.",975000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway again, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I can do $960,000, but that's as low as I can go. Can you consider this price?",960000.0,Bob,6,
