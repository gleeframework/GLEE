Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you might be interested in. I'm offering it to you for $149. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 149}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $150, you want to see if Bob will pay more. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with a price slightly below your guaranteed amount allows for the possibility of Bob negotiating up, getting you even closer to your maximum potential profit. 
* **High but Potentially Appealing:** While $149 is significantly more than Bob's perceived value ($80), it's possible there are other factors influencing his decision (urgency, lack of alternatives) that might make him willing to pay a premium. 

This strategy aims to get the best possible price from Bob while still ensuring you don't lose out on a guaranteed sale to John."
