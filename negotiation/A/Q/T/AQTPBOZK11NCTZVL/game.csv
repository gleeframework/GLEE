"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand the value of your product is significant to you, but I believe we can find a price closer to what I'm willing to pay. How about we aim for $750,000? This would allow us to both benefit from the transaction.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $750,000 is unfortunately too low for me. Given the value of this product, I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet in the middle at $800,000?  This price would ensure a fair deal for both of us. Let's work towards a mutually beneficial agreement.",800000.0,Alice,3,
