Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $15,000. I believe it offers significant value, and this price reflects its worth in the market."", 
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally wise to start negotiations with a price higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a better deal.
* **Gauging Interest:** Bob's response to this initial offer will be telling. If he accepts immediately, you know you could have potentially gone higher. If he rejects it, you can negotiate down towards your minimum while still aiming for a profit. 
* **Alternative Buyer:** You have a safety net in John, who is willing to pay your minimum acceptable price. This gives you leverage in negotiations with Bob."
