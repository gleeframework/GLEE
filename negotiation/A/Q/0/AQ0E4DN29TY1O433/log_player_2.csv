"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase my product. It's a unique item with a value I know you'll appreciate. My asking price is $850,000.  This is a fair price considering the product's worth. If you're interested, let's discuss further.  However, I have a backup buyer who is willing to pay my minimum asking price of $800,000, so I'm confident I'll find a buyer either way. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
