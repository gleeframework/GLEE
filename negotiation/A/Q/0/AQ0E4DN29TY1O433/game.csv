"Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase my product. It's a unique item with a value I know you'll appreciate. My asking price is $850,000.  This is a fair price considering the product's worth. If you're interested, let's discuss further.  However, I have a backup buyer who is willing to pay my minimum asking price of $800,000, so I'm confident I'll find a buyer either way.",850000.0,Alice,1,
