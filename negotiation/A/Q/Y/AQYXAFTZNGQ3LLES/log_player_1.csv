Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe you'll find valuable. I'm willing to offer it to you for $120. Let me know if you're interested!"",
""product_price"": 120
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations a bit higher than Bob's perceived value ($80) and significantly lower than John's guaranteed offer ($150). This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Appearing Reasonable:** Offering a price of $120 makes it seem like you're giving Bob a good deal while still aiming for a significant profit. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** If Bob counters, you can potentially still go down a bit and make a sale above your minimum."
