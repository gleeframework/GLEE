Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $11,500. I believe it will be very valuable for you, and this is a competitive price. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11500} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Alice wants to get as close to $12,000 as possible, but still offer an enticing deal to Bob.
* **Create Urgency:** The ""limited time"" phrase adds a bit of pressure for Bob to act quickly.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  While the initial offer is high, it allows some wiggle room if Bob tries to negotiate down.
