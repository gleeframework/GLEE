"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $11,500. I believe it holds significant value, and this offer reflects a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You should reject Alice's offer. Here's why:

* **You can get a better price:** You know John will sell you the product for $12,000. While Alice's offer of $11,500 is tempting, there's a chance you can get her to come down further. 
* **Negotiating power:** By rejecting her first offer, you signal to Alice that you're looking for a better deal.  

Let's see if Alice is willing to lower her price further."
