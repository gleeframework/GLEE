Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $11,500. I believe it holds significant value, and this offer reflects a fair price for both of us."", 
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  My goal is to get as close to Bob's $12,000 valuation as possible, maximizing my profit.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $11,500 leaves some room for potential negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. 
* **Above My Minimum:**  This price is significantly above my minimum of $10,000, ensuring a good profit even if Bob negotiates down slightly. 

By starting with a strong but not overly aggressive offer, I increase the chances of Bob accepting and me securing a higher profit."
