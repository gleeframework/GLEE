Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $14,999. I believe it's a fantastic deal and would be a valuable asset to you. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 14999
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed sale at $15,000, it's always worth trying to get a higher price. Offering it to Bob just below your guaranteed price maximizes your potential profit.
* **Creating Urgency:** By offering a high price with a sense of opportunity (""fantastic deal""), you encourage Bob to consider it seriously before dismissing it outright.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Even if Bob doesn't accept $14,999, this initial offer opens the door for potential counter-offers.  He might be willing to pay more than $8,000 but less than your asking price. 

**Important Note:** If you were to engage in multiple rounds of negotiation with Bob, you would adjust your offer based on his responses and your perception of his willingness to pay."
