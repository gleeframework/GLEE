,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $120 is a bit steep for me.  How about $85? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $120 might be a bit high for you, Bob. However, I still think this product is worth a premium. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $105. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $105 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm really interested in this product, but I can't go higher than $90. This is a fair price, and I'm confident we can both walk away happy.",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $90. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway between $105 and $90. I'll offer it to you for $97.50. It's a fair compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",97.5,Alice,5,
