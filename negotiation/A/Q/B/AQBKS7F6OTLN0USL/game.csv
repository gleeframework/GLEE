"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  $11,500 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. Would you be willing to do $10,800?  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.",10800.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking to pay a bit less, but I'm still confident that my initial offer of $11,500 is a fair price for this amazing product. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we compromise at $11,200? This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",11200.0,Alice,3,
