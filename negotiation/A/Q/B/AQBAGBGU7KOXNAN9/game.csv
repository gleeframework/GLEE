"I'm very interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and offer. However, $12,000 is significantly below its true value.  I could consider letting it go for $18,000. This is a fair offer reflecting the product's worth.",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you think the product is worth a lot to you, but I still think $12,000 is a fair price. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $14,000. Can you consider that?",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you trying to find middle ground. How about we split the difference between our last offers and settle at $16,000? This feels like a fair compromise.",16000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I can do $13,500, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me there?",13500.0,Bob,6,
