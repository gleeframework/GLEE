Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, and I think it's a price we can both be happy with. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:** I'm offering a price slightly lower than my minimum acceptable price ($15,000) but still significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($12,000). This creates space for negotiation and gives Bob a sense that he can get a good deal.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** This initial offer gives me room to potentially compromise if Bob makes a counteroffer, while still giving me a good profit margin.
* **Maintaining Flexibility:** By leaving the possibility of selling to John for $15,000, I keep the negotiation dynamic and prevent myself from being locked into a deal that isn't favorable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate it. However, given my budget constraints, I am only willing to pay up to $12,000 for the product. Would you be able to accommodate this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  Bob's offer of $12,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. Accepting this offer would result in a significant loss for me.
* **Negotiation Potential:** While Bob's offer is unacceptable, it does indicate a willingness to negotiate. This opens the door for me to make a counteroffer that is more favorable to me.
* **Maintaining Leverage:**  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to maintain my bargaining position and potentially achieve a better price. Selling to John is always an option, but I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, $12,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need at least $13,500 to make this work.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  I've moved closer to Bob's offer, but still maintaining a profit margin.  This demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while also ensuring I don't go below my minimum acceptable price.
* **High Value Justification:** I'm emphasizing the value of the product to reiterate why my price is justified.
* **Continuing the Negotiation:**  I'm not accepting his offer yet, but showing a willingness to compromise. This keeps the negotiation going and gives Bob a chance to consider my revised offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. Given my current financial situation, I am unable to meet your $13,500 asking price. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $12,500. This is the highest amount I can realistically afford while still staying within my budget. I hope this meets your needs. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to the Line:** Bob's offer of $12,500 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000, and only $500 higher than his initial offer. 
* **Limited Upward Potential:** There's limited room for Bob to increase his offer further. It's likely he's reached his maximum budget. 
* **Guaranteed Profit:** Selling to John for $15,000 guarantees me a better deal than accepting Bob's current offer. The potential for further negotiations with Bob is minimal, and the risk of getting a lower price is high. 

**Conclusion:**  To maximize my profit and avoid further negotiations, selling to John at this point is the best decision."
