"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to own something truly unique. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1200000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you, and I'm confident you'll be thrilled with your decision to purchase it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is lower than her own valuation, it's still above Bob's maximum budget. It's worth negotiating further to see if a better deal can be reached."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. It's definitely a good starting point, but I'm looking to stay within my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product. It's a fair price, and I'm confident we can both benefit from this transaction."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still looking to get a fair price for the product. Considering its value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering it to you for $1100000. I think this is a reasonable compromise that benefits both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price to $1,100,000, which is still higher than Bob's maximum budget of $1,000,000.  While there's a chance Bob could negotiate further, there's no guarantee Alice will accept a lower offer. Given that John is willing to sell the product for Bob's maximum budget, it's a safer and more financially beneficial option to buy from John."
