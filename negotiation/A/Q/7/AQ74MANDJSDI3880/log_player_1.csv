Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to buy this product for $130. I believe it's highly valuable and would be a great purchase for you."", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $150, so there's room to negotiate above your minimum price ($80) and still provide him with value.
* **Maximizing Profit:** Starting with a higher offer ($130) allows room for negotiation. If Bob counter-offers, you can gradually decrease the price, aiming to secure a deal closer to his maximum valuation. 
* **Alternative Buyer:**  Knowing you have a guaranteed sale at $80 with John gives you leverage. You don't have to settle for anything below that price.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing profit and ensuring a successful sale."
