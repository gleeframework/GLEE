{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $20,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 20000}
``` 

This is a starting point.  Here's why I chose this price and how I'll adapt:

* **Starting High:**  A higher initial price gives me more room to negotiate downwards.
* **Room for Compromise:** $20,000 is above my minimum, allowing for potential concessions if Bob counter-offers.
* **Positive Framing:**  The message emphasizes the value of the product and positions the price as a good deal.

**How I'll Adapt Based on Bob's Response:**

* **If Bob Accepts:**  Excellent! I've maximized my profit.
* **If Bob Counter-Offers:**
    * **Low Offer:** I might counter-offer slightly lower, but I'll be careful not to drop below my minimum value too quickly.
    * **Reasonable Offer:** I might accept if it's close to my target price.
    * **Too High:**  I'll either counter with a firm price closer to my minimum or politely decline.

**Remember:**  The key is to be confident, but also willing to compromise to reach a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $15000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is my minimum:**  While I'm happy to sell for $15,000, I want to see if I can squeeze out a slightly better price.
* **Potential for Compromise:**  Bob has shown a willingness to negotiate.  There's a chance I can get him to meet me halfway.
* **Avoiding a ""Sell to John"" decision yet:** It's too early to give up on a better deal.  I'll make a counter-offer to see if Bob will budge."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer.  I understand your budget constraints.  I'm willing to come down to $17,500. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it a great value.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 17500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm meeting Bob halfway between his offer and my initial price. This shows flexibility.
* **Positive Framing:**  I emphasize ""fair compromise"" and ""great value"" to make the offer more appealing.
* **Room for Negotiation:**  $17,500 is still above my minimum, allowing for a potential final counteroffer from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $17500. Would you be willing to meet me at $16000? I'm really interested in the product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** $16,000 is only $1,000 below my target price of $17,500.  
* **Strong Interest:**  Bob has shown a genuine interest in the product, and is willing to negotiate. 
* **Risk of losing a deal:**  If I reject his offer, there's a chance he'll walk away, and I'll have to settle for John's offer of $15,000.

While I'd prefer $17,500,  it's not worth the risk of losing a deal entirely.  Accepting Bob's offer is the most practical choice at this point."
