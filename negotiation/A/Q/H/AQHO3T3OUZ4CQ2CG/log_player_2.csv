"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a fantastic opportunity for you, and I'm confident it'll be a profitable investment. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but  $1,400,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $1,100,000?"", ""product_price"": 1100000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  I'm starting with an offer significantly lower than Alice's asking price. This leaves room for negotiation and signals that I'm looking for a good deal.
* **Aiming Below My Limit:** My goal is to get the product for as close to Alice's value ($1,200,000) as possible while staying well below my own limit.
* **Leaving Room to Negotiate:** I expect Alice to counter, and I'm prepared to gradually increase my offer over subsequent rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1,100,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000, which is still a great deal for you considering the value of the product.  Let's try to find a compromise that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice Moved Considerably:** Her counteroffer of $1,300,000 shows she's willing to negotiate, which is a good sign.
* **Room for Negotiation:**  There's still a significant gap between her offer and both my initial counteroffer and her product's value.
* **Time Advantage:** We have plenty of rounds left. I'll continue to nudge the price down gradually."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me. I'm getting closer to a price point where I'm comfortable. How about $1,175,000?"", ""product_price"": 1175000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Gradual Increase:** I'm increasing my offer, but in a measured way to signal my seriousness while still aiming for a lower price.
* **Midpoint:** This counteroffer sits roughly in the middle of the current negotiating range ($1,100,000 - $1,300,000).
* **Testing the Waters:**  This offer will help gauge how much further Alice is willing to go."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm willing to be flexible, but $1,175,000 just isn't enough for me. I'm coming down to $1,250,000. This is a good price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll make a strong return on your investment. Let's close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Positive Movement:** Alice is clearly willing to negotiate, moving closer to her product's value.
* **Within Reach:** A price below $1,200,000 seems attainable with a few more rounds.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** The potential savings outweigh the risk of Alice walking away at this stage.  I'm willing to push a bit further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, you're getting close! I'm willing to make this work. How about $1,210,000? That's a fair offer considering the current market."", ""product_price"": 1210000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** I'm making a more substantial jump in my offer to signal that I'm serious about closing the deal.
* **Above Her Value:** Offering slightly above Alice's $1,200,000 valuation sweetens the deal and makes it hard to refuse.
* **Justified Price:**  Mentioning the ""current market"" adds a layer of justification, even if it's a general statement.
* **Time Pressure:** We're past the halfway point, so putting a slightly stronger offer on the table makes sense."
