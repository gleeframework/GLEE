"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the value I'll be getting from the product.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me to consider.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but how about $1,300,000? This still leaves some room for negotiation, but it's a more reasonable starting point for us.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1,300,000, but I'm still a bit higher than that. How about we meet in the middle at $1,350,000? I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'm not willing to go above that amount.",1350000.0,Bob,4,
