"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you might be interested in. I believe it's worth $100 to you, and while I'd like to get a good price for it, I'm willing to start the negotiations at $90. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 90}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. Would you be willing to meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** Bob is already trying to get the product for the absolute minimum price. It's unlikely he'll go much higher, and we risk getting stuck in a long negotiation for a small potential gain. Accepting John's offer guarantees us our minimum acceptable price immediately."
