"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $10,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $6,500?",6500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I'm afraid $6,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $9,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you is $8,000. Let me know if you're interested!",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello again Alice. I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $9,000 is still a bit more than I'd like to spend. How about $7,500?",7500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $8,500. I'm still willing to negotiate, but I need to make sure I get a fair price for the product. Would you be willing to meet me at $8,500?",8500.0,Alice,5,
