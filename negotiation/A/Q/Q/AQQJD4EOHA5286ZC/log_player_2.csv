Alice's offer is way too high.  It's more than my maximum budget, so I will reject her offer and try to negotiate a lower price."

I'm offering Alice my maximum price for the product. This is also the price I can get it from John, so if she rejects this offer, I'll just go with John."

Alice's offer is still too high.  I'm willing to pay up to $120, and I can get it from John for that price.  I'll reject her offer and try to negotiate a lower price again."

I'm willing to go slightly higher than my initial offer, but not much. This is still below Alice's offer and I'm hoping she'll accept it to avoid losing the sale."
