"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item at a competitive price. My initial offer is $9,500. Is this something you'd be interested in?",9500.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of this product,  $9,500 is a bit more than I can afford right now. I'd be happy to purchase it for $8,000, which is the maximum I'm able to spend. Let me know if you're open to that price.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. My revised offer is $9,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and the market demand. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. While I'm willing to meet you halfway, $9,000 is still a bit too high.  How about $8,500? This is a fair compromise considering the product's value and my budget. What do you think?",8500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $8,500 is still a bit above your budget, but I'm not willing to go below $9,000. I'm willing to make another compromise, though. My revised offer is $9,250. This is as close to your offer as I'm willing to go. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",9250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9,250 is still beyond my budget. I'm ready to make a final offer of $8,750. I believe this represents a fair compromise considering your desired price and my limitations. I'm confident this is a win-win situation for both of us.  Let me know what you think.",8750.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm starting to feel like we're getting close to the point where it's more beneficial for me to explore other options. I'm willing to meet you at $9,000, but I'm not going any lower than that. This is my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other buyers.",9000.0,Alice,7,
