Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 200}
```

I'm starting with a price of $200, which is higher than my minimum value but leaves room for negotiation. This allows me to gauge Bob's interest and potentially secure a higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
 
While Bob's offer is the minimum I'm willing to accept, I'm going to try to get a better price. I will make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}
```

I'm offering a price of $175. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. I'm hoping that this price is attractive enough to Bob, but still allows me to earn more than my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $160
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $160 is higher than what John is offering, and it's close enough to my desired price.  I'll accept his offer and close the deal."
