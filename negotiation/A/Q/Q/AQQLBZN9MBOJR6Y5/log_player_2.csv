Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I'm interested in this product, $2,000,000 is above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,200,000.  This is a fair price considering the value I see in this product."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. I understand that $1200000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $1600000.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is still above my budget.  Even though she's met me halfway, it's worth pushing for a lower price.  I'll counteroffer again and see if we can reach an agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,600,000 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm willing to go to $1,400,000, which is a significant investment for me.  Let's see if we can find common ground here."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm counteroffering at $1550000, which is the lowest I'm willing to go. Let's see if we can meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,550,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,550,000 is still slightly higher than my maximum budget of $1,500,000.  It's getting close, but I'm not comfortable risking going over my budget.  Since I have a guaranteed option from John, I'll take that deal and avoid the potential for further negotiation."
