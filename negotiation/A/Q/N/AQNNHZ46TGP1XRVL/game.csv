"Hi Alice, thanks for offering this product. While I agree it's a great fit, $22,000 is a bit outside my budget.  I'd be willing to pay $10,000 for it.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is significantly less than what I'm looking for.  How about we meet in the middle at $18,000? I'm confident you'll find it's a fair price for the value this product provides.",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand you're looking for a higher price, but $18,000 is still more than I'm comfortable spending.  Would you consider $12,000? That's a significant jump from my previous offer.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the counter-offer. I'm motivated to sell but need to get closer to my target price. Would you be willing to consider $15,500?  This offer reflects the true value of the product.",15500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  However, $15,500 is still a bit too high for me.  My absolute maximum is $13,000.  If that's not workable, I understand, but I hope we can make a deal.",13000.0,Bob,6,
