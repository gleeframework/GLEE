Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for offering this product. While I agree it's a great fit, $22,000 is a bit outside my budget.  I'd be willing to pay $10,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is significantly less than what I'm looking for.  How about we meet in the middle at $18,000? I'm confident you'll find it's a fair price for the value this product provides."", ""product_price"": 18000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand you're looking for a higher price, but $18,000 is still more than I'm comfortable spending.  Would you consider $12,000? That's a significant jump from my previous offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the counter-offer. I'm motivated to sell but need to get closer to my target price. Would you be willing to consider $15,500?  This offer reflects the true value of the product."", ""product_price"": 15500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  However, $15,500 is still a bit too high for me.  My absolute maximum is $13,000.  If that's not workable, I understand, but I hope we can make a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

Explanation: Bob has consistently shown he is unwilling to meet a price point that is acceptable. While he is inching upwards, it's unlikely further negotiation will bridge the gap quickly enough, and it's better to take the guaranteed $15,000 from John."
