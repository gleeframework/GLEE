Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that could be incredibly valuable to your business. I can't reveal the details just yet, but I assure you it's worth at least $1,000,000 to me. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,250,000. This is a limited-time offer, so please let me know your decision as soon as possible."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Message:**  I've tried to be enticing without revealing too much. I highlight the potential value to Bob and emphasize the limited-time offer to create urgency.
* **Price:** I've set the price at $1,250,000, which is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable value of $1,000,000. This leaves room for negotiation, but still ensures a healthy profit if Bob accepts.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Potential Value:**  I'm assuming Bob might value the product higher than me, but I don't have any information to base this on. 
* **Negotiation:** This is just an initial offer. I might need to negotiate further depending on Bob's response.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Offering a higher price means a bigger potential profit, but also a greater chance of rejection."
