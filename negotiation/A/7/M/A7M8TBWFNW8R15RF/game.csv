"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm really interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $11000 for it. What do you think?",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $11000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a compromise at $13500. It's a great price for a unique product like this, and I think you'll find it's worth every penny.",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the compromise, Alice, but $13500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $12500. That's a fair price for both of us, and it would allow me to purchase the product within my budget.",12500.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Bob, but I'm still a bit concerned about the price. I'm willing to make another compromise, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I can offer it to you for $14000. It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it's worth every penny.",14000.0,Alice,5,
