"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe you would find very valuable.  I'm offering it to you for $15000. This is a significant discount from what it's truly worth to me, but I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you.  Let me know if you're interested and we can discuss the details further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is exactly your maximum budget.  While you don't know if it's a great deal or not, there's no incentive to reject the offer. You're getting the product at your limit, and rejecting it only means buying it from John at the same price."
