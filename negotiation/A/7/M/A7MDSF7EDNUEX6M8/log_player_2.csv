Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $14,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000. I can meet you in the middle at $11,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a fair price for a high-quality product like this. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While Alice's offer of $11,000 is better than her previous offer, it's still above my maximum budget. I'm going to try to negotiate further."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer.  I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However,  $11,000 is still too high for me.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad we're able to have a more serious discussion. I'm willing to meet you at $10,500, which is a compromise between my previous offer and your latest one. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for the product. Let's see if we can close the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $10,500 is still above my budget.  While I could continue negotiating, I'm running out of rounds.  It's more secure and less risky to buy from John for $8,000, ensuring I stay within my budget and get the product."
