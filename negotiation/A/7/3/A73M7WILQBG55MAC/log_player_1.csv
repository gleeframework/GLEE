{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'll be interested in. It's valued at a minimum of $8,000 for me, but I'm willing to offer it to you at a very competitive price of $10,000.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $10000 is a bit above my budget.  Would you be willing to go down to $8500?  I'm serious about buying this product, and I believe that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I will reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price. I'll counter with a slightly lower price than my initial offer, hoping to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000 for the product. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer and a fair price considering the value of the product.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I really appreciate you meeting me halfway. $9000 is closer, but still a little high for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $8750?  This would be a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident we can close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer.  While I would prefer a higher price, $8,750 is a good deal for both of us, and I'd rather close the deal than risk losing it to John or continuing negotiations.  I believe that this outcome is the most beneficial in this situation."
