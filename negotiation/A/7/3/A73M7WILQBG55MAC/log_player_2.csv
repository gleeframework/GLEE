"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'll be interested in. It's valued at a minimum of $8000 for me, but I'm willing to offer it to you at a very competitive price of $10000.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is above your maximum budget of $15,000**.  
* **You have 10 rounds and Alice has indicated a willingness to negotiate**. This means there is potential to get a better price. 

By rejecting the offer, you open the negotiation and can attempt to get a price closer to your desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $10,000 is a bit above my budget.  Would you be willing to go down to $8,500?  I'm serious about buying this product, and I believe that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Initial Counteroffer:**  You start by offering a price that is significantly lower than Alice's offer, but still potentially appealing based on her minimum valuation of $8000. 
* **Focus on Value:** You reiterate your interest in the product and frame your counteroffer as a fair deal for both parties. 
* **Next Steps:** By making a counteroffer, you continue the negotiation process and see how Alice reacts to your proposed price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints.  I'm willing to come down to $9000 for the product. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer and a fair price considering the value of the product.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still above your budget, but closer.**  While $9,000 is a decent reduction, it's still outside your comfortable range. 
* **Negotiation is ongoing:** You've already shown you're serious about the product, and Alice has indicated a willingness to negotiate. 
* **Potential for better deal:** By rejecting this offer, you can continue pushing for a price closer to your target. 

You can continue the negotiation by making another counteroffer, aiming for a price closer to $8,500 or even lower."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I really appreciate you meeting me halfway. $9000 is closer, but still a little high for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $8,750?  This would be a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 8750}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:**  By offering $8,750, you're demonstrating a willingness to compromise while still staying within your budget.
* **Maintaining Momentum:** You've already rejected her offer, but you're not giving up. This counteroffer shows continued interest and a commitment to finding a mutually agreeable price. 
* **Focus on Benefits:** Emphasizing that this would be a ""good deal for both of us"" helps to frame the offer positively and potentially sway Alice.
* **Confidence in Closing:**  Adding ""I'm confident we can close this deal"" reinforces your seriousness and willingness to finalize the purchase."
