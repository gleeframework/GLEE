"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am looking to keep my expenses within $10,000. Would you consider reducing the price to $10,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While I'm happy to negotiate, $10,000 is too low for me. I'm willing to consider a counter-offer closer to my initial price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, but $10,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 11000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a price of $10,500 for your product. I believe this is a fair compromise given its value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While $10,500 is closer to what I'm looking for, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'll try to negotiate further with Bob, but I'm also aware that I can always sell to John for a guaranteed $12,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up with a counter-offer.  However, $10,500 still falls short of my minimum. I'm willing to come down to $10,750 as a final concession.  If this isn't acceptable, I may have to explore other options."", ""product_price"": 10750}

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $10,600 is tempting, I'm still hoping to get closer to my minimum acceptable price. I'll see if I can get him up to $10,700 in the next round, but I'm definitely aware that John is a viable option if this doesn't work out."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to keep trying to find a price that works for both of us. How about $10,700? It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find the product worth it. This is my final offer, so let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10700}

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your persistence, Alice. I've carefully considered your offers, and I would like to propose a final price of $10,650 for your product. I believe this is a fair compromise that respects the value of the product while staying within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,650. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,650

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While $10,650 is a good offer, I've reached my limit with Bob.  It's getting close to my minimum, but I don't want to risk not getting a better deal in the last rounds. John is a guaranteed $12,000, and that's what I'm going to go with."
