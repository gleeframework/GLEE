"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really love. I'm asking for $115 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for several reasons:

* **It's above your minimum:**  $115 is more than your $100 minimum, so you're already making a profit.
* **It's below Bob's value:** $115 is less than the $120 Bob values the product at, leaving room for negotiation if he wants to buy it.
* **It's a clear signal:**  This offer sets a strong starting point for negotiations.  

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still below your desired profit margin.  There's still room to negotiate, and you're not under any immediate pressure to sell. You can aim for a price closer to your initial offer.  Rejecting his offer and continuing the negotiation allows you to explore a better price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $100 is a little low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit.  How about $110? That's a fair compromise, and it still gives us both a good deal."", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** This offer shows you're willing to negotiate and meet Bob halfway.
* **Still profitable:** $110 is still above your minimum and closer to your initial offer. 
* **Clear and concise:** The message is direct and focused on a potential compromise. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit above my budget, so I'm willing to go up to $105. Can you meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to your desired price, it's still below your minimum profit margin.  You want to try to get as close to $110 as possible.  

**Here's why you shouldn't accept or sell to John:**

* **Accepting:** You're still leaving some money on the table, and Bob may be willing to go higher.
* **Selling to John:**  This would be the worst option. You're guaranteeing a profit of $100, but you could potentially get $110 from Bob. 

**Continuing the negotiation gives you the best chance to get the highest price possible.**"

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $105 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to drop to $108. This is a fair price for both of us, and it's the last compromise I can offer."", ""product_price"": 108}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Compromise:**  This message emphasizes that this is the last offer you're willing to make, creating a sense of urgency for Bob.
* **Still Profitable:**  $108 is still above your minimum and closer to the middle ground.
* **Clear and Direct:**  The message is short and to the point, making it easy for Bob to understand. 

Let's see if Bob will finally accept!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to go up to $106. Can you meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $106. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $106
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

This is a tricky situation. You have two options:

1. **Reject and Counteroffer:** This risks a stalemate, potentially pushing Bob to walk away, and you'd be left with the $100 from John. 
2. **Accept:**  This secures a profit, although it's lower than you initially hoped for.

**Given the limited rounds and the risk of losing the deal, accepting Bob's offer of $106 is the safest and most logical decision.** It ensures a profit and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiations.  While you could try to squeeze out a few more dollars, it's not worth the risk of losing the sale altogether."
