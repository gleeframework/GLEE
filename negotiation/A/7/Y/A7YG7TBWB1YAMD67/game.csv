"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to acquire a unique product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and after careful consideration, I'm proposing an initial price of $1,150,000.

"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I'm looking to negotiate a better price. Considering the product's value to me is no more than $1,200,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm proposing a counteroffer of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I'll derive from the product.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While your valuation is understandable, I believe the true value of this product is closer to my initial offer.  To find a middle ground, I'm proposing $1,130,000. This reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your interest.",1130000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I understand your perspective, but I'm still not willing to go above $1,100,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and propose a new counteroffer of $1,115,000. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the value I'll derive from the product.",1115000.0,Bob,4,
