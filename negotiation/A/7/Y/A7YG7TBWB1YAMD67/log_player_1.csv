Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to acquire a unique product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and after careful consideration, I'm proposing an initial price of $1,150,000.  This is a starting point for our discussion, and I'm open to understanding your perspective as well."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I'm looking to negotiate a better price. Considering the product's value to me is no more than $1,200,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm proposing a counteroffer of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I'll derive from the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

Bob is anchoring the negotiation close to his maximum valuation. While $1,100,000 is a good profit, there's room for more negotiation. We're still in the early rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While your valuation is understandable, I believe the true value of this product is closer to my initial offer.  To find a middle ground, I'm proposing $1,130,000. This reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your interest."",
""product_price"": 1130000
}
``` 

We're moving closer to Bob's upper limit while still leaving room for negotiation. This offer balances firmness with a willingness to compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I understand your perspective, but I'm still not willing to go above $1,100,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and propose a new counteroffer of $1,115,000. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the value I'll derive from the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,115,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,115,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
``` 

Bob is clearly anchored at $1,100,000 and is only moving in small increments. Accepting his offer of $1,115,000 secures a significant profit above our minimum and avoids the risk of prolonged negotiation or him walking away."
