Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not quite ready to meet you halfway, Bob. I can do $98, but that's as close to $100 as I'm willing to go. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $98.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $98
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly not going to budge much from $98.  It's not worth the continued hassle and potential of ending up with a worse deal to try and negotiate further.  John offers a guaranteed price of $100, which is only slightly more expensive than Alice's last offer."
