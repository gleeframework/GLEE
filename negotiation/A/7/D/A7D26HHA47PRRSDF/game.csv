"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of a price around $9,000. Could you consider that?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $9,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you.  Let's see if we can find a compromise.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down in price. However, $11,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $10,500. Can you consider that?",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're trying to meet me halfway.  How about we split the difference and go with $10,750?  This is a fair compromise, and it gets us closer to a deal.  What do you say?",10750.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $10,750 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $10,500, but I think that's the highest I can go. Can you meet me at that price?",10500.0,Bob,6,
