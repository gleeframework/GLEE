Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000. This is a unique chance to acquire something truly exceptional."", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Stakes:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,000,000, you can afford to be ambitious with Bob.
* **Testing the Waters:** Starting with a significantly higher offer ($1,500,000) allows you to gauge Bob's interest and potentially secure a much higher profit. 
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes the product's value and exclusivity to justify the high price.  

**Possible Outcomes:**

* **Bob Accepts:** You achieve a $500,000 profit beyond your minimum.
* **Bob Negotiates:** This opens the door for you to potentially settle on a price still higher than $1,000,000.
* **Bob Rejects:** You haven't lost anything and can proceed to sell to John at your guaranteed price."
