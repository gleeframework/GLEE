Round 4

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I understand your position, but unfortunately, I cannot go beyond $10,000. I hope we can come to an agreement that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Bob is clearly anchored at $10,000 and unwilling to budge. It's unlikely further negotiation will bridge the gap, and accepting his offer is a significant loss. John offers a guaranteed $15,000, making it the most profitable decision at this stage."
