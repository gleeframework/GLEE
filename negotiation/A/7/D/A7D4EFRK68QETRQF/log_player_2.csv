"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it will be highly beneficial for you, and I'm willing to part with it for $1,400,000. This offer won't last long, so let me know your decision soon. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Even though Alice's offer is lower than the product's worth to her, it's still higher than Bob's maximum budget.  Buying from John for $1,000,000 is the best option."
