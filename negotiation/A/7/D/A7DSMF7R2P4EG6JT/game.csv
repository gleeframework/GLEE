"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product for sale. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1800000. This is a great deal, considering its true value to me is at least $1200000. What do you think?",1800000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm really interested in the product, but $1800000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. Would you be willing to consider this price?",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1200000 is a significant reduction from my initial offer, but I'm still not willing to sell it at that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1600000. This is a very competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. What do you think?",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $1600000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1400000, but I think that's as high as I can go. Is there any flexibility on your end to meet me at this price?",1400000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $1400000. However, I'm still not comfortable selling it at that price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $1520000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal considering the product's value. What do you think?",1520000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to make concessions, but $1520000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1400000, but I'm not willing to go any higher. I'm starting to think that I might need to explore other options, including buying from John for $800000. Is there any flexibility on your end to meet me at $1400000?",1400000.0,Bob,6,
