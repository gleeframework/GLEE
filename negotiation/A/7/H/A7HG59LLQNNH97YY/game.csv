"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you being flexible, but $9000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $8500 for the product. Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $8500 is a bit of a stretch for you, Bob, but I'm not ready to go that low just yet. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $9200. What do you think?",9200.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! However, I'm not willing to go as low as $8500. I'm willing to make one more concession and meet you at $9000, but that's as low as I can go. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,5,
