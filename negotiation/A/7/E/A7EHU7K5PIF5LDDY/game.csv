"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $900,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product.  It's a fair price considering the value to me.  Let's see if we can make this work.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $750,000 is simply too low for me.  The product is worth $800,000 to you, and I'm willing to compromise slightly. How about we meet in the middle at $825,000? This gives us both a fair deal. Let's finalize this and get the transaction moving forward.",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $825,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $800,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value to me and avoids the need to go through another seller. Let's make this happen.",800000.0,Bob,4,
