It's better to reject Alice's offer and try to get a better price. You have a good chance of getting a lower price as Alice is motivated to sell the product."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but $750,000 is simply too low for me.  The product is worth $800,000 to you, and I'm willing to compromise slightly. How about we meet in the middle at $825,000? This gives us both a fair deal. Let's finalize this and get the transaction moving forward.

While Alice is coming down in price, $825,000 is still above your limit. You can likely get a better deal with a counteroffer."
