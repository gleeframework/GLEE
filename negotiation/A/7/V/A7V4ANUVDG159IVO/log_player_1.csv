Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 200}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $200. This is a good starting point as it's above my minimum but leaves room for negotiation.  I'm hoping Bob values the product more than $150 and is willing to pay something closer to my asking price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While $150 is my minimum, I'm not willing to sell at that price right away. I'll try to negotiate with Bob for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}
```

I'm offering a counteroffer of $175. This is a compromise between my initial price and Bob's offer. I'm hoping to find a middle ground that we can both agree on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $155. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $155
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $155 is higher than John's offer of $150, and it's close enough to my minimum price that I'm willing to accept it. It's not ideal, but it's better than selling to John and ensures I get a bit more for the product."
