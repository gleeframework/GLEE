Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm confident you'll be impressed with what it can do. I'm asking for $1,350,000. Let me know what you think, I'm open to discussing further."", 
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High, but Reasonable:** Offering the product at $1,350,000 sets a strong initial price point. While it's above Bob's perceived value, it leaves room for negotiation and keeps the offer within a potentially acceptable range.
* **Emphasizing Value:** The message highlights the product's value to Bob, aiming to influence his perception and justify the price. 
* **Openness to Negotiation:**  The phrase ""open to discussing further"" signals flexibility and invites Bob to engage in a conversation, potentially leading to a mutually agreeable price.

**Strategy:**

The goal is to secure the highest possible price from Bob. By starting high, Alice aims to:

1. **Anchor:** Influence Bob's perception of the product's value.
2. **Negotiate Down:**  Be in a position to potentially negotiate down to a price that remains highly profitable, exceeding the guaranteed $1,500,000 from John.

This strategy balances maximizing potential profit from Bob while having the security of a guaranteed sale to John if needed."
