"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm not sure it's worth $1,600,000. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for it, considering its value and my budget. I'm looking for a fair price that benefits both of us.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not convinced that $1,450,000 is a fair price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,200,000, which is my initial offer. If you're willing to sell it to me for that price, I'd be happy to make a deal.",1200000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price of $1,325,000. I'm willing to meet you at $1,200,000, which is my target price. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. Can we agree on this price?",1200000.0,Bob,6,
