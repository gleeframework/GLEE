"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $120. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Value to Bob:** $150 (max willingness to pay)
* **Alice's Offer:** $120
* **Value to Alice:** $80

Since Alice's offer is lower than Bob's maximum willingness to pay, accepting the offer is the best decision.  Bob gets the product at a lower price than he would pay from John."
