Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $180. I think you'll find it's a great deal."", ""product_price"": 180} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally good practice to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to potentially get closer to Bob's maximum perceived value.
* **Anchoring:** By starting at $180, you're setting a high anchor point. Even if Bob doesn't accept this price, it might make a counteroffer closer to your desired range seem more reasonable.
* **Leaving Room for John:**  While you have a backup offer from John, securing a deal with Bob quickly and efficiently is ideal. By starting high but leaving room for negotiation, you increase the chances of a successful sale to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $180 is a bit high for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $140. Can you consider it? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While $140 is closer to Bob's perceived value, it's still below your minimum acceptable price of $150. You have room to negotiate further since you have a backup offer from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but I can't go as low as $140. How about we meet in the middle at $160?"", ""product_price"": 160}

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** By suggesting a price of $160, you're demonstrating a willingness to negotiate and find a compromise.  
* **Midpoint:** Meeting in the middle ($180 down to $160) can feel like a fair deal to both parties and might make Bob more receptive.
* **Still Above Minimum:** This counteroffer keeps you comfortably above your minimum acceptable price while leaving a small margin for further negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $160 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $145. Can you consider it? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $145
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Below Minimum:** Bob's latest offer of $145 is still below your absolute minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **John's Guarantee:** You have a guaranteed offer from John for $150.  
* **Time Value:** Continuing to negotiate with Bob might not yield a better result and could waste time. Accepting John's offer ensures you get your minimum price without further hassle."
