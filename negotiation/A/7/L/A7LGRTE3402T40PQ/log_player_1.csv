Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe would be very valuable to you. I'm offering it to you for $10,000.  Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always best to start negotiations with a higher price than your minimum. This gives you room to negotiate and still achieve a profitable outcome.
* **Gauging Interest:**  Bob's response will tell you a lot about how much he values the product. If he accepts immediately, you might have been able to go even higher. If he negotiates, you can adjust accordingly. 
* **Backup Option:** Knowing you have a guaranteed sale with John at $8,000 gives you leverage. You're not desperate, which puts you in a stronger position."
