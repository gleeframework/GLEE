Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. I believe it's a fair price, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, but still lower than my minimum acceptable price. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm being friendly and encouraging Bob to engage in the negotiation.
* **Justification:** I'm offering a justification for my price, acknowledging Bob's perspective.

This strategy allows for potential negotiation and gives me the option to accept a counteroffer if it's close to my desired price. If Bob rejects the offer, I can adjust my counteroffer based on his response and the possibility of selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $9,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000, and even lower than my initial offer of $12,000.
* **Potential for better deal:** I believe I can get a higher price from Bob by continuing the negotiation.
* **John's offer is a safety net:**  Even if the negotiation with Bob fails, I have a guaranteed sale to John for a significantly higher price.

Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to send a counteroffer and potentially reach a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $9,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This is a fair compromise that gives us both something to work with. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 11000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  My counteroffer is a compromise, showing flexibility while still staying above my minimum.
* **Appeal to fairness:** I'm emphasizing the ""fairness"" of the offer to increase the chances of acceptance. 
* **Openness to discussion:** I'm inviting Bob to continue the conversation and negotiate further. 

This approach aims to find a middle ground while keeping the negotiation moving forward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $10,500. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:**  $10,500 is only $4,500 below my minimum acceptable price, which is a significant drop. 
* **Risk of losing deal:** Continuing to negotiate with Bob could lead to a lower price or even a complete stalemate, potentially forcing me to sell to John for $15,000. 
* **Time factor:**  The negotiation has already taken a few rounds, and further negotiation could be time-consuming.

Considering the potential risks and the fact that Bob's offer is close to my minimum, I believe it's wise to accept his offer."
