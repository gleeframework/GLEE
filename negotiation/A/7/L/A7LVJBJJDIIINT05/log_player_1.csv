"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high price of $1,000,000. This is a bold move, but it sets the bar high and gives me room to negotiate down if necessary. I'm confident the product is worth at least this much to me, and I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium. If he rejects, I'll be prepared to adjust my offer based on his counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $750,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum threshold of $800,000. I'm willing to risk losing this deal with Bob and continue negotiating. I believe I can secure a better price by making a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm counteroffering with a price of $900,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but it's still above my minimum threshold and leaves room for further negotiation.  I believe this is a fair price given the value of the product to me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While I'd love to get closer to my initial asking price,  $850,000 is a good deal and above my minimum threshold.  It's also a significant improvement over Bob's previous offers. There's always a risk that I could get a better price if I keep negotiating, but I don't want to risk losing the deal altogether."
