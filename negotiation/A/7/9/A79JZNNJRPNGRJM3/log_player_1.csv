"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that's very valuable to me. I'm offering it to you for $15,000. It's a great deal for both of us. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. This gives me room to negotiate and potentially secure a good deal.
* **Positive Tone:** Using a friendly and positive tone can help build rapport with Bob and encourage him to consider the offer.
* **Highlighting Value:**  I'm emphasizing the value of the product without revealing my true minimum. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  I'm not setting a hard deadline or ultimatum, which might make Bob less inclined to negotiate."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, but still leaves room for negotiation.** I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price.
* **I'm not desperate to sell immediately.** I'm willing to risk a few more rounds of negotiation to potentially secure a better deal.
* **Selling to John is always an option, but I'm not ready to give up on a potentially higher price just yet.**"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate your interest. While $12,000 is closer, I'm still hoping to get a bit more for this product. How about we settle on $13,500?  It's a fair price considering the value I'm offering."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a compromise:** My counteroffer is closer to Bob's price, demonstrating my willingness to negotiate while still keeping the price above my minimum.

* **Positive and open tone:** I'm maintaining a friendly tone to encourage further negotiation."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $12,500 is still a bit lower than what I need. Let's split the difference and agree on $13,000. This would be a fair price for both of us, and it would allow us to finalize this deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:**  I'm offering a price that's exactly halfway between my previous offer and Bob's latest offer, showing a willingness to compromise. 
* **Emphasizing fairness:** I'm highlighting that this price would be fair for both of us, aiming to appeal to Bob's sense of reason.
* **Adding urgency (slightly):**  By suggesting we finalize the deal, I'm subtly increasing the pressure to accept."

Round 6

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my desired price:** While Bob's offer is still lower than my ideal, it's only $250 away.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  With only 4 rounds left, the risk of continuing the negotiation is high. I might not get a better offer, and I risk losing the deal altogether.
* **Securing the Sale:**  Accepting Bob's offer ensures a sale and guarantees me a profit significantly higher than selling to John."
