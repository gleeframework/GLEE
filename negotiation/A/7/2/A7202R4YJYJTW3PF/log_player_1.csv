Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product, and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $160 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 160} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally good to start negotiations higher than your desired price. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest. 
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffers:**  A price of $160 is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value, so he's likely to counter. This gives you information about how much he's willing to pay.
* **John as a Backup:**  Knowing that John will buy the product for $120 gives you a strong fallback position. You don't have to accept any offer below that price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering the product. I believe I can offer you $120 for it, which is within your asking range but also allows me to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While I started high, Bob's offer of $120 meets my minimum acceptable price. There's no guarantee I can negotiate a higher price with him, and I risk him walking away. Accepting ensures I make a profit and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation."
