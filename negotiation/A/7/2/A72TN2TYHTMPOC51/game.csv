"I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to acquire this exceptional product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,200,000, but I'm open to negotiations.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but that price is a little high for me.  Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $900,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a discount of $50,000 from the initial price, bringing it down to $1,150,000. This is the lowest I can go, but I'm confident you'll find it a fair price for this exceptional product.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  However, $1,150,000 is still a bit too high for my budget.  Would you be willing to accept $1,050,000?",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm willing to meet you at $1,050,000, but I need to make a profit. I can offer you a compromise at $1,100,000, which is $50,000 more than your offer. This is the best I can do, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we seem to be getting closer.  I'm willing to increase my offer slightly to $1,075,000.  I believe that is a fair compromise and would allow us both to walk away happy.",1075000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I'm still not convinced that $1,075,000 is enough to justify the product's value. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,075,000 and $1,150,000, which is $1,112,500. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us.",1125000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, this is a fair offer, but I'm afraid I can't go any higher than $1,090,000.  Let me know if you're willing to work with that.",1090000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob. I can see that you're willing to pay a premium for this product, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you at $1,095,000, which is $5,000 more than your last offer. This is my final compromise, and I hope we can agree on this price.",1095000.0,Alice,9,
