"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 180}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $180. This leaves room for negotiation, but also reflects the product's value to me.  I'm confident that Bob will be willing to pay a premium, but I'm also prepared to walk away and sell to John if the deal doesn't work out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 165}

I'm lowering my price to $165, which is still above my minimum acceptable price.  This shows flexibility while still maintaining a good profit margin.  I'm hoping this counteroffer will entice Bob to close the deal."

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still not willing to sell for $145.  I'm going to hold out for a higher price and make a counteroffer in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Bob's offer: The product price will be $152.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is only $2 above my minimum acceptable price, it's still a profit. I'm concerned about running out of rounds and being forced to sell to John for the same price.  I'm going to accept Bob's offer."
