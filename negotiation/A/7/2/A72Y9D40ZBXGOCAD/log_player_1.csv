Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone like you, and I'm willing to part with it for $1,400,000. This is a limited-time offer, so please let me know your decision soon."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, your goal is to see if Bob will pay more. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $1,400,000 leaves a significant margin above Bob's perceived value ($800,000) but is still enticing compared to you walking away and getting your guaranteed price. 
* **Urgency:** The phrase ""limited-time offer"" introduces a sense of urgency, potentially encouraging Bob to make a quicker decision."
