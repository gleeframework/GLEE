"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm really interested in your product but $14,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now. Would you be willing to come down to $13,500?",13500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $13,500 is still a little lower than I'd like to go. How about we split the difference and settle on $13,750? It's a fair compromise and allows both of us to get a good deal.",13750.0,Alice,3,
