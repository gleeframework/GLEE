Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm really interested in your product but $14,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now. Would you be willing to come down to $13,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $13,500 is still a little lower than I'd like to go. How about we split the difference and settle on $13,750? It's a fair compromise and allows both of us to get a good deal."", ""product_price"": 13750}
