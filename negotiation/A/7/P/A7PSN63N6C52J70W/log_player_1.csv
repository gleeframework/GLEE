Round 2

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $7,500 is too low for me, and I'm confident I can get a better price from him or from John."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $7,500 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $8,500 is my absolute minimum.  This is still a great price for you, considering what you're getting.  Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 8500}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $8,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $7,500 and $8,500. How about $8,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While I'd prefer to get a little more, $8,000 is a fair price, and I don't want to risk losing the deal by continuing to negotiate."
