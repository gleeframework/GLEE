"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I believe this product has immense value, and I'm confident it can be a game-changer for you. I'm offering it to you for $1,000,000. This price reflects the potential I see in this product for your business. I'm open to discussing this further, but I'm confident this is a fair price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,000,000 is still too high.  You can likely get a better deal by counter-offering.  You're willing to pay up to $1,200,000, so there's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your offer and see the potential in this product, $1,000,000 is a bit too high for my current budget.  I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. This reflects a fair value for both of us, allowing me to invest in this product while still staying within my budget."", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, and I appreciate you recognizing the value of this product.  While $900,000 is a good offer, it's still a bit below what I need to make this transaction worthwhile.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000, which reflects a fair compromise.  Let's see if we can find common ground and make this deal happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $950,000, which is still within your budget and a better price than John's offer of $1,200,000.  While you could try to negotiate further, there's a risk Alice could reject your counteroffer and you'd be left with John's higher price. Accepting Alice's offer is the most logical choice in this situation."
