"Bob, I believe this product has immense value, and I'm confident it can be a game-changer for you. I'm offering it to you for $1,000,000.

"Alice, while I appreciate your offer and see the potential in this product, $1,000,000 is a bit too high for my current budget.  I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. This reflects a fair value for both of us, allowing me to invest in this product while still staying within my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, and I appreciate you recognizing the value of this product.  While $900,000 is a good offer, it's still a bit below what I need to make this transaction worthwhile.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000, which reflects a fair compromise.  Let's see if we can find common ground and make this deal happen.",950000.0,Alice,3,
