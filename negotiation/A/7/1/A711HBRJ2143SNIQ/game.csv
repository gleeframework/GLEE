,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer!  $150 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go.  How about $105?  I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is tight.",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $150 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $105. How about we meet in the middle at $132.50? I think that's a fair price for this great product.",132.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $132.50 is still a bit high for me.  Let's split the difference and go with $115.  That's a fair price for both of us, and I can get this deal done today.",115.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I'm not comfortable going as low as $115. How about we try $130? It's a bit higher than your last offer, but it's still a good compromise.",130.0,Alice,5,
