"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $150. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Alice's offer is too high. You can get the product for $100 from John, so it's better to reject Alice's offer and make a counteroffer."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $150 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $105. How about we meet in the middle at $132.50? I think that's a fair price for this great product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $132.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $132.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

``` 

While $132.50 is lower than Alice's initial offer, it's still higher than what you're willing to pay and what you can get from John. It's worth trying to negotiate further."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $132.50 is still a bit high for me.  Let's split the difference and go with $115.  That's a fair price for both of us, and I can get this deal done today."", ""product_price"": 115}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I'm not comfortable going as low as $115. How about we try $130? It's a bit higher than your last offer, but it's still a good compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130

Alice is not budging much, and while $130 is lower than her initial offer, it's still higher than your maximum budget and what you can get from John.  It's time to cut your losses and go with the sure thing."
