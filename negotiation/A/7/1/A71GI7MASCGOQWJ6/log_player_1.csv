Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}

I'm starting high, aiming for a significant profit. This will give me room to negotiate downwards if necessary.  I'm confident the product is valuable enough to Bob that he might be willing to pay a premium."

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

Bob's offer is closer to my desired price, but I'm still holding out for more.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}

I'm raising the price slightly from Bob's offer. I want to see if he's willing to meet me halfway.  If he's serious about buying the product, I believe he'll be willing to pay a little more."

Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, and I'm running out of time.  It's a good deal, considering John's offer."
