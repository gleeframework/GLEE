"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd love! I'm offering it to you for $135. It's a great deal, considering its value to me is much higher. Let me know what you think!",135.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but $135 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $125.",125.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product! While I understand $135 was a bit high, $125 is unfortunately too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $130? I think that's a fair price considering the product's value to both of us. Let me know what you think.",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still a bit hesitant about the price, but I'm willing to meet you at $130. However, I was thinking we could go even lower, to $128. I'm trying to stay within my budget.",128.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $128 is still a bit lower than I'm hoping for. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $129. This is really my final offer, so let me know if you're interested.",129.0,Alice,5,
