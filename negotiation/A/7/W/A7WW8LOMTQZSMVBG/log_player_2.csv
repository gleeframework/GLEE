"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I think you'd really enjoy. I'm willing to offer it to you at a special price of $110. It's a great deal considering its value, and I believe it would be a worthwhile investment for you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

While Alice's offer of $110 is tempting, you know you can get the product for $100 from John.  You're better off rejecting Alice's offer and going with your guaranteed lower price."
