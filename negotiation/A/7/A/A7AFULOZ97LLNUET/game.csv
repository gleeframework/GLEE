"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the opportunity, $600,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $500,000 for the product, considering its value to me.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $500,000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $550,000. This is a fair price considering the value you'll get from it.",550000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $550,000 is still a bit high for me, but I'm willing to go up to $525,000.  This seems like a fair price considering the value of the product to both of us.  Let's see if we can close the deal.",525000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your concerns, and I'm willing to meet you halfway again. Considering the value of the product to you, I'm willing to offer it to you for $525,000, but I'd like to add a small premium for the convenience of a quick sale. I'm willing to meet you at $530,000. This is a fair price considering the value you'll get from it.",530000.0,Alice,5,
