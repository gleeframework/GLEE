Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, potentially even exceeding $1,200,000.  I'm willing to part with it for $1,500,000. This is a limited-time offer, so please let me know your decision promptly."", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, you can afford to start high with Bob.
* **Value Emphasis:** The message emphasizes the potential value exceeding $1,200,000 to make the price seem more reasonable.
* **Urgency and Exclusivity:**  The ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""limited-time offer"" are psychological tactics to encourage a quicker, more emotionally-driven decision from Bob. 

**Important Note:** This is just one strategy. Depending on your knowledge of Bob's personality and negotiation style, you might adjust your approach."
