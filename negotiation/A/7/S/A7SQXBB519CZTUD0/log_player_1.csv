Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. However, $900,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Considering the product's value to me, I'd be willing to pay $850,000.  This is a fair price that allows us both to benefit from the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
