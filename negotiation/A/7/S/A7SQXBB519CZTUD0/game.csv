"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just getting started, I'd like to make you an offer. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value to you is $1,000,000. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. However, $900,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Considering the product's value to me, I'd be willing to pay $850,000.  This is a fair price that allows us both to benefit from the deal.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not quite ready to accept $850,000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell it to you for $875,000. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's true value to you.
