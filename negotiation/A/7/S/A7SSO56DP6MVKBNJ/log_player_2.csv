"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $140. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

It's better to try and negotiate a lower price with Alice.  While $140 is still within your budget, you can potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $140 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. How about $130?  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 130}
