Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for both of us. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **My minimum:** I value the product at $15,000, so I won't go lower than that.
* **Bob's value:** Bob values the product at $10,000. This means there's room for negotiation.
* **John's offer:** John is a backup buyer, guaranteeing me $15,000. This gives me a safety net and allows me to be more flexible with Bob. 
* **The offer:** Offering $12,000 is a good compromise. It's a better price for Bob than my minimum, and it's still a significant profit for me. 

**Why this approach is good:**

* **Maximizes profit:**  The offer is likely to be accepted by Bob as it's a better deal for him than his current value.
* **Minimizes risk:** John's offer provides a safety net, ensuring I don't lose out on a substantial amount of money. 
* **Builds potential future relationships:** By offering a fair deal, I build goodwill with Bob and potentially create a good business relationship for future transactions."
