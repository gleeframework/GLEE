Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly.  Given its value, I'm asking for $15,000.  What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Potential Profit:** Starting with a higher offer allows Alice to potentially secure a price significantly above her minimum. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  The $15,000 offer gives Bob room to negotiate down. Even if Bob negotiates, Alice is likely to secure a price higher than John's offer. 
* **Time Value:** While there's a risk Bob might reject the offer, the potential for a higher profit outweighs the guaranteed $10,000 from John in this scenario."
