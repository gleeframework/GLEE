"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $145. It's a great deal and I'm confident you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $145
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's initial offer of $145 is higher than Bob's maximum budget of $120. It's better to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product but $145 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $125 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 125}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting point:** Bob wants to stay within his budget.  
* **Counter-offer strategy:** A $125 counteroffer is a significant step down from Alice's initial price, but still allows room for potential negotiation. 
* **Reasoning:** Bob's message acknowledges Alice's offer and provides a reason for the counteroffer (budget).  It also leaves the door open for further discussion."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $125 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $135. This is still a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Goal:** Bob wants to save as much money as possible. 
* **Alice's offer:** $135 is still above Bob's $120 limit.
* **Strategic consideration:**  While closer to Bob's budget, there's still room to negotiate further, and Bob should try to get a lower price. 
* **Option 3:** Buying from John would guarantee the product at Bob's desired price, but rejecting Alice's offer keeps the negotiation open.  

By rejecting Alice's offer, Bob can counter with a lower price and potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down in price, but $135 is still a bit too much for me.  I'm ready to pay $130. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 130}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Staying within budget:** $130 is still within Bob's budget of $120, allowing room for further negotiation.
* **Incremental approach:** Bob is gradually lowering the price, demonstrating a willingness to compromise.
* **Positive tone:**  Bob keeps the message positive and emphasizes the ""fairness"" of his offer.
* **Seeking agreement:**  Bob explicitly states his desire to reach an agreement, putting pressure on Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob,  I understand your position. I'm willing to go down to $132. This is a very fair price considering the value of the product. I hope we can come to an agreement.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $132. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $132
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Goal:** Bob wants to save as much money as possible. 
* **Alice's offer:** $132 is still above Bob's $120 budget. 
* **Strategic consideration:**  While closer, it's worth trying to negotiate a lower price.  There's still room to decrease the price further.
* **Option 3:** Buying from John is always available, but rejection allows Bob to continue negotiating.

By rejecting, Bob can make a final counteroffer and potentially secure a better deal before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $132. I'm willing to go to $131.  This is my final offer, as it's as close as I can get to my budget.  I'm confident we can finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 131}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final offer:** Bob signals this is his last counteroffer, putting pressure on Alice.
* **Small concession:** A $1 difference shows Bob is serious about the deal but still trying to minimize his expenditure.
* **Confidence:**  The message conveys Bob's belief in the deal and the ""finality"" of his offer. 
* **Budget focus:**  Bob reinforces that his budget is a key constraint."
