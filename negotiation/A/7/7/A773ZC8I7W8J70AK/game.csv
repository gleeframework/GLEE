"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $5,000?",5000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $5,000 is definitely below what I need to make this worthwhile,  I'm willing to be flexible. How about we meet in the middle at $9,000? That's still a good deal for you, considering the value of the product, and allows me to continue negotiating.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. $9,000 is closer, but I'm still aiming a bit lower. Would you be willing to do $6,500?",6500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your persistence.  $6,500 is still a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down further. How about we settle on $8,000?  This reflects the product's value and allows me to keep negotiating with you. What do you think?",8000.0,Alice,5,
