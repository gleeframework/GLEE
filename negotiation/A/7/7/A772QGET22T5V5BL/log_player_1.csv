Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", 
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to your product's value ($120) as possible.
* **Bob's Valuation:** You know Bob values the product at $80.
* **John as Backup:** You have a guaranteed sale at $120 to John if Bob refuses.

Offering the product at $119 creates a sense of urgency (""limited time"") and positions it as a slight discount while still maximizing potential profit from Bob. If Bob declines, you haven't lost anything, as you'll sell it to John at your desired price."
