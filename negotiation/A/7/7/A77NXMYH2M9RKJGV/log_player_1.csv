Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000.  It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $800,000.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$1,200,000** is a price that is well above Bob's perceived value but still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* This leaves room for negotiation and potentially a higher profit for me. 
* The message is friendly and emphasizes the value proposition for Bob, encouraging him to consider the offer. 
* This strategy aims to initiate the negotiation process while still maintaining a strong starting position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to consider your product, but I think $1,200,000 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,000,000. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $1,000,000 is better than Bob's initial valuation of $800,000, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I believe I can get a better deal by continuing the negotiation.  

Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a price closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us. Let's try to reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$1,100,000** is a compromise price that is still above Bob's initial counteroffer but closer to my desired value. 
* This shows I'm willing to negotiate but not willing to settle for a significantly lower price.
* The message is polite but firm, emphasizing the value of the product and the importance of finding a fair deal for both parties.
* This strategy aims to maintain control over the negotiation and move towards a more favorable outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,100,000. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $950,000. Can we meet in the middle again? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $950,000 is a decent offer and significantly better than Bob's initial offer, it is still far below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. My goal is to maximize my profit, and I believe I can still achieve a better price through further negotiation. 

Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to make a counteroffer and potentially reach a price closer to my desired value. Additionally, since John is willing to pay $1,500,000, I have a strong fallback option in case negotiations with Bob fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $950,000 is still significantly below my minimum price. To be fair to both of us, I'm willing to meet you halfway on our last offers, and offer you the product for $1,025,000.  This shows my commitment to reaching a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's seal the deal."", ""product_price"": 1025000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$1,025,000** is a compromise price that's the midpoint between my previous offer of $1,100,000 and Bob's current offer of $950,000. This demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while still maintaining a reasonable profit margin.
* The message is direct and emphasizes the importance of finding a mutually beneficial agreement. It also subtly reinforces my commitment to a fair deal, aiming to sway Bob's decision.
* This strategy aims to  push the negotiation closer to my desired price while also showing flexibility, potentially leading to a successful agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,025,000. I'd like to make one more counteroffer of $900,000. If that's not acceptable, I'll consider buying the product from John for $800,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's latest offer of $900,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  Even though he's mentioning John, I believe that John is likely aware of Bob's negotiation tactics and wouldn't actually sell the product for $800,000. 

Furthermore,  continuing to negotiate with Bob is unlikely to yield a better outcome. He's demonstrating a pattern of offering lower prices, and I've reached a point where the potential risk of further negotiation outweighs the potential gain.  

Therefore, selling the product to John for $1,500,000 guarantees my minimum acceptable price and secures a higher profit."
