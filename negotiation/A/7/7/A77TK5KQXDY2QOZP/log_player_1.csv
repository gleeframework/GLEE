Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $150. It's a fantastic deal and I'm confident you'll find it valuable."", 
""product_price"": 150
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $100, you want to see if you can get more from Bob.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $150 gives Bob the impression there might be room for negotiation if he wants to haggle. 
* **Avoid Appearing Desperate:** If you start too high (e.g., $200), Bob might assume you're desperate and refuse to negotiate at all.

It's a balancing act! You want to aim high enough to potentially earn more than $100, but not so high that Bob walks away without considering the offer."
