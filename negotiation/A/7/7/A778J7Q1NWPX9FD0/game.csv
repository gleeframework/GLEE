"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product.  Given its potential value, I believe a starting price of $1,300,000 is fair.  What are your thoughts?",1300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm.  While I see the potential value, $1,300,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'd like to offer $1,000,000.  This price reflects a reasonable compromise and allows for a mutually beneficial transaction.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the offer and the thoughtful response.  I understand your perspective, but $1,000,000 is significantly below its true value. I could consider coming down to $1,200,000. This offer still leaves us both with a good deal.  What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  $1,200,000 is closer, but I'm still not there yet. I'm willing to go to $1,100,000.  This offer reflects a significant compromise from my previous offer, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we split the difference and settle at $1,150,000? This feels like a fair compromise that recognizes the product's value while still giving you a great deal.",1150000.0,Alice,5,
