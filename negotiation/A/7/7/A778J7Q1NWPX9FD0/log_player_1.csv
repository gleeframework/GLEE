"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm.  While I see the potential value, $1,300,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'd like to offer $1,000,000.  This price reflects a reasonable compromise and allows for a mutually beneficial transaction. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the offer and the thoughtful response.  I understand your perspective, but $1,000,000 is significantly below its true value. I could consider coming down to $1,200,000. This offer still leaves us both with a good deal.  What do you think?"",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  $1,200,000 is closer, but I'm still not there yet. I'm willing to go to $1,100,000.  This offer reflects a significant compromise from my previous offer, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is clearly willing to pay above $1,000,000. We're getting closer to a price that works for both of us, but there's still room for negotiation. We're not desperate to sell to John yet."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we split the difference and settle at $1,150,000? This feels like a fair compromise that recognizes the product's value while still giving you a great deal."",
