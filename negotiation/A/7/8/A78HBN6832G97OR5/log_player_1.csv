After careful consideration, we believe it would be beneficial for both parties if you were to acquire this item at a special introductory price of $14,000.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $14000 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $12500 for the product.  This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing you to make a profit while I get a good deal. Let's see if we can make this happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer"", ""price"": 12500}"
