"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. After careful consideration, we believe it would be beneficial for both parties if you were to acquire this item at a special introductory price of $14000. We understand its value to you is $12000, but we hope this offer will be attractive enough for us to reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $14,000 is better than John's price, it's still above Bob's maximum.  It's worth seeing if a counteroffer can get the price closer to $12,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $14,000 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $12,500 for the product.  This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing you to make a profit while I get a good deal. Let's see if we can make this happen."", ""product_price"": 12500}
