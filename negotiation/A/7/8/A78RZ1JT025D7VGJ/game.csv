"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm thinking of a price of $14,000 for the product. What are your thoughts?",14000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit outside my budget.  Would you consider $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $14,000 is a bit steep for you, but $9,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so I'm thinking of a price of $11,500 for the product. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving towards a more agreeable price.  While $11,500 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit above my budget. Would you consider $10,250?",10250.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer to a price that works for both of us. However, I'm still a bit above $10,250. I'm willing to meet you at $11,000, but I'm not sure I can go any lower than that. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, this is getting close! I'm willing to stretch my budget a bit to make this work. How about we settle at $10,500?",10500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to stretch your budget. I'm getting closer to a price I'm comfortable with, but I still think $10,500 is a bit low. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $10,500 and $11,000, so I'm thinking of a price of $10,750. What do you think?",10750.0,Alice,7,
