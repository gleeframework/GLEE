"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product, and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm willing to let it go for $12,000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer!  $12,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $8,500?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $8,500 is a bit too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer - how about $10,000?  This is a fair price for a product that's worth so much to you.  Let's find a compromise.",10000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $10,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $9,000. Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $9,250?",9250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $9,250 is still a little low for me. How about $9,500?  That's a good compromise, and it gets us closer to finalizing this deal.",9500.0,Alice,5,
