"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product, and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm willing to let it go for $12,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's significantly higher than my minimum price of $8,000, but still leaves room for negotiation. It also shows Bob that I'm serious about selling, but I'm not desperate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer!  $12,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $8,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is a bit too low, especially considering I'm confident I can get more. I'll reject and counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $8,500 is a bit too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer - how about $10,000?  This is a fair price for a product that's worth so much to you.  Let's find a compromise."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $10,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $9,000. Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $9,250? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,250 is closer to my desired price, I still believe I can get closer to $10,000. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to push for a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $9,250 is still a little low for me. How about $9,500?  That's a good compromise, and it gets us closer to finalizing this deal."", ""product_price"": 9500}
