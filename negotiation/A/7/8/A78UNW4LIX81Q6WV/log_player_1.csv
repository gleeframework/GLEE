Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer is a compromise:

* **It's more than your minimum:**  $1,200,000 is significantly higher than your minimum acceptable price of $800,000. 
* **It's less than Bob's maximum:** $1,200,000 is less than the $1,500,000 the product is worth to Bob, giving him a potential profit.

This strategy aims to maximize your earnings while still making the deal attractive enough for Bob to accept."
