"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $130 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $100?",100.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $130 might be a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $100. How about we meet in the middle at $125? I think that's a fair price for this amazing product.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you working with me, Alice. How about $110? That's a fair compromise, I think.",110.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $110 is a good compromise, Bob, but I'm still not willing to sell it for that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $125 and $110, which would be $117.50. Is that something you'd be interested in?",117.5,Alice,5,
