"Bob, I have a fantastic opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that I believe will be incredibly valuable to your business. I know you're interested, and I'm confident this product could be worth $1200000 to you. To make this a win-win, I'm willing to sell it to you for $1000000. This gives you a significant return on your investment and ensures I get a fair price for a product I value at $800000. What do you think?  ",1000000.0,Alice,1,
