Alice's offer:

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $11,500, which is a slight increase from your last offer. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you is $15,000 and I'm willing to compromise.

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go much lower. Accepting at $11,500 secures a significant saving compared to John's $15,000 price."
