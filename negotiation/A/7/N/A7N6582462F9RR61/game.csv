"Thank you for the offer, Alice. However, I think the price is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $18,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value and my budget.",18000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming back with an offer.  While $18,000 is closer to the mark, I'm still looking to recoup a bit more of the true value of this product. How about we meet in the middle at $20,000? I'm confident you won't find a better deal for this quality.",20000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, Alice, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to go up to $19,000, but that's my absolute limit. I'd love to find a mutually beneficial agreement. Can you consider my revised offer?",19000.0,Bob,4,
