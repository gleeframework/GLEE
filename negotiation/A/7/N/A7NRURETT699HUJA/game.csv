,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price, but I need to get at least $950,000 for this product.  It's a fair price considering its value, and I'm confident it will be a great investment for you. Let's see if we can find some common ground.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still interested in the product, but $950,000 is a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $900,000 still doesn't quite work for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $925,000? This is a significant reduction from my initial offer and a fair price considering the value of the product. I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement on this final counteroffer.",925000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I'm willing to go a little further.  $915,000 isn't quite there for me.  How about $920,000?  This is a compromise, and I'm confident we can close the deal at this price.  Let's make this happen.",920000.0,Alice,7,
