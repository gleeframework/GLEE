"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's above Bob's value of $800,000, but it leaves room for negotiation.  It also gives me a good starting point to potentially earn more than my minimum of $1,200,000 if I sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. Would you be willing to meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is higher than his initial value, it's still far below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  I have 10 rounds and the option to sell to John at a much higher price, so there's no reason to accept Bob's offer at this point.  I will continue negotiating with Bob to see if I can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price, but I need to get at least $950,000 for this product.  It's a fair price considering its value, and I'm confident it will be a great investment for you. Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 950000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $950,000 is a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $900,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob is moving closer to my desired price, $900,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price. I have several rounds remaining and the option to sell to John for a much higher price. It's worth continuing to negotiate with Bob to see if I can push the price closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $900,000 still doesn't quite work for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $925,000? This is a significant reduction from my initial offer and a fair price considering the value of the product. I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement on this final counteroffer."", ""product_price"": 925000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I was thinking more along the lines of $915,000. Would you be willing to accept this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $915,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $915,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my target, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. With several rounds left, and the option to sell to John for a much higher price, it's wise to continue negotiating to see if I can push the price even higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm willing to go a little further.  $915,000 isn't quite there for me.  How about $920,000?  This is a compromise, and I'm confident we can close the deal at this price.  Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 920000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm not comfortable going above $915,000. I think this is a fair price considering the value of the product. Would you be willing to accept this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $915,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $915,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

We've reached a stalemate. Bob is firm on $915,000, and I'm holding out for a higher price. With only two rounds left, the chances of closing a deal with Bob at a price I'm happy with are diminishing.  Selling to John guarantees me $1,200,000, which is well above my minimum acceptable price and ensures a profitable outcome.  It's time to move on and secure the sale with John."
