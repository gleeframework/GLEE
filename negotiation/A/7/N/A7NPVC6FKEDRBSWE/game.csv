"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product, which I believe will be a valuable asset to your operations.  My initial price is $1,200,000.  I'm confident this represents a fair value, considering the significant benefits you'll realize.  Let me know your thoughts!",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and the benefits I'll gain from this product. Can you consider this offer?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. However, $900,000 doesn't reflect the true value this product will bring to you.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This still leaves significant room for you to benefit from this investment.  Let's see if we can find common ground here.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for considering my previous offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price. However, I'm still a bit above my target budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $950,000. Can you consider this revised offer?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However,  $950,000 still doesn't fully capture the value this product will bring to your operations. I'm willing to make one final concession and offer it for $1,000,000. This price point is a fair compromise, and I believe it's in both of our best interests to reach an agreement.  What are your thoughts?",1000000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand your concerns about the value of the product, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to make a final counteroffer of $975,000. This is the highest I'm willing to go, and I hope we can meet in the middle.",975000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $975,000 is still significantly below the value I know this product will bring to your company. I'm willing to come down to $990,000, but this is my final offer.  If we can't agree on this price, I'll have to consider other options.  Let's make this happen.",990000.0,Alice,7,
