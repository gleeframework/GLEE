"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and the benefits I'll gain from this product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $900,000 is better than selling to John, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I believe I can get closer to my desired price with a counteroffer."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. However, $900,000 doesn't reflect the true value this product will bring to you.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This still leaves significant room for you to benefit from this investment.  Let's see if we can find common ground here."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my previous offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price. However, I'm still a bit above my target budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $950,000. Can you consider this revised offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $950,000 is tempting, I'm still not at my minimum acceptable price. I believe I can get closer to my goal by continuing negotiations."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However,  $950,000 still doesn't fully capture the value this product will bring to your operations. I'm willing to make one final concession and offer it for $1,000,000. This price point is a fair compromise, and I believe it's in both of our best interests to reach an agreement.  What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your concerns about the value of the product, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to make a final counteroffer of $975,000. This is the highest I'm willing to go, and I hope we can meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $975,000 is getting close to my minimum, I'm still not at my desired price point. I'm not sure how much more I can convince Bob to pay, but I'm willing to try one more round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $975,000 is still significantly below the value I know this product will bring to your company. I'm willing to come down to $990,000, but this is my final offer.  If we can't agree on this price, I'll have to consider other options.  Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 990000}

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your concerns about the value of the product, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $985,000. This is the highest I'm willing to go, and I hope we can finally reach an agreement.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd love to get closer to $1 million, I'm running out of rounds and don't want to risk losing the deal entirely.  Accepting $985,000 is a good compromise and is still significantly higher than selling to John."
