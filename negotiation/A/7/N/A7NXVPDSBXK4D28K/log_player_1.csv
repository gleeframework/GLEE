{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $8,000 to you, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's slightly above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. If Bob rejects, we can then counteroffer closer to his value or consider selling to John for $10,000 if the negotiation stalls."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate it, but I am only willing to pay $8000 for the product. This aligns better with my budget and the value I place on it. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $8,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. I'm willing to negotiate further, so I will reject Bob's offer and counter with a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but unfortunately I can't go that low. I'm willing to come down to $8,500, which is still a great deal for you considering the value of the product. This is a final offer, let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 8500}
