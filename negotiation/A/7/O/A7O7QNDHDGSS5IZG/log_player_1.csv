Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $11,500. I think it's a fair price considering its value. Let me know what you think."",
""product_price"": 11500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  While we know Bob values the product at $10,000, we want to maximize our profit. Starting with a price closer to our minimum ($12,000) allows room for negotiation.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** Offering $11,500 leaves space for Bob to counter-offer, potentially meeting somewhere in the middle.
* **Considering the alternative:** Even if Bob rejects the offer, we have a guaranteed sale at $12,000 to John. This knowledge allows us to be firmer in our pricing. 

**Important Note:** There's a risk that Bob might reject an offer above $10,000 outright. However,  we're aiming to get the best possible price, and this strategy gives us a good chance of achieving that."
