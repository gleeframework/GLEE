"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth $120 to you, and we're looking to maximize our earnings. Let's start with an offer of $150. We believe this price reflects the value of the product and is fair for both parties. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is significantly higher than what the product is worth to Bob. It's in Bob's best interest to reject this offer and try to negotiate a lower price.  There are still 9 rounds remaining, providing ample opportunity to reach a mutually acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the quality of your product, $150 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $100 for it, which is still a fair price considering its value to me.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 100} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. After careful consideration, we've decided to counter with a price of $120 for the product. This aligns closely with its value to you and also allows us to reach a fair agreement. We hope this meets your expectations and look forward to your response. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $120 is exactly the maximum value Bob is willing to pay. While there are still 7 rounds remaining, it's unlikely that further negotiation will lead to a lower price. Accepting the offer guarantees a successful purchase at a price that's still favorable to Bob."
