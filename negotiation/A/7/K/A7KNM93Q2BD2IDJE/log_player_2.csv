"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this great product to you today. I think it would be perfect for your needs. I'm asking for $200 to start. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Alice's offer is too high. It's worth $150 to you, and she's asking for $200. It makes sense to try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I really appreciate it, but $200 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay. I'm happy to pay $150 for the product, given it's value to me. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm hoping to get a little closer to my asking price. How about we meet in the middle at $175? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $175. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $175
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Alice's offer is still too high. While it's closer to my target, I can still try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $175 is still outside my budget. I'm happy to meet you halfway at $162.50. This feels like a fair compromise given our both our positions."", ""product_price"": 162.50}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  How about we split the difference again and settle at $168.75? This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $168.75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $168.75
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's offer is still above my target price of $150.  While there's a chance we could continue negotiating, I'm not confident I'll be able to get her down to my price within the remaining rounds.  It's better to secure the product from John at my target price."
