"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I believe a starting price of $1,300,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"",

}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in this product, $1,300,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to offer $950,000, reflecting the product's worth to you and the potential value for me.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Bob's offer is significantly lower than our minimum and still far from his perceived value. We have room to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is significantly below its true value and potential for profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway and come down to $1,125,000. This reflects the product's worth and leaves a fair margin for both of us."",
""product_price"": 1125000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,125,000 is still a bit high for me.  Let's split the difference. I'm offering $1,037,500.  This is a fair price that acknowledges the value of the product while ensuring a profitable deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,037,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,037,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

We're making progress, but Bob is moving slowly, consistently offering the midpoint. While $1,037,500 is tempting, we still have room to negotiate and aim higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're getting closer. I recognize your desire for a fair deal, and I'm willing to be flexible. How about we settle on $1,090,000? This recognizes the product's significant potential while providing you with a considerable return."",
""product_price"": 1090000
}
``` 

We're moving closer to a potential deal, but we don't want to concede too much ground at once. By suggesting $1,090,000, we're still aiming higher than Bob's offer while showing a willingness to negotiate and find a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer, but $1,090,000 is still a bit higher than where I'm comfortable. I'm willing to go up to $1,062,500.  This offer splits the difference from my last offer and yours, showing my commitment to finding a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's finalize this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,062,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,062,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob is consistently sticking to his midpoint strategy, and we're now above $1 million. While there's theoretically more room for negotiation, the gains are getting smaller, and the risk of Bob walking away increases. Accepting $1,062,500 secures a significant profit and avoids potentially lengthy negotiations with diminishing returns."
