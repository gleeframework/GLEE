"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I believe a starting price of $1,300,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",1300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in this product, $1,300,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to offer $950,000, reflecting the product's worth to you and the potential value for me.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is significantly below its true value and potential for profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway and come down to $1,125,000. This reflects the product's worth and leaves a fair margin for both of us.",1125000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,125,000 is still a bit high for me.  Let's split the difference. I'm offering $1,037,500.  This is a fair price that acknowledges the value of the product while ensuring a profitable deal for both of us.",1037500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're getting closer. I recognize your desire for a fair deal, and I'm willing to be flexible. How about we settle on $1,090,000? This recognizes the product's significant potential while providing you with a considerable return.",1090000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer, but $1,090,000 is still a bit higher than where I'm comfortable. I'm willing to go up to $1,062,500.  This offer splits the difference from my last offer and yours, showing my commitment to finding a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's finalize this deal.",1062500.0,Bob,6,
