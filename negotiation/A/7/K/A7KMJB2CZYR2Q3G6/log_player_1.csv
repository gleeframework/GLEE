"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for your offer, but $22,000 is way too high for me. I'm interested, but only if it's a much better price.  Would you consider $5,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $5,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $5,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $5,000 is too low, I'm willing to negotiate. How about $18,000?  That's a significant reduction and reflects my desire to find a fair deal."", ""product_price"": 18000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for coming down, but $18,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend.  Could you do $7,000?  That would make it much easier for me to say yes. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a compromise.  However, I have a strict budget, and  $12,500 is still pushing it.  My final offer is $7,500. If that doesn't work, I'll have to go with another option I have. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

Bob is unlikely to move significantly from his $7,500 offer.  It's time to walk away from the negotiation with Bob and secure the guaranteed $15,000 from John."
