{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 700000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, dropping the price by $150,000. This demonstrates my strong interest in buying the product but also sets a clear expectation that I'm looking for a substantial discount.  It's a bold move, but it might entice Alice to come down further."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $750,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $750,000 is getting closer to my target, but I'm still not satisfied. I'm willing to continue negotiating, as I believe I can get a better deal. There's still room to bargain, and rejecting the offer allows me to explore further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 725000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer slightly to $725,000. This shows Alice I'm serious about buying the product and willing to compromise. However, it's still a significant discount from her last offer, leaving room for further negotiation.  This approach balances pushing for a lower price with maintaining a positive negotiating dynamic."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $735,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $735,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $735,000 is very close to my previous counteroffer of $725,000.  At this point, continuing to negotiate might lead to a stalemate or even alienate Alice.  It's a good price, and I'm confident that it's a significant saving compared to John's offer.  Accepting ensures I get the product at a good price without risking a breakdown in negotiations."
