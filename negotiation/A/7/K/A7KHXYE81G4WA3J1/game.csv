"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested but $1,100,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $850,000?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $850,000 is lower than I'd hoped for, I'm willing to negotiate further. How about we split the difference and go with $975,000? This would be a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know your thoughts.",975000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $975,000 is closer, but still a little too high for my budget. Could you do $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $900,000 is still a bit below my minimum price.  I'm willing to go down to $950,000.  This would be a fair compromise, and I believe the value of the product justifies this price.  Please let me know if you're able to accept this offer.",950000.0,Alice,5,
