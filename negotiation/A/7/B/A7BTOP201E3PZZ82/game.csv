"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product, $14,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $11,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",11000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $11,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $13,000. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $13,000 is still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference at $12,500?  I'm really interested in this product, and I think this price is fair for both of us.",12500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $12,500. I'm willing to go a bit higher, but I'll give you a slight discount at $13,200. It's the best I can do for now.",13200.0,Alice,5,
