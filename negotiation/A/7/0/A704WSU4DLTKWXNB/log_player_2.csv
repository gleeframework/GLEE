"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a fantastic deal, and I'm confident you'll find it to be a valuable asset. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high.  It's better to try and negotiate a lower price.  There's still plenty of room to bargain before having to resort to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your product is interesting, but $1,000,000 is more than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $850,000.  This is a fair price, considering the value I place on the product. Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. While $850,000 is a step in the right direction, it's still a bit below my desired price point. I'm willing to come down to $950,000, recognizing your value assessment. This is a fair compromise that allows us both to benefit from this transaction. Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to my desired price, I'm still not ready to accept it.  There's still room to negotiate further, and I'm confident I can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  $950,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $900,000. I believe this price is fair considering the value we both place on the product.  I'm confident we can find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to negotiate a good price, and I appreciate your persistence. However, $900,000 is still below what I need to make this deal worthwhile.  I'm willing to come down to $925,000. This is a final offer, and it reflects the value I place on the product. Let's finalize this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's final offer of $925,000 is still above my ideal price, but it's getting closer to my maximum budget.  I'm not sure if I can negotiate further and get a better deal, and with only 5 rounds left, there's a risk of Alice walking away.  It's better to accept this offer than to risk losing the product and having to buy it from John for $800,000."
