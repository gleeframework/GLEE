"Alice, your product is interesting, but $1,000,000 is more than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $850,000.  This is a fair price, considering the value I place on the product. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. While $850,000 is a step in the right direction, it's still a bit below my desired price point. I'm willing to come down to $950,000, recognizing your value assessment. This is a fair compromise that allows us both to benefit from this transaction. Let me know if you're interested.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice,  $950,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $900,000. I believe this price is fair considering the value we both place on the product.  I'm confident we can find a solution that works for both of us.",900000.0,Bob,4,
