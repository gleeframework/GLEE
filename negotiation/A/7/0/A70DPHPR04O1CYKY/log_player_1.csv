Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a possible offer, considering Alice's goals:

```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it would be incredibly valuable to you, and I'm offering it at a price of $11,500. This is a unique opportunity to acquire something truly special."", 
""product_price"": 11500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Alice knows Bob values the product at $12,000.  Offering it at $11,500 allows Alice to capture a significant portion of the value difference while still leaving Bob with a perceived gain ($500).
* **Avoid Leaving Money on the Table:** If Alice asks for the full $12,000, Bob might try to negotiate, or worse, walk away entirely. 
* **John as a Safety Net:**  Knowing John will buy the product for $10,000 gives Alice a strong fallback position. She doesn't need to desperately sell to Bob. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Negotiating Style:** This offer assumes Bob is somewhat price-sensitive. If Alice knows Bob is very eager or less likely to negotiate, she might push the price closer to $12,000.
* **Relationship Building:** If Alice wants to establish a long-term relationship with Bob, she might consider a slightly lower price. This could lead to future business opportunities."
