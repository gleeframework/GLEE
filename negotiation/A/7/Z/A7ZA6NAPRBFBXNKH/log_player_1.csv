"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. I know its value to you, and I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  My starting offer is $2,000,000. Let's discuss!"", ""product_price"": 2000000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product is high to you, but my budget is limited. I would like to propose an offer of $1,200,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While $1,200,000 is tempting, it's still below my minimum threshold of $1,500,000. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob to see if we can reach a more favorable price, but I'll keep the option of selling to John open if the negotiations don't go my way."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer. While it's closer to what I'm looking for, it's still a bit too low.  Let's bridge the gap. I'm willing to come down to $1,750,000.  This reflects the product's true value and leaves room for both of us to walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 1750000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to counter with an offer of $1,500,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000

Bob's offer of $1,500,000 meets my minimum threshold and is the best I can get at this point. It's time to close the deal!"
