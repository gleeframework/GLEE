"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $13,500 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $10,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $11,500?  I'm confident this product will be worth every penny to you.",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $11,500 is closer, but still a little high for my budget. Would you be willing to do $10,800?",10800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have a budget, but I'm still not comfortable going that low. Let's try $11,200.  I'm willing to make a little more ground here, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for this product.",11200.0,Alice,5,
