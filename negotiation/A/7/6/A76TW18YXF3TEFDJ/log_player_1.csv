Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

This offer is significantly higher than my minimum price of $8,000, but leaves room for negotiation. It also shows that I'm serious about selling the product to Bob, but am confident in its value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,000 is a decent price, I'm aiming for a higher profit margin.  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to continue negotiating and potentially reach a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

This counteroffer is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer. It shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate while still securing a profit above my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $9,500 is close enough to my desired price point that accepting it is the best course of action. While I could potentially negotiate further, there's a risk that Bob will reject any future counteroffers and I'll be forced to sell to John for a significantly lower price."
