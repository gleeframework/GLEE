I'm starting with a price slightly higher than what the product is worth to Bob, hoping to get a good starting point for negotiation.  I'm confident I can get a better deal than selling to John for $8,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I believe I can still negotiate a better deal. I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can meet in the middle."
