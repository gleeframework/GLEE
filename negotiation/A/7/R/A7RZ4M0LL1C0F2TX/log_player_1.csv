Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $8,500.  Let's see if we can make a deal.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference at $9,250? It's a fair price that leaves us both with some room to be happy. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9250}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $9,250 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $9,000. This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away with a good deal.  What do you say?

Round 6
