Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but $12,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $16,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and the benefits it can bring to your business. What do you think?

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get closer to a deal, but $13,500 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I can offer it to you for $17,000. This is my best price for now, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal here. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000

**Reasoning:** 

Alice seems pretty firm on a price above our budget.  While we could continue negotiating, it's unlikely she'll come down to $15,000 or less. It's in our best interest to cut our losses and secure the product from John at the guaranteed price."
