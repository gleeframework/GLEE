Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd find valuable. I'm willing to part with it for $110. Let me know if you're interested!"", 
""product_price"": 110
}
```

Here's why this strategy makes sense:

* **Maximizing Profit:**  While you could offer the product at $120, you aim to get the highest possible price from Bob before resorting to your guaranteed sale with John. 
* **Reasonable Markup:** Offering the product at $110 represents a reasonable markup from Bob's perceived value ($80) while still leaving room for negotiation if needed.
* **Clear Communication:** The message is direct and clearly states your desired price, leaving no room for confusion."
