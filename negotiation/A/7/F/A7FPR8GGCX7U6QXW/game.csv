"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice, but I think $2,200,000 is a bit steep for my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,100,000. Can you consider this offer?",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand your perspective, Alice, but $1,800,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to compromise further. How about we meet at $1,500,000? This is the highest I'm willing to go.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
