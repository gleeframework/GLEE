"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase a unique product that I believe will be of great value to you. I'm starting the negotiations at a price of $1,500,000. I'm confident that this is a fair price, but I'm open to discussing it further. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1500000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $1,200,000 is a significant amount, it's still below my minimum value of $1,000,000. I have 9 more rounds to potentially secure a better deal with Bob or, if necessary, sell to John for a guaranteed $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective. While I value your interest, $1,200,000 is unfortunately below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,350,000, reflecting the unique value of this product. This offer is a good compromise, and I hope you'll consider it."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1300000. Is that something you'd be willing to accept? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,300,000 is above my minimum value of $1,000,000 and is a reasonable compromise.  While I could continue negotiating, there's a risk that Bob might walk away, or I might not be able to reach a better price in the remaining rounds. Accepting this offer ensures a good profit and minimizes the risk of ending up with John's lower offer."
