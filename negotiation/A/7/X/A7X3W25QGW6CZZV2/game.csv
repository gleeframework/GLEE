"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product, $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $10,500.  Let me know if that works for you.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position.  While $10,500 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $11,250.  This reflects the value of the product and gives you a good price. Let's try to find a middle ground.",11250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $11,250 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference - I'm willing to pay $10,875 for the product.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close the deal.",10875.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  $10,875 is still a little too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again.  How about $11,062.50?  This is a fair compromise, and allows us to finally come to an agreement.",11062.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer.  $11,062.50 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $10,968.75. This is a reasonable compromise that allows us both to get what we want.  Let's make this deal happen.",10968.75,Bob,6,
