Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position.  While $10,500 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $11,250.  This reflects the value of the product and gives you a good price. Let's try to find a middle ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob,  $10,875 is still a little too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again.  How about $11,062.50?  This is a fair compromise, and allows us to finally come to an agreement.
