Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at the special price of $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", 
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $120, your goal is to see if you can get more from Bob.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** While you don't want to go below $120, starting with a price slightly lower than John's offer might pique Bob's interest. This also allows room for Bob to potentially negotiate up if he's really interested. 
* **Create Urgency:** The phrase ""limited time offer"" might encourage Bob to make a decision quicker. 

It's important to remember that Bob might still reject the offer, but this strategy gives you the best chance to maximize your potential earnings."
