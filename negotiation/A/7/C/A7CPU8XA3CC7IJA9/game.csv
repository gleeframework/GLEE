"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the negotiation effort. However, given my budget constraints, I am only willing to pay up to $10,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for the counteroffer.  While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $10,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $11,500. This is still a significant discount for you, and it's the best I can do at this time. Let me know what you think!",11500.0,Alice,3,
