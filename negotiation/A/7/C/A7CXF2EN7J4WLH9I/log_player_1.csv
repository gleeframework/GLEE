Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you. I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $1,500,000, you start the negotiation significantly higher than Bob's perceived value. 
* **Justification:** The message hints at the product's value and other potential buyers to justify the high price without explicitly revealing your guaranteed offer. 
* **Urgency and scarcity:**  The ""limited-time offer"" and mentioning ""other interested parties"" create a sense of urgency and scarcity, potentially pushing Bob to make a decision quickly.
* **Room for negotiation:** While the initial price is high, it leaves some room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer. 

This strategy aims to maximize your profit while still providing an offer that Bob might consider, given the perceived value and potential of the product."
