"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $25,000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 25000}
``` 

I'm starting with a relatively high price, knowing it's unlikely Bob will accept it on the first round. This allows me to gauge his interest and start the negotiation process. I've left room for negotiation but still kept the price above my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $18000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $18,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm not ready to accept it yet. I want to see if I can push for a higher price. I'll counter with a slightly lower price than my initial offer, aiming for a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. $18,000 is a good starting point, but I'm hoping for a bit more to reflect the value I'm offering. How about $22,000? I'm open to discussing further if this isn't suitable."", ""product_price"": 22000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $22000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $19000. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $19,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $19,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

$19,000 is a good compromise. It's above my minimum and shows that Bob is willing to negotiate.  While I could try for a higher price, it's getting closer to the midpoint and I don't want to risk losing the deal completely."
