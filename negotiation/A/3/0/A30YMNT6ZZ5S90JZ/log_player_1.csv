Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer of $10,000. This is a good starting point because it leaves room for negotiation if Bob is interested but wants a lower price. If he rejects, I can still work my way down while keeping in mind my minimum acceptable price of $8,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
I'm accepting Bob's offer. While it's not my ideal price, it's still above my minimum acceptable price of $8,000 and close enough to my initial offer that it's worth accepting to avoid further negotiation."
