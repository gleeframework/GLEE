"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $10000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $8500 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
The product is worth at least $8,000 to Alice, and Bob's offer is only $500 above that. Alice can likely get a better deal by continuing the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,250. This reflects the value of the product and gives you a good price. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 9250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that you're willing to come down to $9250, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to pay $8750 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice has already lowered her price significantly, and Bob is still not willing to meet her in the middle. It's worth trying one more counteroffer to see if Bob will budge. There are still several rounds left, and Alice could potentially get closer to her desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm seeing your commitment to this product, and I want to make this work. Let's split the difference - I'll accept $9,000 for the product.  This is my final offer, let me know your decision."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with $9000. I'm willing to pay $8800 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Alice has been persistent in her negotiations, but Bob is not willing to budge much further.  The difference between their offers is narrowing, but Alice is running out of time. With only 4 rounds left, it's highly unlikely that she can get a significantly better offer from Bob.  Selling to John at $8,000 is the most sensible choice, as it guarantees her a minimum profit and avoids the risk of a further price reduction."
