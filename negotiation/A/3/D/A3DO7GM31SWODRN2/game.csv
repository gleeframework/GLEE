"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this excellent product. I think it would be incredibly beneficial to you. Given its value and the benefits it offers, I'm asking for $22,000. What do you think?",22000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $22,000 is way too high for my budget. This product would be valuable to me, but I'm only willing to pay a price that reflects its actual worth. How about $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer. I understand your perspective on the price.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $10,000 is significantly below its true value.  How about we meet halfway at $16,000? This reflects the value it brings while still being a fair deal for you.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. However, $16,000 is still a bit too steep for me.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $12,000.  I believe this is a fair offer that reflects the value I place on the product.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, and I understand you're looking for a deal.  How about we split the difference again and settle on $14,000? This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the product's value.",14000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer, but $14,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go.  How about we settle at $12,500?  I'm hoping we can find an agreement on this price.",12500.0,Bob,6,
