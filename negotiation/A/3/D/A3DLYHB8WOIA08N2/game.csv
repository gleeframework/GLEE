"Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900,000. This is a fair price considering its worth to you.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. While I appreciate the opportunity, $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product. This is a fair price given its value to you and allows me to stay within my budget.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $850,000. This is still a great deal considering its value to you, and I'm confident you'll see the benefits of acquiring it.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $850,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to offer $800,000 for the product, which is a fair price considering your value for it. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",800000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $800,000. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll sell the product to you for $825,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the value it holds for me.",825000.0,Alice,5,
