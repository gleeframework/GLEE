"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900,000. This is a fair price considering its worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $900,000 is still above my target price of $1,200,000. It's too early to buy from John, as I can try to negotiate a better price with Alice.  Rejecting the offer allows me to make a counteroffer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. While I appreciate the opportunity, $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product. This is a fair price given its value to you and allows me to stay within my budget."", ""product_price"": 750000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $850,000. This is still a great deal considering its value to you, and I'm confident you'll see the benefits of acquiring it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $850,000 is closer to my target, it's still above my desired price point. I'm going to reject this offer and try to negotiate further with Alice. There are still several rounds remaining, and I can try to bring the price down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $850,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to offer $800,000 for the product, which is a fair price considering your value for it. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $800,000. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll sell the product to you for $825,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the value it holds for me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price to $825,000. This is still above my target of $1,200,000, but it's getting closer.  With only a few rounds remaining, and given John's price of $1,200,000, it makes sense to accept this offer.  Accepting secures the product and saves me a significant amount of money compared to buying from John."
