"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $9,500. I believe it will be highly valuable to you, and this price reflects its worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $9,500 is better than $10,000, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting Alice's offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, I'm looking to pay a bit less. I'd be willing to purchase the product for $8,500.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $8,500 is too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is now $9,000.** This is a good price for Bob, considering his maximum budget is $10,000. 
* **There's a risk of further negotiation.** If Bob rejects this offer, Alice might be unwilling to drop the price further, or the negotiation could drag on.
* **Buying from John is more expensive.**  While John is willing to sell for $10,000, Bob can get the same product for $9,000 from Alice.

**Therefore, it's in Bob's best interest to accept Alice's offer and secure the product for $9,000.**"
