"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000.  This is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  Here's why:

* **Potential for a better deal:**  Bob knows the product is worth $800,000 to Alice.  There's room for negotiation to get a lower price.
* **Alternative option:** Bob has a backup option with John, but it's significantly more expensive.  Negotiating with Alice makes more sense. 
 
By rejecting Alice's offer, Bob can counter with a lower price and potentially secure a more favorable deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product.  This price is fair considering your value for it and my budget.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $900,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000, recognizing your budget constraints.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob should accept Alice's offer. Here's why:

* **Good price:**  $950,000 is a good price for Bob, considering his maximum budget of $1,200,000.
* **Risk of further negotiation:**  Continuing to negotiate might result in Alice getting closer to her desired price, making it less favorable for Bob. 
* **Alternative is more expensive:**  Buying from John for $1,200,000 would cost significantly more.

Therefore, accepting Alice's offer at $950,000 is the best course of action for Bob in this situation."
