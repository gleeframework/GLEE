"Bob, thanks for your interest and counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the price, but the product's value is truly significant. How about we settle at $1,650,000? This reflects some movement on my end while still recognizing the product's worth.",1650000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate the movement, but I'm still not convinced that $1,650,000 is the right price. I'm willing to meet you at $1,450,000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go.",1450000.0,Bob,4,
