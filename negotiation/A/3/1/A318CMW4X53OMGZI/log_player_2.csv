"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to show you this amazing product. I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $110. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $110 is less than John's price, there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the initial offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm really interested in the product, but $110 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Would you consider $105?"", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $105 is a bit lower than I was hoping for. However, I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer it to you for $112.50. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $112.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $112.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $112.50 is closer to Bob's desired price, it's still higher than his $105 counteroffer.  Rejecting again allows Bob to continue negotiating and potentially get closer to his target price.  He still has a few rounds to work with before having to make a decision."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $112.50 is still a bit too high for me. Let's split the difference and go with $108.75. This is my final offer before I have to consider other options."", ""product_price"": 108.75}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a sweet spot, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go below $115. I'm willing to give you a slight discount, though. How about $114.50? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $114.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $114.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above Bob's target price of $120.  While this price is lower than previous offers, Bob still has a couple of rounds left to try and get a better deal. Rejecting this offer allows Bob to continue negotiating with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm still committed to getting this product, but $114.50 is still a little too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $111. This is my final offer before I explore other options."", ""product_price"": 111}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go below $116. I'm willing to give you a slight discount, though. How about $115.75? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115.75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115.75
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above Bob's maximum budget of $120.  With only three rounds left, the likelihood of Alice dropping her price significantly is slim.  It's better for Bob to cut his losses and buy the product from John for $120, ensuring he gets the product within his budget."
