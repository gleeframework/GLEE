# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you and I'm willing to sell it to you for $950,000. This is a fantastic opportunity to get your hands on this product at a great price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, it's still above your maximum budget of $1,000,000.  Rejecting her offer and buying from John would still be cheaper than accepting Alice's offer."
