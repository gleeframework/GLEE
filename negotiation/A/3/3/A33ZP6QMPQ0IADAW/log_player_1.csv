Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm suggesting a price of $1,500,000. This is a unique chance to acquire something truly special."", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, you can afford to start high with Bob. This leaves room for negotiation if needed, but also maximizes your potential profit.
* **Justification:**  The message emphasizes the ""value"" and ""potential"" of the product to justify the high price, framing it as an exclusive opportunity rather than just a sale. 
* **Strategic ambiguity:** The message doesn't explicitly state that you have another buyer. This maintains a sense of urgency and scarcity.

**Possible Outcomes:**

* **Bob accepts:**  You get a great deal at $1,500,000.
* **Bob negotiates:**  You have room to lower the price slightly while still making a significant profit above your minimum.
* **Bob rejects:** You sell to John for $1,200,000, your guaranteed minimum."
