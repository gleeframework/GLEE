"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $17,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product. I believe that's a fair price considering its value to me.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $15,500, which is still a good deal for you considering the product's value.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",15500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you're trying to find a fair price, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we split the difference and settle at $14,000?  That seems like a reasonable compromise.",14000.0,Bob,4,
