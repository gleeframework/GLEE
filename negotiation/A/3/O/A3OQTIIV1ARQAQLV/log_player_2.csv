"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I think you'll find it's a great fit for your needs and I'm confident you'll be happy with the investment. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Here's how to break down the decision:

* **Your Maximum:** You're willing to pay up to $1,200,000.
* **Alice's Offer:** $900,000
* **John's Offer:** $1,200,000

Since Alice's offer is lower than your maximum price AND lower than John's offer, it makes sense to accept.
