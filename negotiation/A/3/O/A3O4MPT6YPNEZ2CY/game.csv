"Alice, thanks for the offer, but I'm looking to spend a bit less. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value we both see in it. Let's work towards a deal!",1250000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,250,000 undervalues the product significantly.  I'm confident that its true worth is closer to my initial offer. How about we meet in the middle at $1,325,000?",1325000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,325,000 is still a bit high for me.  Let's split the difference and go with $1,300,000.  I'm confident we can both walk away happy with this deal.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
