"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am looking to keep my investment within $8,000. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your budget constraints, but $10,000 is significantly below its value.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,000? This offer reflects the true worth of the product while still giving you a fair deal.",13000.0,Alice,3,
