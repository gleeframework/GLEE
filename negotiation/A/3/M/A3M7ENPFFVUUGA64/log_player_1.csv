Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on this product. I think you'll find it's worth the price of $119."", ""product_price"": 119}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  My goal is to get as close to $120 as possible.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $100, so offering it slightly below my minimum ($120) won't work.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While I'm aiming high, starting at $119 leaves a tiny bit of wiggle room if Bob tries to negotiate down slightly. 
* **John as Backup:**  I have a guaranteed sale at $120 from John, so there's no pressure to go below that. 

This strategy balances maximizing profit with the risk of Bob rejecting the offer."
