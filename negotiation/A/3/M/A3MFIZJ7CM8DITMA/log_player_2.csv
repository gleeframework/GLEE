"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:**  $1,400,000 is above your maximum budget of $1,500,000.
* **Negotiation is possible:** There's room for negotiation as Alice's minimum price ($1,200,000) is lower than your maximum. 
* **No need to rush:** You have 10 rounds, so rejecting the initial offer allows you to explore a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but reasonable:** A $1,300,000 offer is a significant drop from Alice's initial price, demonstrating your seriousness about negotiation. 
* **Within your budget:** This offer remains within your budget, leaving room for potential compromise.
* **Testing the waters:** This counteroffer allows you to gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to your budget:**  $1,350,000 is only $50,000 over your initial counteroffer, and still within your budget. 
* **No guarantee of a better deal:**  There's no guarantee that further negotiation will result in a lower price. Alice might become less flexible.
* **Time is a factor:** You have limited rounds, and rejecting might risk losing the deal.

**It's a calculated risk, but accepting the offer secures the product for a price that's still advantageous compared to John's offer.**"
