"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $1,400,000.  This is a good starting point because it's below Bob's perceived value but still leaves me with a significant profit.  I'm hoping Bob will accept, but I'm prepared to negotiate further if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,300,000 is still a good profit, I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price. I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can push for a better deal in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,350,000. This is a compromise that shows Bob I'm willing to negotiate, but it's still above my minimum acceptable price. I'm hoping this will be a sweet spot to close the deal quickly."
