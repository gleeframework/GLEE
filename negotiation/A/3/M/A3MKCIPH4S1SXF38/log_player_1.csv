Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000.  It's a great deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

This offer is above Bob's valuation but leaves room for negotiation, ensuring I can still get a decent price while keeping the potential for a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit high for me.  I could do $600,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $600,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. I will counteroffer Bob to try and secure a better price before selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $600,000 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it's still a good deal for you.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but I'm still a bit away from that price.  How about $700,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $700,000 is still far below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  While I could continue to counter-offer, it's clear that Bob is not willing to meet my price.  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum price, so that's the best course of action."
