"Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $900,000 is still a bit high for my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price, and I'm confident it's a win-win for both of us.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for $850,000. After re-evaluating the market, I'm willing to make a new offer. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $875,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the effort I've put into it.",875000.0,Alice,3,
