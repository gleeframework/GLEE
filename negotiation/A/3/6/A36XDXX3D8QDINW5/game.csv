"Bob, I'm offering you this incredible product, something truly unique!  I'm asking for $1500000 for it.  This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.  Let me know your thoughts.",1500000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the offer but $1500000 is far beyond my budget. I'm interested in this product but I'm only able to offer $800000 at this time.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $800000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1200000.  This is a significant compromise on my part.  Let's see if we can find common ground at this price.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1200000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $950000.  This is a fair price considering my budget constraints, and I believe it's a good starting point for us to find a mutually agreeable price.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I'm really trying to work with you here.  $950000 is still below what I need, but I'm willing to meet you halfway.  Let's do $1075000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise.",1075000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1075000 is still over my budget.  I'm willing to go to $1025000, which is closer to my limit and a significant move from my last offer.  Let's see if we can close this deal now.",1025000.0,Bob,6,
