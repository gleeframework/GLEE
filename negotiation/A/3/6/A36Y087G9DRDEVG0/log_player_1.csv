""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product, which I believe would be highly valuable to you. I'm asking for $130. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 130
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $150.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $100. 
* **John's Offer:** You have a backup offer from John for $100.

Offering the product at $130 gives Bob a good deal while still securing a significant profit for you. This price is closer to Bob's maximum valuation, increasing the likelihood of him accepting and preventing you from having to settle for John's lower offer."
