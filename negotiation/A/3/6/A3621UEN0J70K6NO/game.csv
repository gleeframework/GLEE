"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm afraid $1050000 is a bit below my minimum. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though.

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, $1150000 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but this time I'll give you a bit more room to maneuver. I can offer it to you for $1225000. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's value, and I'm confident you'll see the benefits of owning it.",1225000.0,Alice,5,

I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target. I can offer it to you for $1200000, but I need to make it clear that this is my final offer.
