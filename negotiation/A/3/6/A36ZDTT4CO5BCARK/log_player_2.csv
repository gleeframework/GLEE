You have three options:

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $110 might be a bit high for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $90. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy it!

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $75 is a good compromise, but I'm not willing to go that low just yet. I'm willing to meet you at $85, which is still a great deal for you. It's the lowest I can go, but I think it's a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json

```

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go any lower than $85.  Since you have the option to buy from John for $80, it's in your best interest to take the guaranteed lower price."
