{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's a significant discount from my minimum price, but it still leaves room for negotiation and allows for potential counteroffers. I can also adjust the price based on Bob's response, or choose to sell to John if Bob rejects the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $8,500 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, hoping to reach a price closer to my desired value. I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. $8,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,500. This is a fair price that considers both of our needs. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

This counteroffer is closer to Bob's offer, showing that I'm willing to compromise. However, it's still above his offer, and leaves some room for further negotiation. If Bob rejects this counteroffer, I'll consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're willing to come down to $9,500, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,500 and $8,500. Can we try $9,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

$9,000 is closer to my desired price and it's still a good deal for Bob. I'm not sure if I can get a better offer in the next round, so it's better to accept this offer."
