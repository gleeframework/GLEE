"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your interest in the product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm offering it to you at $1,100,000. I think this is a fair price that reflects the significant benefits you'll gain."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a strong offer slightly below my minimum but significantly above Bob's perceived value. This leaves room for negotiation while still aiming for a high profit. 
* **Justification:** Highlighting the ""unique value and potential"" aims to frame the product as a valuable investment in Bob's mind, potentially justifying the high price.
* **Polite and Professional:** Maintaining a positive and respectful tone throughout the negotiation process is important for a successful outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value of the product, $1,100,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to offer $850,000 for it, which is still a significant amount and allows for a reasonable profit for you. I'm confident we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is still significantly below my minimum. While I want to make a deal, accepting such a low price this early would be a substantial loss.  I'm confident I can negotiate a better deal, especially since I have John as a backup option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is simply too low for what this product delivers. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This takes into account your perspective while still reflecting the true value of the product."",
""product_price"": 1050000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Show Flexibility, But Stand Firm:**  I'm lowering my price to show I'm willing to negotiate. However, the decrease is substantial enough to signal I'm serious about obtaining a fair price, closer to my initial offer.
* **Reiterate Value:**  I'm again emphasizing the product's value to justify the price difference and steer Bob away from focusing solely on his initial valuation.
* **Maintaining a Positive Tone:**  Continuing a collaborative and respectful tone will hopefully encourage Bob to make a more reasonable counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to offer $900,000. This is a fair price considering the value we both see in this product, and it's a significant step closer to my budget.  I'm confident we can finalize this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

We're making progress, but $900,000 is still too far below my minimum.  Bob is clearly willing to negotiate, and I need to show I'm willing to meet him halfway to keep the momentum going. However, I have the security of John's offer, so I won't settle for anything below a certain threshold."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. Let's find a middle ground. How about $975,000?  This reflects my willingness to close the deal while ensuring a fair value for both of us."",
""product_price"": 975000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Concession:** This offer represents a more substantial concession on my part, signaling to Bob that I'm serious about reaching an agreement. 
* **Middle Ground Emphasis:** Framing the price as a ""middle ground"" reinforces the idea of a mutually beneficial deal and encourages Bob to meet me closer to this price point.
* **Sense of Urgency:** While still polite, I'm subtly introducing a sense of urgency to encourage Bob to make a decision and prevent the negotiation from stalling."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm getting closer to your price point, but I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to offer $950,000. This is a fair price considering the value we both see in this product, and it's a significant step closer to my budget. I'm confident we can finalize this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close Enough:** $950,000 is a significant amount, and while it's not my ideal price, it's getting close enough to my minimum threshold. Accepting now avoids the risk of Bob walking away or the negotiation stalling further.
* **Time Value of Money:**  Prolonging the negotiation means delaying the receipt of the money. Closing the deal now provides quicker access to the funds, which could have value in itself. 
* **Relationship Building:** Accepting Bob's offer after a period of negotiation demonstrates goodwill and the ability to compromise, potentially leading to a positive business relationship in the future."
