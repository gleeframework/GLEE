"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product. I'm happy to offer it to you for $140. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is above your maximum budget of $120.**
* **You have 10 rounds to negotiate and can still get the product from John for $120.** This makes it worth attempting to negotiate a lower price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I'm interested,  $140 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'd be willing to pay $125 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 125}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting point:**  This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial price, but it's still within the realm of a potential deal. 
* **Negotiation tactic:**  A substantial counteroffer early on signals to Alice that you're serious about getting a good price. 
* **John's offer:**  Remember, John is your backup option for $120, so there's room to negotiate further if necessary."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $125 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $135. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still above your maximum budget of $120.**
* **You have 7 rounds left to negotiate.**  Since you can always buy from John for $120, it's worth continuing to negotiate with Alice to try to get a better price. 
* **Negotiation strategy:** Rejecting Alice's offer keeps the pressure on her to come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $135 is still a bit high for me.  I'm firm on $125. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm really interested in this product.  Let's try to close the deal."", ""product_price"": 125}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Stand your ground:** You've already established your maximum price of $125, and sticking to it shows Alice that you're serious.
* **Reiterate interest:**  Mentioning your interest in the product helps build a sense of urgency and encourages Alice to compromise.
* **Fairness:**  Frame your counteroffer as a fair price for both sides. This can help make your position seem more reasonable."
