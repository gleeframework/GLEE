# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I think you'll love it, and I'm willing to let it go for a price that I think is very reasonable. I'm offering it to you for $900,000. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better offer elsewhere. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000.

``` 

While Alice's offer of $900,000 is under your $1,000,000 limit, you can try to get a better price. By rejecting this offer, you can see if she'll come down further.  If her next offer is still too high, you can always buy from John for $1,000,000."
