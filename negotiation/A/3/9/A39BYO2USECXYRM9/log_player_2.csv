# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I believe a price of $925,000 is fair. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While it's lower than John's price, there's still room for negotiation to get a better deal."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective on the price.  While $850,000 is a respectable offer, the true value of this product is significantly higher. I'm willing to meet you halfway - how about we settle at $887,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $887,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $887,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob should accept Alice's offer. $887,500 is a good price for him, as it's significantly lower than John's price and still leaves some room for Alice to make a profit.  There's no guarantee that further negotiation will yield a lower price, and it's likely that Alice won't budge much more."
