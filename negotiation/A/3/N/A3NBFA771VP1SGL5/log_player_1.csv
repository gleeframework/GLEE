Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a unique product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. I've researched your needs and I'm confident this will exceed your expectations. I'm willing to part with it for $1,400,000."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as much money as possible from Bob before resorting to John's guaranteed $1,000,000 offer.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Since Bob values the product at $1,500,000, there's room to negotiate a price higher than John's offer.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $1,400,000 leaves Bob with a potential profit of $100,000 if he accepts. This is a strong incentive for him while still securing a significant profit for you. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Negotiation Skills:** This strategy assumes Bob is rational and primarily motivated by profit. A highly skilled negotiator might try to push the price lower.
* **Relationship Building:**  Depending on your long-term goals, building goodwill with Bob might be a consideration. A slightly lower price could foster a positive future relationship."
