"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $130. I think it's a fair price considering its value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Reason:  While $130 is a decent price, Bob can likely get a better deal by counteroffering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice, but I'm looking to spend a bit less.  How about $115? I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 115}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your offer, Bob, but $115 is a bit too low for me. Could you do $125? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Reason: Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible, and $125 is still higher than his ideal price. There's still room for negotiation, so rejecting and counteroffering is the best course of action."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $125 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $120, which is a fair compromise, I believe. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
