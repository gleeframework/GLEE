"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. My initial offer is $950,000 for the product.",950000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $950,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $850,000.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thank you for your counteroffer of $850,000. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm afraid I need to make a bit more than that to make it worth my while. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $900,000 for it. Can we discuss further?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $900,000 is still a stretch for me. I'm willing to go up to $875,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close the deal.",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $875,000 is still a bit short of what I'm looking for. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $875,000 and $900,000, which would be $887,500. Can we meet at this price?",887500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm happy we're getting closer. However, $887,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $880,000.  This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can close the deal at this price. What do you say?",880000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm glad we're getting close to a deal. However, $880,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to make one more concession and meet you at $885,000. This is the lowest I can go, so I hope we can finalize the deal at this price.",885000.0,Alice,7,
