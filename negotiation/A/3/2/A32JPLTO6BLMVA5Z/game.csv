"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a high-quality item that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $90. This is a great deal, considering its value is worth at least $80 to me. What do you think?",90.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. I've done some research and I think that's a fair price for a product like this.",80.0,Bob,2,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your research. However, I'm not willing to sell it to you for $80. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $85. This is a fair price considering its value to me is at least $80. What do you think?",85.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to pay $85. I'm willing to pay $82.50 for the product. Can you consider that?",82.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to sell it to you for $82.50. I'm willing to make another concession and offer it to you for $84. This is my final offer. What do you think?",84.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your concession, Alice, but I'm still not willing to pay $84. I'm willing to go up to $83 for the product. That's the highest I'm willing to pay. Can you consider that?",83.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, Bob, but I'm not willing to sell it to you for $83. I've already made significant concessions, and I'm not willing to go any lower. I'm going to have to think about selling it to someone else. Would you like to make one final offer?",90.0,Alice,7,
