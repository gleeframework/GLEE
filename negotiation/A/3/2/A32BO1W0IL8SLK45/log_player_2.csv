"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,400,000 is fair. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer is higher than Bob's maximum budget of $1,500,000.
*  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price with Alice. 
* There are still 9 rounds left to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in the product, $1,400,000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Bob is trying to find a price that is acceptable to both him and Alice.
*  $1,300,000 is a significant discount from Alice's initial offer, but still leaves room for further negotiation.
* This counteroffer shows Bob is serious about buying the product but is also willing to walk away if the price is too high."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to come down slightly. How about we meet in the middle at $1,350,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still above Bob's ideal price point and leaves room for further negotiation. 
*  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue exploring a price closer to his $1,300,000 target.
*  With 7 rounds remaining, there's still time to find a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you being flexible. I'm still a bit higher than my target price. Let's try $1,325,000. It's a good compromise and I believe it's fair for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1325000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Bob is trying to inch closer to his desired price while still showing a willingness to compromise.
* Offering $1,325,000 is a smaller step down from Alice's offer, signaling that Bob is serious about closing the deal. 
* With 6 rounds remaining, there's still time for further negotiation but Bob needs to ensure the price doesn't climb too high."
