{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

Bob is trying to save as much money as possible. While $140 is a good price, Bob can likely get it for lower. He'll try to counter-offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $140 is a bit high for me. How about $130?  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 130}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about $135? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob is still aiming for a lower price. He's willing to go up a bit from his previous offer, but he'll try to counter again to see if he can get it for $130."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down, Alice.  $135 is still a little high for me.  Let's split the difference - how about $132.50?  I'm really interested in this product, and I think this price is fair."", ""product_price"": 132.50}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm not losing money on this deal. How about $134? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $134. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $134
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob has gotten Alice down to $134, which is a good price for him.  While he'd love to get it for $132.50, there's a risk she'll reject the counteroffer again.  He might not have enough rounds left to get a better price.  Accepting at $134 saves him money and gets him the product."
