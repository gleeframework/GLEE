{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your product is interesting, but $900,000 is out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 750000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $900,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to offer it to you for $850,000. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you'll love the product. What do you think?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $850,000 is getting closer to my budget, I'm still determined to get a better price. I'm not desperate to buy from Alice, and I have the option of buying from John for $800,000.  I'm going to keep negotiating with Alice to see if I can get her down even further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $850,000 is still above my limit.  I'm really interested in this product, and I'm willing to pay $825,000.  This is a fair price that allows us both to make a deal.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 825000}

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to offer it to you for $825,001. Just kidding! I'm actually willing to meet you at $835,000. This is a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $835,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $835,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $835,000 is tempting, it's still higher than what I'm willing to pay. I'm very close to my budget limit, but I believe I can still get a better deal by continuing to negotiate with Alice.  I'll counter her offer and see if I can convince her to come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm really appreciating your flexibility.  However, $835,000 is still a bit more than I can comfortably manage. I'm willing to pay $815,000, which is a very fair price for both of us.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 815000}

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal possible. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to meet you at $820,000. This is a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with the product. What do you think?

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $820,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is coming down in price, $820,000 is still a bit more than I want to pay.  I'm running out of rounds and I'm not sure I can get her down to my price point.  I've been able to get a lower price than her initial asking price, but it's time to go with the guaranteed deal with John at $800,000."
