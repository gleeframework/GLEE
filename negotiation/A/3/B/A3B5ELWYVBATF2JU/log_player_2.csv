Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $1,100,000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you a discount, but I need to make a profit. I'm thinking of a price of $1,300,000. This is my final offer for now, but I'm open to negotiations.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $1,300,000. However, I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal. I'll include a 5-year warranty and a dedicated support package, which will add significant value to the product. With these extras, I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,250,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

**Reasoning:**

* **Good Deal:** Alice has come down considerably and is offering the product for $1,250,000. This is a $250,000 savings from John's offer and a significant discount from her initial asking price.
* **Added Value:** The included 5-year warranty and dedicated support package add value to the deal, potentially offsetting future costs and making the offer even more attractive.
* **Negotiation Fatigue:**  While we could try to negotiate further, there's no guarantee Alice will go lower. Continuing to negotiate risks missing out on this already good deal. 

It's a good time to accept the offer and secure the product at a favorable price."
