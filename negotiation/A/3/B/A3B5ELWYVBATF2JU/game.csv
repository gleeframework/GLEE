"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to acquire this valuable product. I believe it's a game-changer for your business, and I'm willing to start with a competitive price of $1,400,000. What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product has potential, that price is a little high for me. I'd be willing to purchase it for $1,100,000.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1,100,000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you a discount, but I need to make a profit. I'm thinking of a price of $1,300,000. This is my final offer for now, but I'm open to negotiations.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for coming down a bit.  To be honest, $1,300,000 is still a stretch for me. How about we split the difference from our last offers and settle at $1,200,000?",1200000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $1,300,000. However, I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal. I'll include a 5-year warranty and a dedicated support package, which will add significant value to the product. With these extras, I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,250,000.
