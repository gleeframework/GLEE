"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product! I think it would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $115. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
You are willing to pay up to $120, and Alice's offer is $115.  It makes sense to try and negotiate a lower price before buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but $115 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. Would you be open to $105? "", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but I'm looking to get a bit closer to my asking price. How about we meet in the middle at $110? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You're still trying to get the best deal.  While $110 is better than $115, you can likely get it for less. It's worth trying to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  I'm still a bit high at $110, but I'm willing to go up to $108.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement!"", ""product_price"": 108}
