Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, considering its value to me.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than my minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and gives me some leverage.
* **Appealing to Value:** I'm framing the offer as a ""great deal"" to emphasize the potential benefit for Bob.
* **Open-ended Question:**  The open-ended question encourages Bob to respond and engage in negotiation. 

**Next Steps:**

* **If Bob accepts:**  Great! I've secured a sale.
* **If Bob rejects:**  I'll analyze his counteroffer and determine whether it's worth negotiating further or if I should move on to John's offer of $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:**  $9,000 is below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Potential for better deal:** While Bob's offer is closer to my desired range, I believe I can still negotiate a higher price. 
* **Leveraging John's offer:** I have a guaranteed buyer in John who is willing to pay $15,000. This gives me the confidence to hold out for a better price from Bob.

**Next Steps:**

* I will send a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my desired range while still being reasonable for him."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $9,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This price still reflects the value of the product and gives you a good deal.  Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing a willingness to compromise by coming down from my initial offer of $12,000.
* **Value Justification:**  I'm reiterating the value of the product to justify the price.
* **""Meet in the middle"" approach:** This phrase suggests a sense of fairness and encourages Bob to consider my offer as a reasonable middle ground.

**Next Steps:**

* **If Bob accepts:**  Excellent! I've secured a good price.
* **If Bob rejects:**  I will need to assess the situation. If Bob's counteroffer is too low, I'll sell to John for $15,000. If it's closer to my desired price, I'll continue negotiating."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Negotiation Stalemate:** Bob's offer of $9,500 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Time and Effort:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob would likely involve multiple rounds and require more time and effort.
* **Guaranteed Sale:**  John offers a guaranteed sale for $15,000. This eliminates the uncertainty and potential for further negotiation fatigue.

**Conclusion:**

While I would prefer to get closer to my ideal price, selling to John offers the best outcome considering the current situation.  It ensures a secure sale at a price that meets my minimum requirement."
