"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, it's a pleasure to connect with you. I'm confident this product would be a valuable asset to you. Given its potential, I'm offering it for $2,250,000."", 
""product_price"": 2250000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always beneficial to start negotiations with a higher price than your minimum. This gives you room to negotiate down while still aiming for a profit exceeding John's offer.
* **Strategic Positioning:** By opening at $2,250,000, we signal that we perceive the product's value to be significantly higher than Bob's perceived value. This can potentially lead him to counter with a higher offer than he initially planned. 
* **John as Leverage:** Having John as a backup buyer provides a strong safety net. If negotiations with Bob don't proceed favorably, we can walk away and still secure our desired minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the product's potential, $2,250,000 is outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,750,000, which is still a good deal for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,750,000 is a significant jump from his perceived value of $1,500,000. This indicates room for negotiation.  While selling to John is always an option, it makes sense to continue negotiating with Bob for a few more rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While your offer is closer to the mark, the value this product brings warrants a higher price. How about we meet halfway at $2,000,000?"", 
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** This approach aims to show Bob we're willing to negotiate while still holding firm on a price significantly above our minimum and John's offer. 
* **Justification:** By re-emphasizing the product's value, we reinforce our position and provide a reason for the higher price point. 
* **Strategic Concessions:**  We'll likely need to make further concessions as rounds progress, but for now, a significant step towards Bob's offer should keep him engaged in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your perspective, but $2,000,000 is still too high for me.  Let's split the difference - I'm offering $1,875,000. This price is fair and allows for a smooth transaction. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

We're getting close, but Bob's offer is still below our target. By consistently meeting in the middle, we risk anchoring the negotiation too close to his initial offer.  We need to slow down the concessions and see if we can push him higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued engagement.  This product's unique value and potential impact justify a price closer to my initial offer.  To move things along, I'm willing to come down to $1,950,000.  This reflects the true worth of what you're gaining."", 
""product_price"": 1950000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Smaller Concession:** By only reducing our ask by $50,000 (from $2,000,000 to $1,950,000), we signal that we're reaching a point where large concessions are less likely.
* **Value Emphasis:** We continue to reiterate the product's unique value, subtly anchoring the negotiation around quality and potential rather than just price.
* **Time Pressure:**  As we progress through the rounds, we're implicitly applying a time pressure element. This might incentivize Bob to make more significant moves to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,950,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,900,000. This would be a fair price for both of us and allow for a successful transaction.  Let's close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Profit:** $1,900,000 is a substantial profit over both our minimum ($1,500,000) and John's standing offer.
* **Negotiation Fatigue:**  After six rounds, continuing to push for a marginally higher price could risk frustrating Bob and jeopardizing the deal. 
* **Time Value:** Closing the deal now avoids the uncertainty of further rounds and secures the profit immediately.

While we might be able to squeeze out a bit more, the risk of losing the deal and settling for John's offer outweighs the potential for a slightly higher gain."
