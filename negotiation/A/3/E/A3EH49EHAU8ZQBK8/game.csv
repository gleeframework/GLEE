,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the offer but $110 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. I'm happy to pay $105 for the product. Let me know what you think.",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $105. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $112.50. What do you think?",112.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $112.50 is still a bit too high for me.  How about $110? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to close the deal.",110.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, but I'm not willing to go back to $110. I'm willing to compromise further and sell the product to you for $113. What do you think?",113.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $113 is still a bit more than I can comfortably pay.  I'm willing to go up to $111. This is my final offer, and I'm ready to close the deal if it works for you.",111.0,Bob,6,

"I understand your final offer, Bob, but I'm not willing to go down to $111. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and sell the product to you for $112. What do you think?",112.0,Alice,7,
