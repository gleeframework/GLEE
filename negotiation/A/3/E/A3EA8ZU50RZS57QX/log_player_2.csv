"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm asking for $130 for it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's initial offer is quite high, leaving room for negotiation. We should try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $130 seems a bit steep for me. Would you consider $100?"",
""product_price"": 100
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** By starting with a significantly lower offer ($100), we aim to gauge Alice's flexibility and leave room for negotiation. 
* **Direct Approach:** The message is polite but direct, expressing that the initial price is too high and proposing an alternative.
* **Strategic Positioning:** This counteroffer positions us well for future rounds, as Alice is likely to counter with a price between $100 and $130."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $115? That's still a great deal for you considering the value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Good Deal:** $115 is a reasonable price, saving us $35 from John's offer and $15 from Alice's initial offer.
* **Negotiation Progress:** Alice has already made a significant concession by coming down from $130 to $115.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Continuing to negotiate might yield a slightly better price, but the potential savings are likely small and not worth the risk of Alice withdrawing the offer altogether."
