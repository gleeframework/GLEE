"I appreciate you offering this product, Alice. However, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it.  This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in this product. Let's see if we can make this work.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $850,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $1,100,000. This is a fair compromise considering the value I believe the product holds. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you're getting closer to your bottom line, but $1,050,000 is still a stretch for my budget. I'm offering $1,000,000 for the product. This is a serious offer, and I'm ready to close the deal today. Let's make this work.",1000000.0,Bob,6,

"I'm starting to think we're getting close, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,025,000. I'm willing to make one last attempt to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $1,075,000, but I'll do $1,050,000. This is my absolute final offer. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to explore other options.",1050000.0,Alice,9,
