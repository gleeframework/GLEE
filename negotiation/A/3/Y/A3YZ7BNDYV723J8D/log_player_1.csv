{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm willing to offer it to you for $130. I believe it's a fair price considering its worth to you."", 
""product_price"": 130
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $150.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $80. 
* **Maximizing Profit:** Offering the product at $130 gives Bob a good deal (saving him $20) while allowing you to make a significant profit ($50). This strategy aims to secure a deal with Bob, who offers higher potential profit than your backup buyer, John."
