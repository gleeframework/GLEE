"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for it. Can you consider my offer?",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $9,500 is a good starting point, I'm looking for something a bit closer to $11,000. Let's split the difference and see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, but $11,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $10,250. Can you consider this revised offer?",10250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm going to need to come back with $10,750.  That's a significant compromise on my end, and I hope we can close the deal at this price.",10750.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're making a compromise, but $10,750 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $10,500, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at this price?",10500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I respect your position, but $10,500 is still a bit below what I need to make this worthwhile. How about we meet in the middle at $10,625? This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us.",10625.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're making a final offer, but I'm still not comfortable with $10,625. I'm willing to go up to $10,400, but that's as high as I can go. I hope we can meet at this price.",10400.0,Bob,8,
