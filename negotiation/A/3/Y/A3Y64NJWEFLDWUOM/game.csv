"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value and the market rate. I'm willing to make a compromise, but I need to stay within my budget of $8,000. Can you meet me halfway?",9000.0,Bob,2,
