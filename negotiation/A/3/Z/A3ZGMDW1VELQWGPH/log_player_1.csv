Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be interested in. It's worth a lot to me, so I'm asking for $120 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than your minimum:** $120 is above your $80 minimum, so you're already getting a profit.
* **It's not too high:**  $120 leaves room for negotiation, as Bob values the product at $150.  
* **It's clear and concise:** This message clearly states the price and shows you're willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer but $120 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. I'm happy to pay $90 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $90 is better than selling to John for $80, it's still lower than my minimum acceptable price of $100. I'm willing to risk another round of negotiation to see if I can get a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $90 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $105?  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 105}
