"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'll love. I'm offering it to you for $100. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:** $100 is a good starting point as it's above Bob's perceived value ($80) but gives room for negotiation. 
* **Avoiding John:** By starting at $100, I'm not immediately resorting to John's offer, allowing for a possible deal with Bob.
* **Positive Tone:**  A friendly message can help build rapport and encourage Bob to engage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value to Alice:** While $90 is better than Bob's initial perceived value of $80, it's still below Alice's minimum threshold of $120.
* **Negotiation Potential:** There's still room for negotiation. Alice can likely get a better price by making a counteroffer and seeing if Bob is willing to move higher.
* **Avoiding John:** Selling to John would be a guaranteed $120, but Alice wants to maximize her profits. Rejecting Bob's offer allows for further negotiation and potentially a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $95? It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 95} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  Offering $95 shows willingness to negotiate while still staying above Alice's minimum value.
* **Positive Framing:** ""Split the difference"" emphasizes fairness and a win-win situation.
* **Increasing Pressure:** This counteroffer gradually increases the price, subtly putting pressure on Bob to meet Alice's needs."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit short on budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $92? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:**  $92 is still very close to Alice's minimum value of $120. Accepting it would only bring a small profit.
* **Negotiation Leverage:** There are still 6 rounds left. Continuing to negotiate could potentially lead to a higher price.
* **Minimizing Risk:** While selling to John guarantees $120, there's still a chance that Bob will increase his offer in the following rounds. Rejecting his current offer keeps the negotiation alive."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $92 is still a bit too low for me. Let's meet in the middle again at $94. It's a small step closer to your offer and still a fair deal."", ""product_price"": 94}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Incremental Increase:**  Offering $94 shows flexibility while still gradually increasing the price.
* **Emphasizing Fair Deal:**  Highlighting the ""fair deal"" aspect reinforces the idea of a mutually beneficial agreement.
* **Maintaining Pressure:**  Continuing to push for a higher price keeps the negotiation active and potentially leads to a better outcome for Alice."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still trying to stretch my budget as far as I can. Would you be willing to meet me at $91? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $91. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $91
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Running Out:** With only four rounds left, the negotiation is becoming increasingly time-consuming.
* **Limited Gains:**  Bob's offer of $91 is still significantly below Alice's minimum value of $120.
* **Guaranteed Profit:** Selling to John guarantees Alice a profit of $120, which is her minimum target and a safer option than continuing to negotiate with Bob. 
* **Potential for Stalemate:** It's unlikely that Bob will increase his offer significantly in the remaining rounds, potentially leading to a stalemate and missed opportunity."
