You can get the product for a lower price from John, so rejecting Alice's offer and proceeding to counter-offer is the best option."

While Alice's offer is closer to your target, it's still above the price John is offering. It's worth continuing to negotiate with Alice to see if you can get a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet us in the middle, Bob, but I'm still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to compromise at $1320000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair price for both of us.

Alice's offer is still above what John is offering. While a bit more negotiation might get Alice down to your target price, it's not guaranteed.  Since John is offering a definite deal at your target price, it's safer to go with John."
