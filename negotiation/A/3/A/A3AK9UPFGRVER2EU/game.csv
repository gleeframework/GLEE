"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I'm looking to pay a bit less.  I'm willing to offer $1250000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to me and allows for some profit for you.",1250000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, Bob, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1350000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit on this deal.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your need to make a profit, but I'm still not comfortable with $1350000. I'm happy to meet you halfway on our previous offers and offer $1300000. This is a fair price that allows us both to make a reasonable deal.",1300000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet us in the middle, Bob, but I'm still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to compromise at $1320000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair price for both of us.",1320000.0,Alice,5,
