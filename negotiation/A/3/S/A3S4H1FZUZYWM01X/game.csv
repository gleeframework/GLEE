"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I don't think I can go any higher than that. Let me know what you think!",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, though. How about $14,000?  That's a fair compromise, and it allows us both to get a good deal.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for considering my offer and coming down to $14,000. I'm still a bit hesitant to pay that much, but I'm willing to meet you halfway again. How about $13,500? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",13500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued negotiation, but $13,500 is still a bit too low for me. To be fair to both of us, how about $14,500? This is my final offer. Let me know what you think.",14500.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I understand that you're willing to make one final offer, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I can only go up to $13,000. That's my final offer. If you're willing to accept it, I'll buy the product from you.",13000.0,Bob,6,
