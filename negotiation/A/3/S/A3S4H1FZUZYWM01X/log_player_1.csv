Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I don't think I can go any higher than that. Let me know what you think! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum desired price of $15,000.  I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, hoping to get closer to my target price."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, though. How about $14,000?  That's a fair compromise, and it allows us both to get a good deal."", ""product_price"": 14000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for considering my offer and coming down to $14,000. I'm still a bit hesitant to pay that much, but I'm willing to meet you halfway again. How about $13,500? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $13,500 is getting closer to my minimum price of $15,000, I'm still hesitant to sell for less than my target. I'm willing to make one final counteroffer to see if I can get Bob to agree to a price closer to my desired amount."

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that you're willing to make one final offer, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I can only go up to $13,000. That's my final offer. If you're willing to accept it, I'll buy the product from you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's final offer of $13,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. I'm not willing to go any lower. Since John is willing to pay my minimum price, I'm better off selling the product to John and avoiding further negotiation."
