"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm afraid $9000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and quality. I'm confident you'll find it's worth the investment.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still interested in the product, but I need to be mindful of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll make a counteroffer of $10250. That's my best offer for now.",10250.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $10250. I'm willing to make a slight adjustment and offer it to you for $11200. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a great value for the product.",11200.0,Alice,5,

"I'm still interested in the product, but I'm not willing to go up to $11200. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll make a counteroffer of $10750. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle and make a deal.",10750.0,Bob,6,
