"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think would be perfect for you. My asking price is $12,000. Let me know what you think!",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Would you be willing to consider that price?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $9,000 is a bit too low for me.  However, I'm willing to come down to $10,500 to see if we can reach a deal.  What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $10,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,000 and $10,500. Would you consider $9,750?",9750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $9,750 is unfortunately still below my minimum. How about we split the difference and try $10,125? I'm hoping we can reach a deal soon.",10125.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your persistence. However, $10,125 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $9,900, but that's as high as I can go. Would you consider that price?",9900.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're making an effort, and I appreciate that. However, $9,900 is still a bit too low for me.  Considering your previous offer and my own need to get a fair price, I'm willing to come down to $10,000. I'm hoping we can finalize this deal in the next few rounds.",10000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down to $10,000. However, I'm still a bit short on budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $9,800?",9800.0,Bob,8,
