Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I believe this product presents a unique opportunity and is worth a significant sum to the right buyer. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. I think it's a fair price considering the value it holds."", 
""product_price"": 900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,000,000, you want to see if Bob will pay more.
* **Strong Opening:** Starting at $900,000 leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle but ensures you're still making a significant profit over John's offer.
* **Value Emphasis:** The message highlights the ""unique opportunity"" and ""value"" to make the price more palatable to Bob."
