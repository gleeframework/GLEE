"I'm interested in the product, but I think $20,000 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $12,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value, but I'm willing to negotiate further if needed.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your interest and counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the price. While $20,000 reflects the true value of this product, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $16,000?",16000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice. However, $16,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $14,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value, and I'm willing to compromise further if needed.",14000.0,Bob,4,
