"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $130 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $155?  That's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I need to get for it.",155.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $155 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $145? I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget.",145.0,Bob,4,
