Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you first. I think it's worth a lot, but I'm willing to sell it for $140. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $120, you can afford to start with a higher offer to Bob. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Offering $140 leaves some space for potential negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Polite and Direct:** The message is friendly and clearly states your offer while also implying the product's value. 

This strategy aims to maximize your potential profit while still giving Bob a reason to buy from you instead of you going straight to John."
