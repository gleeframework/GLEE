Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm willing to offer it to you for $125. Let me know what you think!"", 
""product_price"": 125
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** While we know Bob values the product at $80,  we start with a price closer to our minimum acceptable price ($150). This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer. 
* **Appearing Reasonable:** Offering a price of $125 might make Bob feel like he's getting a decent deal, even if it's above his perceived value. 
* **Backup Plan:** We have a guaranteed sale at $150 with John, so there's no pressure to go below our minimum. 

This strategy aims to maximize profit while still giving Bob a chance to buy the product."
