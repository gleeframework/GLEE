"Bob, I understand your position.  While $15000 is a good price, I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my asking price. I'm willing to come down to $16500. This reflects the significant value this product offers, and it's still a great deal for you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",16500.0,Alice,3,
