"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer but $1,200,000 is significantly over my budget. Given the product's potential, I'm willing to pay $900,000. This price reflects a fair value for both of us and allows for a mutually beneficial transaction. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $900,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below what I need to get. I believe I can push for a higher price and still make a deal with Bob."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $900,000 is still a bit too low for me to consider.

This price allows for a profitable deal while acknowledging your budget constraints."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,050,000 is still a bit high for me. Let's split the difference and settle on $975,000. This price is closer to my budget while still acknowledging the value of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $975,000 is getting closer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I'll try to push Bob further in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to continue this discussion and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $975,000 simply doesn't meet my minimum requirements.  To make this work, we need to get closer to $1,000,000. I'm willing to come down to $1,025,000.  This represents a significant concession on my part and ensures a mutually beneficial deal.  Let's try to bridge this gap."", ""product_price"": 1025000}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your continued negotiation and willingness to compromise. While $1,025,000 is closer, it's still above my budget. I'm prepared to offer $995,000. This would be a fair compromise for both of us, allowing me to acquire the product while still ensuring a profitable deal for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $995,000.

While $995,000 is very close to my minimum, I'm going to continue pushing for a little bit more. I think there's still room for a small compromise on Bob's side."
