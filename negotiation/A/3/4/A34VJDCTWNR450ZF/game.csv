"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit hesitant to sell it for $130. How about we meet in the middle at $155? It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product!",155.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $155 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm happy to pay $140, which is a fair price for both of us. What do you say?",140.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $150. I'm willing to compromise, though. How about we meet at $145? It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product!",145.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, $145 is still a little higher than I'm willing to go. I'm really interested in this product, but I can't go beyond $140. If you're willing to meet me there, I'm ready to buy.",140.0,Bob,6,
