"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $8,000.  Let me know what you think.",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer of $8,000. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm not willing to sell it to you at that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. I'll sell it to you for $10,500. This is a fair price, considering its true worth to you is $10,000. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're still trying to get the best deal. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I get a good return on my investment. I'll sell it to you for $10,250. This is my final offer. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'll consider it a done deal.",10250.0,Alice,5,
