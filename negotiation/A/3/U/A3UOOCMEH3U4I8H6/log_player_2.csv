"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be a valuable asset to you.  While I can't disclose specifics at this stage, I can assure you it's worth at least $1200000 to me. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1500000.  This is a significant opportunity, and I'm confident it will be mutually beneficial. Please let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's offer of $1,500,000 exceeds Bob's maximum budget of $1,200,000.  Even though Alice claims the product is worth at least $1,200,000 to her, Bob doesn't know the true value and doesn't want to risk overpaying. 

It's better to reject Alice's offer and buy the product from John for $1,200,000, which is within Bob's budget."
