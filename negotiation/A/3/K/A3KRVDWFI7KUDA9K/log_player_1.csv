{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and think you'd really appreciate it. I'm offering it to you for $140. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

This offer starts at a price slightly above Bob's perceived value, leaving room for negotiation while still getting closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm really interested in the product, but $140 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price, and selling to John guarantees me my desired profit. However, I'm willing to try and negotiate with Bob further to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest but $100 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $125? It's still a good deal for you, and it gets me closer to my desired price."", ""product_price"": 125}
```"
