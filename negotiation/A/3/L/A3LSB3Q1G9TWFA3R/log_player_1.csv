Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  However, $13,000 is a bit too high for my budget.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $6,000 for it.

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:

It's clear Bob is very unlikely to meet the minimum price.  Cutting losses now and selling to John guarantees the best outcome."
