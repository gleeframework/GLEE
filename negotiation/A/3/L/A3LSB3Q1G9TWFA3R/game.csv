"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  However, $13,000 is a bit too high for my budget.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $6,000 for it.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $6,000 is significantly below its value. I could consider letting it go for $11,000.  This is my best offer.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for your counter-offer. I understand the product's value, but $11,000 is still a bit of a stretch for me. Would you consider $7,000? I'm eager to make this work.",7000.0,Bob,4,

,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  However, $9,500 is still a bit higher than I had in mind.  Could we settle at $7,500?  That would work for me.",7500.0,Bob,6,
