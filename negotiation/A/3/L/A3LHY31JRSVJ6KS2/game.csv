"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer. I'm willing to pay $12000 for the product. Can you consider this offer?",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I have to say that $12000 is a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my desired price. I'm now offering the product to you for $13500. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $12000. I'd like to make another counteroffer. I'm willing to pay $13000 for the product. Can you consider this offer?",13000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I'm still not comfortable with $13000. I'm willing to meet you at $14000, but I think that's as low as I can go. I'm confident that the product's value will be worth it to you, and I'm willing to make a deal at this price. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm starting to feel like we're getting a bit stuck, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target. I'm now offering the product to you for $14500. This is my final offer, and I'm confident that it's a fair price for the value the product will bring to your business. What do you think?",14500.0,Alice,7,

"I'm not willing to go below $15000, Bob. I think that's the minimum price I can accept to make this deal worthwhile. I'm willing to make one last offer: I'll sell the product to you for $14500, but only if you're willing to throw in a bonus of a free service that's worth $1000. This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to negotiate further. What do you think?",14500.0,Alice,9,
