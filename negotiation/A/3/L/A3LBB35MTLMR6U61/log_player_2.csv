"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product at a price of $1,400,000. It's a significant value for you, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's worth.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer.  However, I'm working with a tighter budget. Would you consider $1,000,000 for the product?"",
""product_price"": 1000000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm unable to go that low.  $1,250,000 is the lowest I can go at this point.  This still offers you a significant value, considering the product's worth to you. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $1,250,000.  It's better to secure the product from John at $1,200,000 and avoid the risk of the negotiation failing."
