"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.  This price still gives you a good deal, and allows me to make a profit.  Let's see if we can agree on this.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. How about we meet in the middle at $950,000? That's a fair deal for both of us.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $950,000 is still too low for me.  Let's compromise at $1,050,000.  This price is fair for both of us, and it allows me to cover my costs.  Let's finalize this deal.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
