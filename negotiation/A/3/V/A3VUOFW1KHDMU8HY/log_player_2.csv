{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

The goal is to save as much money as possible.  $120 is still too high.  It's worth exploring if we can get a better price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

**Explanation:**

We're aiming to get a price closer to our maximum of $150 while leaving room for negotiation. A counteroffer of $100 is a reasonable starting point."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

**Explanation:**

We've rejected Alice's offer of $130, so we'll counter with $110. This is a compromise, moving closer to her previous offer but staying below our initial target of $100. This should keep the negotiations moving while still leaving some room for Alice to adjust her price."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $135 is closer to our maximum, but we're still within our negotiation window. We've shown willingness to compromise, so it's worth another counteroffer to see if we can get a better price. There are still rounds left, so we have time to keep negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}

**Explanation:**

We've rejected Alice's offer of $135, but we're getting closer to a deal.  We'll counter with $120,  which is closer to Alice's last offer and closer to our maximum. This counteroffer demonstrates our willingness to compromise while still pushing for a better price. We have a few rounds left to finalize the deal."

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $140 is getting closer to our maximum of $150, but it's still too high. We've already shown a willingness to compromise, so we can try one more counteroffer to see if we can get a better price. We still have a few rounds left, and we're not yet at a point where buying from John is the better option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
```

**Explanation:**

We're getting close to the end of our negotiation window.  Alice's offer of $140 is still too high, but it's worth one more counteroffer to see if we can bridge the gap.  We're willing to go up to $130, which is closer to her offer and is still within our budget. We have only two rounds left, so we need to be strategic."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $145.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $145
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $145 is only $5 less than what John is offering. With only one round left, it's not worth risking further negotiation. It's better to secure the product at a slightly higher price from John than to risk getting no deal at all with Alice."
