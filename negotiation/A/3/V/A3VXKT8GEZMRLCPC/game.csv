"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it holds immense value, and I'm confident it can greatly benefit you. I'm initially offering it for $2,000,000. This is a premium price reflecting its exceptional quality and potential, but I'm open to discussing details and finding a solution that works for us both.",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I recognize the value of this product,  $2,000,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm prepared to offer $1,300,000, which is still a fair price for the benefits it provides. Let's see if we can reach a mutually agreeable solution.",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, and I understand your perspective on the price.  To be candid, $2,000,000 is my ideal target, but I'm willing to negotiate to make this work. How about we meet halfway and settle at $1,650,000? This reflects the product's true worth while acknowledging your budget considerations.",1650000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,650,000 is still higher than what I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000. This is a fair price considering the value you've described and my budget constraints. Let's aim for a deal that benefits both of us.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
