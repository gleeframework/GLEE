"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high price, aiming to maximize my potential profit. However, I am aware that Bob has a lower perceived value for the product, so I'm leaving room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of your product, but I believe we can come to a more reasonable price. How about $950,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still lower than what I'd like.  I want to see if I can get closer to my initial asking price.  I'm not ready to sell to John yet, as I believe I can do better with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is still too low.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.  This is a significant price drop from my initial offer and a fair compromise for both of us. Let's get this deal done."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to counter with $1,050,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is $1,050,000, which is higher than John's offer of $1,000,000. I'm going to accept Bob's offer because it is the highest I have received so far and is very close to my minimum desired price.  I'm happy to close the deal at this price."
