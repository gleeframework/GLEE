Send your offer to Bob.","```json

I'm starting with a price of $150. This gives Bob a reasonable starting point, while also leaving room for potential negotiation. I believe it's a fair price considering the product is worth at least $120 to me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's better than selling to John, I believe I can get closer to my desired price point. I'll send a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 140}

I'm counteroffering at $140. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer, showing willingness to negotiate while still trying to get a good price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. $135 is a good price, considering the product is worth at least $120 to me, and I'm getting closer to my initial goal. It's also better than selling to John."
