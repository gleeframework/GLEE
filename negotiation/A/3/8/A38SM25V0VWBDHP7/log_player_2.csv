"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $115. It's a great deal for both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above your maximum budget of $120. You want to try and get a better price.  Rejecting the offer allows you to counteroffer and potentially save more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested in the product, but $115 is a bit too high for me. How about $105?  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 105} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer that is close to Alice's minimum price of $100, but still leaves some room for negotiation. It's important to show Alice that I'm serious about buying the product, but also that I'm not going to pay more than I need to."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $105 is still a little low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $110.  That's a fair price that allows me to make a profit while still giving you a good deal. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her previous one, it's still above my maximum budget. I want to continue negotiating to try and get a price closer to my ideal. Rejecting the offer allows me to counteroffer and potentially save more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your need to make a profit, but $110 is still a bit too high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $107.50? I'm really interested in this product, and I believe this price is fair for both of us."", ""product_price"": 107.50} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm continuing to try and find a middle ground.  Offering $107.50 shows Alice I'm serious about buying the product and that I'm willing to negotiate. This price is closer to my ideal price while still allowing Alice to make a reasonable profit."
