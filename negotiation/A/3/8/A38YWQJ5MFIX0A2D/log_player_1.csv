Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, but I still think $2,000,000 is a bit too high. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll offer $1,950,000. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price.

Bob is unlikely to go much higher, and $1,950,000 is a significant profit. Accepting now ensures we close the deal and don't risk him walking away."
