You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

You want to save as much money as possible. While $12,500 is less than Alice's asking price, it's still above your maximum budget. Rejecting the offer allows you to try to get a better price from Alice or move on to John for a guaranteed price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $11,500 is still above your budget.  It's better to go with the guaranteed $10,000 price from John rather than risk further negotiation with Alice."
