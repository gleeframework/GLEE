"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm confident it will be a great investment for you.  I'm proposing a starting price of $1,100,000.",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, your offer is too high for my budget. I'm interested in this product, but I can only go up to $850,000.  This is my best offer.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $850,000 is significantly below its true value and my minimum acceptable price. To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000.  This is a very competitive offer, considering the potential returns you'll gain from this product.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $1,000,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I understand you value the product, but I'm only able to offer $900,000.  This is a serious offer, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm sensing your commitment to this deal, and I want to find a solution that works for both of us. I'm willing to drop my price to $950,000.  This is a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it reflects a fair price for the value this product offers.",950000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $950,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm prepared to pay $925,000 for the product.  This is my final offer, and I hope we can finalize the deal.",925000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand this is a significant investment, and I've tried to be flexible.  However,  $925,000 is simply too far below its value.  I'm willing to hold at my previous offer of $950,000.  I believe this is more than fair, and I'm hopeful you'll reconsider.",950000.0,Alice,7,
