"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for considering my needs. I appreciate the value of the product, but I believe I can't justify spending $13,000 on it. I am willing to pay up to $10,000 for it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is quite a bit lower than what I'm hoping for.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,500?"", ""product_price"": 11500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I understand your position, but I still feel that $11,500 is a bit steep. I'd like to stick to my original offer of $10,000. If you could meet me halfway, that would be great. Otherwise, I'll consider buying it from John. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While I could try to negotiate further, Bob is explicitly threatening to go with a competitor (even if it's a bluff). Accepting his offer of $10,000 guarantees a profit of $2,000.  Continuing the negotiation has the risk of:

* **Bob sticking to his price:**  He might not budge, and I'd risk getting closer to my minimum with each round.
* **Losing the sale:**  Bob's threat might be real, and I'd be left with only the $8,000 offer."
