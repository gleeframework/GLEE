"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value of this product, $11,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for it. Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $11,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm still willing to negotiate. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $10,800. This is a great compromise, considering the value it holds for you. What do you think?",10800.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,800 is still a little high for me. I'm happy to offer you $10,600 for the product. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close the deal.",10600.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $10,600 is still a bit above your budget, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $10,700. This is as low as I can go, considering the value it holds for me. What do you think?",10700.0,Alice,5,
