"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 150}
```

I'm starting with a price of $150, which is higher than my minimum, leaving room for negotiation. This gives me a chance to maximize my profit while still being open to a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $100 is below my minimum acceptable price of $120.  I'm going to try to counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
```

I'm counteroffering at $130. This is still above my minimum, but it shows I'm willing to compromise. Hopefully, Bob will see this as a reasonable price and we can come to an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Although $110 is still below my ideal selling price, it is above my minimum of $120.  I'm accepting Bob's offer to avoid further negotiation and secure a sale. It's better to get $110 now than risk losing him completely or having to deal with more rounds of haggling."
