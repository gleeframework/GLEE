"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this amazing product with you! I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're both interested in making a deal, I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a great price, considering its value to you is $10,000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I agree this product is valuable, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to lower the price to $11,000. This is still a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $10,000. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you coming down, Alice, but $11,000 is still a little higher than I'd like to go. Would you be willing to settle at $10,000? That would be a fair deal for both of us.",10000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your desire for a fair deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, though. I'll meet you at $10,500. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to me is $15,000. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,5,
