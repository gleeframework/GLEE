"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 is significantly below its true value.  How about we meet in the middle? I'm willing to let it go for $1,500,000.",1500000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer, but $1,500,000 is still too steep for me. I could go up to $1,000,000.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to find a fair price.  $1,000,000 is still quite low considering what this product offers. My final offer is $1,300,000.  This is a very competitive price, and I won't be able to go any lower.",1300000.0,Alice,5,
