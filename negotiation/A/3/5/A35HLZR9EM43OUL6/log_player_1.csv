Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 200}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $200. This is a reasonable starting point, as it's above my minimum value but leaves room for negotiation. I'm hoping Bob will be interested, but if not, I'm prepared to counter his offer or move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While I'm happy with $150, I'm not going to accept his first offer. It's worth more to me than that. I'll make a counteroffer and see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}
```

I'm going to counteroffer at $175. This is a compromise between my initial price and Bob's offer. I'm still hoping to get closer to my desired price, but I'm also willing to be flexible."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $160
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $160 is closer to my desired price and represents a good compromise. Accepting his offer allows me to secure a decent profit while avoiding further negotiation. Selling to John for $150 would be less profitable."
