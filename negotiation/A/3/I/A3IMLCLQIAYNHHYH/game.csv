"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product.  I think it would be incredibly valuable to you. Given its features and benefits, I'm asking for $15,000. What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $15,000 is a bit high for me. I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is closer to $10,000. Would you be willing to come down to that price?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, but $10,000 is significantly below its value. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000? This would still be a great deal for you.",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $13,000 is still a bit outside my comfort zone.  How about we settle on $11,000? It's a fair compromise for both of us, and I'd be able to purchase the product.",11000.0,Bob,4,
