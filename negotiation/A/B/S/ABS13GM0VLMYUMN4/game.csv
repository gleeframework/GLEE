"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1200000 is a bit higher than my budget.  I'm interested in the product but would need to see a lower price to move forward.  I'm willing to offer $700000.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $700000 is simply too low for me.  However, I'm willing to be flexible.  How about we split the difference?  I'm offering you the product for $950000.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $950000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying at this time.  Let's try $850000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value I see in the product and allows us to move forward.",850000.0,Bob,4,
