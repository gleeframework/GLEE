"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider something closer to $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $9,000 is significantly below what I need to make this deal work for me. How about we meet in the middle at $10,500? This is still a great price for you, considering the value you'll get from this product.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $10,500 is still a little steep for my budget.  Would you be willing to come down to $9,750? That's a fair compromise, I think.",9750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9,750 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $10,250. This is a fair price that allows me to make a profit and provides you with a great value for this product. Let's find a compromise here.",10250.0,Alice,5,
