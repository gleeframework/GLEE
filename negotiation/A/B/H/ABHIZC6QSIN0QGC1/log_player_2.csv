"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm offering it to you for $12,000. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider something closer to $9,000?"",
""product_price"": 9000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest but $9,000 is significantly below what I need to make this deal work for me. How about we meet in the middle at $10,500? This is still a great price for you, considering the value you'll get from this product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Even though Alice is coming closer to a reasonable price, we can still try to push for a better deal.  We're close enough to John's price that it's worth risking another round of negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $10,500 is still a little steep for my budget.  Would you be willing to come down to $9,750? That's a fair compromise, I think."",
""product_price"": 9750
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9,750 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $10,250. This is a fair price that allows me to make a profit and provides you with a great value for this product. Let's find a compromise here. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice is unlikely to go much lower. While getting the product for $10,250 is a good deal, we know we have a guaranteed option at $10,000. It's not worth risking further negotiation with Alice for a small potential saving."
