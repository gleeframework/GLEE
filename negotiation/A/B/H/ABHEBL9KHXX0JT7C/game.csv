"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product, $9,500 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. I'm interested in making a deal, but I'd need to see the price closer to $7,500 to make it work for me.  Let me know what you think.",7500.0,Bob,2,

"I understand your position, Bob, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. However, I still need to make a profit on this sale. I can offer you a price of $8,200, which is a bit lower than my initial offer but still reflects the value of the product. Let me know if this is more to your liking.",8200.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $8,200 is closer, but I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to go up to $7,800.  Let's see if we can find common ground here.",7800.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Bob, and I'm willing to meet you at $7,800. However, I still need to make a profit, so I can offer you a price of $8,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. If you're still interested, let's finalize the deal at this price.",8000.0,Alice,5,
