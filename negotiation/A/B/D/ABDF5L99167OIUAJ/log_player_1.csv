Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for sale at a price of $14,000. I believe it's a fair offer considering its value. Let me know if you're interested!"",
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:** We know Bob values the product at $8,000, and we have a guaranteed sale at $15,000 from John.  We want to find the highest price Bob would accept to maximize our profit.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $14,000 leaves some room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer. It's unlikely Bob would accept an offer close to $15,000, so starting slightly lower increases the chances of making a deal.
* **Time Value of Money:** Selling to Bob quickly, even at a slightly lower price, might be preferable over waiting for the guaranteed sale to John. This depends on how quickly Alice needs the money and how certain the deal with John is."
