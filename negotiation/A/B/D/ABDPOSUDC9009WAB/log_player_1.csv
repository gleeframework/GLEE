{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. It's a valuable piece, and I think this price reflects its worth. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's above Bob's perceived value of $800,000, but still lower than your minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. This gives Bob some room to negotiate, but it also ensures you're not giving away too much value. 

Remember, you always have the option to go with John's offer of $1,000,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for it. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than what I'm willing to accept. While I can go with John's offer of $1,000,000, it's still worth trying to negotiate with Bob. There's a chance we can meet somewhere in the middle, and I'm not ready to give up on a potentially better deal."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. $750,000 is a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $850,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $775,000 for the product. Can you meet me at this price?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $775,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $775,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000, it's still quite a bit lower than what I'm hoping to get. I'm going to try one more counteroffer to see if we can reach a compromise."

Bob's final offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  While I'd like to continue negotiating, I've reached my limit and don't want to risk losing out on a guaranteed deal. I'm going to accept John's offer of $1,000,000."
