"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm proposing a price of $9,500 for the product. This is a great deal, considering its value to you is $12,000. I'm confident you'll love it, and I'm looking forward to hearing back from you!",9500.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $9,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'd be willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing you to still make a profit while giving me a significant discount.  What do you think?",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. After careful consideration, I'm willing to meet you halfway.
