"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm proposing a price of $9,500 for the product. This is a great deal, considering its value to you is $12,000. I'm confident you'll love it, and I'm looking forward to hearing back from you! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than buying from John, there's still room for negotiation.  As Bob, I want to save as much money as possible. Rejecting the offer allows me to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $9,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'd be willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing you to still make a profit while giving me a significant discount.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. After careful consideration, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm proposing a price of $9,000 for the product. This is a fair compromise that still allows me to make a decent profit while giving you a significant discount. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $9,000, which is a fair price for me as Bob. While I could try to negotiate further, the risk is that Alice might reject my counteroffer and I might end up paying $12,000 to John. It's better to accept the offer and secure the product at a reasonable price."
