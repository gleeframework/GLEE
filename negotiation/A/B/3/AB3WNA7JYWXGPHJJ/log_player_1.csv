Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm starting with my desired price of $120.  This is the minimum I'm willing to accept, given the value of the product to me and the alternative buyer John.  Let's see if Bob is willing to pay my price!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $95 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my desired price and lower than what John is willing to pay. I'm going to try to counteroffer and see if I can get closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm going to counteroffer with $110. This is a compromise, acknowledging Bob's lower offer while still staying above his value for the product and closer to my desired price. Hopefully, this will be more appealing to Bob than his previous offer and get us closer to a deal!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $105 is closer to my desired price, it's still below what I'm willing to accept given the value of the product to me. I'm going to reject this offer and see if I can negotiate further with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 115}

I'm going to counteroffer with $115. This is a slight compromise from my previous offer, but still above Bob's value for the product.  I think this might be a good middle ground that could lead to a deal."
