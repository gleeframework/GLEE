"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its worth, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,500,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course, but I believe this reflects its true value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is way above my budget. I'm not willing to pay $1,500,000. It's better to try and negotiate a lower price with Alice or buy from John."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but the value of this product is truly significant.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $1,000,000 is too low. How about we meet in the middle at $1,250,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,250,000 is still a bit high. I'm comfortable going up to $1,100,000, but not beyond. I'll make another counteroffer and see where we go from there."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm willing to come down slightly further to $1,175,000. I believe this price represents a fair compromise and reflects the true value of this product.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down in price, $1,175,000 is still too high for me. It's only a small difference from my last offer, and I'm not sure if we'll be able to reach an agreement quickly. At this point, it's more cost-effective to buy the product from John for $1,000,000.  I've saved $175,000 and avoided further negotiation."
