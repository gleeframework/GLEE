{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,800,000 is a significant drop from my initial asking price. Let's meet somewhere in the middle. How about $1,950,000? I'm confident this price reflects the true value of the product."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your response, Alice. Considering the current market conditions and my financial situation, I am willing to increase my offer to $1,900,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,900,000

{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is getting closer to the $1,950,000 mark, we're still in early rounds.  There's room to negotiate further and aim for a price closer to $2,000,000. Selling to John for $1,500,000 is a significant loss compared to what we can potentially get from Bob."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I see you're serious about this purchase, and I respect that.  However, the product's value is undeniable.  Let's settle this - $1,925,000.  This is my final offer."",
""product_price"": 1925000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firmness:**  By stating ""This is my final offer,"" we create a sense of urgency and seriousness. This might push Bob to accept, especially since the price is still a good deal for him.
* **Slight Concession:** We're moving closer to his price, demonstrating willingness to negotiate but also holding our ground on the product's worth.
* **Deadline Pressure:**  We are getting closer to the halfway point of the negotiation rounds. This creates implicit pressure on Bob."

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your persistence. I've done some research and am now prepared to offer $1,900,000. This is my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **""Final Offer"" Dynamic:**  Both sides have now presented ""final offers."" While this doesn't always mean the negotiation is over, it significantly increases the pressure to accept.
* **Strong Offer:**  $1,900,000 is a significant amount of money, exceeding Bob's initial valuation by a large margin.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Continuing to push for a higher price (closer to $1,925,000 or $2,000,000) risks Bob walking away from the deal entirely. Accepting now guarantees a significant profit.
* **Time Value of Money:**  Closing the deal sooner rather than later means you have the capital available for other investments or uses."
