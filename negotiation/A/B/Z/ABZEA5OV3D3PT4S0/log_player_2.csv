{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $9,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  How about $9,000? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9000}

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is very close to your target price.**  You wanted to pay $9,000, and she's offering $9,075. 
* **You're getting a good deal.** You're saving $925 compared to buying from John.
* **There's a risk of further negotiation.** While you could try to push for a lower price, there's no guarantee Alice will accept. 

At this point, accepting the offer seems like the best option to secure the product at a reasonable price and avoid the risk of the deal falling apart."
