"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're looking for a more reasonable price, but I'm afraid I'm not willing to go as low as $900000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1050000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's still a fair price for a high-quality product like this.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I can see that you're getting close to your target, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $975000.

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to make one final compromise, but I'm still not convinced that $1015000 is the best price for this product. I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $980000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market conditions and the product's value. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle and come to an agreement.",980000.0,Bob,8,
