"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob can get a better deal than $12,000.  Since Alice values the product at $10,000, there's room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer opens the door for Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially save more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to get the best deal possible, so he's starting with a counteroffer that's still higher than Alice's value but significantly lower than her initial asking price. This gives Alice room to negotiate while still allowing Bob to save money."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is still higher than Bob's ideal price, but lower than John's offer. Bob still has room to negotiate and potentially get a better deal by rejecting the offer and sending another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to find a middle ground between his initial offer of $11,000 and Alice's counteroffer of $12,500. This keeps the negotiation moving while still attempting to secure a lower price than John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

At this point, Alice's counteroffer of $13,000 is getting closer to Bob's maximum price of $15,000. It's no longer worth the risk of further negotiation with Alice. While Bob might be able to get a slightly lower price with more rounds, there's no guarantee.  Buying from John for $15,000 is a safer option and ensures Bob gets the product within his budget."
