Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $120.  It's a great deal for both of us!  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 120}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Starting Point:**  I'm aiming for a price that's significantly higher than my minimum but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Message:** I'm being friendly and focusing on the value proposition for Bob.  
* **Strategy:**  This initial offer is a good starting point. If Bob rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of a price around $100. Would you be willing to consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is lower than my desired price, but still higher than my minimum.**  I'm not going to settle for $100 just yet, especially since Bob clearly believes the product is worth more.
* **My goal is to maximize my profit.** Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to continue negotiating and potentially get a better price. 
* **I'm not ready to sell to John for $80.** While it's a guaranteed sale, I believe I can get a higher price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While $100 is tempting, I'm still hoping to get closer to my original asking price.  How about we split the difference and go with $110?  It's a fair price for both of us, and it keeps the deal moving forward."", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm meeting Bob halfway, showing I'm willing to negotiate.  
* **Focus on Fairness:**  I'm emphasizing that $110 is a fair price for both of us.
* **Momentum:**  I'm trying to keep the negotiation going, highlighting the benefits of reaching a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your perspective, but $110 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so how about $105? That's the best I can do. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Close to my desired price:**  $105 is only $5 away from my previous offer, and significantly higher than selling to John.
* **Potential for further negotiation:** While Bob claims it's his ""best offer,"" there's always the possibility of a counteroffer in the future.
* **Risk of losing the deal:** If I reject, there's a chance Bob might walk away or lower his offer further. It's safer to accept and potentially negotiate later."
