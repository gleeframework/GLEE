Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to get to $10,000, Bob, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer you the product for $10,500. It's a fair price, considering the value this product brings. What do you think?

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Alice has come down significantly and is now only $500 above your ideal price. It's unlikely she'll go much lower, and continuing to negotiate risks her withdrawing the offer altogether. Accepting at $10,500 secures you a good deal."
