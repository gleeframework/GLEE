Round 2

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $850,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $900,000?

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 6
Bob's offer:

I'm going to accept Bob's offer of $880,000.  While I was hoping for a bit more, it's getting late in the negotiation, and this is a good deal for me. It's also likely that Bob won't budge further."
