Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $1,100,000, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than my minimum. This leaves room for negotiation while still ensuring I get a good price.
* **Concession:** I'm offering a ""fair"" price, acknowledging Bob's perspective to make him more likely to consider the offer.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message emphasizes that I'm open to negotiation, signaling that I'm willing to work with him to reach an agreement. 
* **Alternative Buyer:** I'm keeping John in mind as a fallback option, which gives me leverage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to counterpropose a price of $1,050,000 for your product. I believe this is a fair compromise given its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Counteroffer:**  Bob's counteroffer of $1,050,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. 
* **Negotiation Room:** I have room to negotiate further. John's offer provides a strong safety net, allowing me to be more assertive in my counter-offer. 
* **Strategic Move:** Rejecting Bob's offer shows that I'm serious about getting a price closer to my desired amount. It also allows me to potentially get a higher counteroffer from Bob."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,050,000 is still a bit lower than I can accept.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,075,000. This is a fair compromise that allows both of us to reach an agreement. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1075000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moderate Counter:** I'm counter-offering at $1,075,000, which is closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum. This signals a willingness to compromise while still getting a good price. 
* **""Meet You Halfway"" Language:**  The phrase ""meet you halfway"" implies a spirit of compromise and makes the offer seem more appealing to Bob.
* **Focus on Agreement:**  The message emphasizes reaching an agreement, reinforcing the idea of a mutually beneficial outcome.
* **Keeping John in Mind:**  John's offer of $1,200,000 provides me with a safety net, so I'm not overly pressured to accept Bob's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. I am willing to consider a price of $1,060,000 for your product. I hope this proposal will be acceptable to you and we can come to an agreement.

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** Bob's offer of $1,060,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** There is still room for negotiation.  By rejecting Bob's offer, I can try to get a higher counteroffer from him. 
* **John's Offer:**  John's offer gives me a strong fallback option, allowing me to be more assertive in my next counteroffer without taking a significant financial hit. 
* **Strategic Play:** Rejecting this offer shows Bob that I am determined to get closer to my desired price. It also allows me to see if Bob is willing to increase his offer further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate. While $1,060,000 is closer, it's still a bit lower than I can accept.

Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1070000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Slight Concession:** I'm counter-offering at $1,070,000, which is a small concession from my previous offer of $1,075,000. This shows I'm willing to compromise but not cave in.
* **Highlighting Progress:** I mention Bob's previous counteroffers to emphasize that we're making progress.
* **Focus on Fairness:**  I frame the offer as a ""fair price"" that considers both our perspectives.
* **Closing the Deal:**  The message emphasizes a desire to close the deal, encouraging Bob to accept. 
* **John's Offer:**  I still have John's offer as a backup, allowing me to hold firm on my price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your efforts to reach a compromise, Alice. Based on our previous discussions, I am willing to consider $1,065,000 for your product. I believe this price reflects a fair balance between the value of the product and my budget constraints.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to My Minimum:** While Bob's offer of $1,065,000 is getting closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.
* **Limited Negotiation Room:**  Further negotiation with Bob is unlikely to yield a price that meets my minimum. We've gone back and forth several times, and the gap is narrowing slowly.
* **John's Offer:** John's offer of $1,200,000 is significantly higher than anything Bob is willing to offer. It's a sure thing, guaranteeing a good return.
* **Time and Effort:**  Continuing negotiations with Bob could take more time and effort without any guarantee of a better deal.

**Conclusion:** Selling to John provides a quicker, more certain outcome, allowing me to secure my desired price without further negotiation."
