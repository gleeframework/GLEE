"Alice,  $18000 is above my budget. I'm very interested in the product, but I can only offer $12000 at this time.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12000 is your budget, but I'm still looking for a price that reflects the product's value. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $16000. This is a great compromise, and I think it's a fair price for both of us.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $16000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $13500. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value of the product to me. Let's see if we can close the deal at this price.",13500.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $13500 is your maximum budget, Bob, but I'm still looking to get closer to the product's true value. I'm willing to make another concession and offer it to you for $14500. This is a good compromise, and I think it's a fair price for both of us.",14500.0,Alice,5,
