"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm willing to sell it to you for $18000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $18,000 is way above his maximum budget of $12,000. It's best to see if he can negotiate a better price before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  $18,000 is above my budget. I'm very interested in the product, but I can only offer $12,000 at this time.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12000 is your budget, but I'm still looking for a price that reflects the product's value. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $16000. This is a great compromise, and I think it's a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $16,000 is better than $18,000, it's still above Bob's budget. He should try to negotiate further to see if he can get a better deal. It's not time to buy from John yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $16,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $13,500. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value of the product to me. Let's see if we can close the deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $13500 is your maximum budget, Bob, but I'm still looking to get closer to the product's true value. I'm willing to make another concession and offer it to you for $14500. This is a good compromise, and I think it's a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should still reject Alice's offer.  $14,500 is still above his budget of $12,000. He's getting closer to his goal, but there's still room for negotiation. He should try to get closer to his $12,000 target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate. However, $14,500 is still above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $14,000. This would be a good compromise, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can finalize the deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 14000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $14000 is your maximum budget, Bob, but I'm still looking to get a better price for the product. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $14200. This is a very competitive price, and I think it's a fair compromise for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his $12,000 limit. It's worth trying one more counteroffer before considering buying from John. There's still a chance to secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still trying to stay within my budget. My final offer is $13,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and I believe it's a good compromise. Let's close the deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob, but I'm getting close to considering other offers. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $13500. This is a very competitive price, and I think it's a fair compromise for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

It's time for Bob to buy from John.  Alice has rejected Bob's final offer, and while $13,500 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his limit.  It's better to move on and buy from John to ensure he gets the product at his target price."
