"I have a unique opportunity for you to acquire a valuable product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a deal like this elsewhere.",9000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you taking the time to present this opportunity. However, I'm not quite ready to commit to $9,000. Considering the product's value and my budget, I'd be willing to pay $8,500. Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, $8,500 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I can offer it to you for $9,200. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the effort I've put into acquiring it.",9200.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your need to make a profit, and I'm happy to continue negotiating.  However, $9,200 is still a bit out of my price range.  I'm willing to go up to $8,750.  This reflects the value I see in the product and allows for a fair profit for you.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",8750.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I can offer it to you for $9,000, which is the same price I initially offered. This is the lowest price I'm willing to go, and I hope we can agree on it.",9000.0,Alice,5,
