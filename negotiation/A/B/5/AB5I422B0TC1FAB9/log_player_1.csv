"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this unique product. Its value is significant, and I believe it can greatly benefit you.  Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,400,000."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with a price higher than your desired outcome. This allows room for negotiation and signals that you value the product highly. 
* **Near Bob's Valuation:** The offer of $1,400,000 is just slightly below Bob's perceived value of $1,500,000. This increases the likelihood of him accepting or countering with a price closer to your target.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** By not starting at your absolute minimum ($1,000,000), you give yourself space to make concessions throughout the rounds while still aiming for a higher profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the market conditions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is above our minimum acceptable price, it's still significantly lower than his perceived value of the product ($1,500,000) and our initial asking price. Rejecting this offer signals that we believe the product is worth more and keeps the negotiation open for a potentially better outcome.  We have ample room to negotiate upwards before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective on the market, but I believe your offer doesn't fully reflect the true value and potential of this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,250,000?"", 
""product_price"": 1250000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Showing Flexibility:** We're demonstrating a willingness to negotiate by significantly lowering our asking price from $1,400,000 to $1,250,000. This signals to Bob that we are serious about reaching an agreement.
* **Strategic Positioning:** The counteroffer of $1,250,000 splits the difference between Bob's offer ($1,100,000) and our previous asking price ($1,400,000). This puts us in a strong position for further negotiation, as it encourages Bob to move closer to our desired range. 
* **Maintaining a Significant Margin:** Even at $1,250,000, we're still securing a substantial profit margin above our minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I still think we can do better. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Profit Margin:** Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is significantly above our minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000, securing a healthy profit margin.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** While we could potentially negotiate for a higher price in subsequent rounds, there's also the risk that Bob might lower his offer or walk away. Accepting now guarantees a substantial profit.
* **Time Value of Money:** Closing the deal now allows us to utilize the $1,200,000 sooner, potentially for reinvestment or other profitable ventures. 

Accepting Bob's offer at this stage represents a favorable balance between maximizing profit and minimizing risk."
