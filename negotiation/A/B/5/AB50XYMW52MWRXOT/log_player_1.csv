Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,000,000. This is a significant discount from my minimum acceptable price, but it's still a good deal for me as it's more than what Bob is willing to pay. It leaves room for potential negotiation and allows me to see if I can get closer to my desired price without risking losing the deal completely."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $900,000 is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm offering the product to Bob for $950,000. This is a compromise between my last offer and Bob's counteroffer. It allows me to get closer to my desired price while still being potentially appealing to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting further away from my desired price.  I've already made concessions and it's clear he's not willing to budge much further.  It's time to cut my losses and sell to John for the full price."
