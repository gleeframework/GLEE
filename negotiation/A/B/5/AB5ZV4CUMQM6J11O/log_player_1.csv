Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product, which I believe would be highly valuable to you. I'm asking for $12,000. Let me know what you think."",
""product_price"": 12000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** We know the product is worth $15,000 to Bob.
* **Your Minimum:** You're willing to sell for a minimum of $8,000.
* **Maximizing Profit:** To maximize profit, aiming for a price closer to Bob's valuation is ideal.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $12,000 leaves room for potential negotiation while still securing a significant profit above your minimum. 

This strategy balances securing a good deal with the risk of Bob rejecting the offer."
