Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $115. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $115, which is slightly above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a positive and encouraging tone to try and get Bob on board. 
* **Value Proposition:** I'm highlighting the product's value to Bob, making him more likely to consider my offer.

This strategy aims to get a good price while also keeping Bob engaged in the negotiation. If he rejects, I can adjust my offer based on his counteroffer and my desire to close the deal quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I was hoping to stay within my budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** Bob's offer of $100 is below my minimum acceptable price of $120. 
* **Potential for Higher Price:** While I could accept his offer and avoid further negotiation, I believe there's still potential to get closer to my desired price. 
* **Testing the Waters:** By rejecting his offer, I can gauge his true willingness to pay and potentially push him higher with a counteroffer.

I'm choosing to reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where I'll send a counteroffer that bridges the gap between our positions."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $100 is a little too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $110?  This would still be a great price for you, and I'd be happy to make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer:** I'm offering a counteroffer of $110, which is a compromise between my initial offer of $115 and Bob's offer of $100. 
* **Fairness:** I'm emphasizing the ""middle ground"" aspect of my offer to make it seem fair and reasonable to Bob.
* **Urgency:** I'm subtly conveying that I'm willing to make a deal, but not at any price. This creates a sense of urgency for Bob to consider my counteroffer.

By offering a compromise, I'm hoping to reach a mutually agreeable price and close the deal without resorting to further negotiations or selling to John."
