Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $120 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested, but I'd be willing to pay around $60 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Bob's offer:

Explanation: Bob is stubbornly staying below his true valuation. It's unlikely we'll get a much better offer from him. We have a guaranteed sale at $100 with John, which meets our minimum. It's time to move on."
