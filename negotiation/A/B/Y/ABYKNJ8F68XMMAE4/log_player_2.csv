(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

The product is far too expensive at $1,800,000. It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm starting with a lowball offer of $1,000,000. This is my maximum price, and it's likely Alice will counter. We'll see how the negotiation goes from here."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,350,000 is closer to my budget, I still think I can get it lower. I'll try one more counteroffer before considering buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}

I'm offering $1,250,000, which is a slight increase from my last offer.  I'm hoping this shows I'm willing to compromise, but I'm still not willing to go much higher."

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

Alice is not budging much, and we are running out of time.  While I'd prefer to get a better deal, it's not worth risking losing the product entirely. I'll buy from John for $1,000,000 to ensure I get the product."
