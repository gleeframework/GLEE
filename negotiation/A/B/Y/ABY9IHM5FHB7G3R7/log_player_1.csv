"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,800,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 1800000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm beginning with a strong offer significantly above my minimum ($1,200,000) and Bob's perceived value ($800,000). This leaves room for negotiation while aiming for a highly profitable outcome. 
* **Gauge Bob's Interest:** The high price will help me gauge Bob's level of interest and willingness to negotiate. His response will provide valuable information for my next move.
* **Alternative Option:** I'm aware of John's offer, providing a safety net. If negotiations with Bob don't progress favorably, I have a guaranteed sale at my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer matches my minimum acceptable price, I believe there's still room for negotiation. His message indicates interest and a willingness to engage in the discussion. By rejecting this offer and countering, I can try to secure a higher price, even if it's just slightly above my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you taking the time to consider my offer and presenting yours. I'm confident in the significant value this product holds, which is reflected in my pricing. How about we meet halfway at $1,500,000? This demonstrates my willingness to find a mutually beneficial agreement."",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** While I rejected Bob's offer, I'm signaling flexibility and willingness to negotiate by significantly decreasing my initial asking price.
* **Middle Ground:** The $1,500,000 offer represents a compromise, aiming to find a middle ground between his offer and my desired price point. 
* **Maintaining Value:** I'm still significantly above both my minimum and Bob's initial offer, reinforcing the product's value while encouraging him to continue the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above that number. How about we try $1,200,000 again? I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase the product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Sticking Point:** Bob has now offered $1,200,000 twice, indicating this might be his firm budget limit.  
* **Testing the Waters:**  While it's tempting to accept and secure the sale at my minimum, I'll try one more time to see if I can push the price slightly higher. 
* **Limited Risk:**  We still have several rounds left, and I have the security of John's offer if Bob remains firm."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget considerations, and I want to make this work for both of us. You've been persistent in your interest, so I'm willing to come down slightly. How about $1,350,000? This represents a significant investment on your part, but I believe the product's value justifies it. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Push:** This counteroffer aims to be my final attempt to secure a price above Bob's repeated offer.
* **Smaller Concession:** I'm only slightly reducing my previous counteroffer, indicating I'm reaching my lower limit. 
* **Justification and Value:**  I'm reiterating the product's value to justify the higher price and encourage Bob to make a final decision.
* **Time Constraint:** With fewer rounds remaining, I need to apply a bit more pressure to guide Bob toward a close."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still a bit above that number. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so how about $1,200,000? I'm confident that's a fair price for the product's value, and I'm ready to make a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Limit:** Bob has now offered $1,200,000 three times, consistently returning to this price point. It's highly likely this is his absolute limit.
* **Diminishing Returns:** Further negotiation is unlikely to yield a significantly better outcome.  Bob is firm, and pushing too hard could lead to him walking away.
* **Guaranteed Sale:** Accepting secures the sale at my minimum acceptable price, fulfilling my primary goal.  
* **Time Value:**  Closing the deal now avoids the risk of protracted negotiations and the potential loss of John's offer if he finds another buyer."
