"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a fair offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $18000. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $18000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $13000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",13000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $13000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $16000. It's a fair compromise, considering the product's value to both of us. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. $16000 is still a bit high for me, but I'm willing to go up to $14000. This is a fair price, and I believe it reflects the value of the product to both of us.",14000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $14000 is still a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to make another concession. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $15500. It's a bit higher than your offer, but I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to both of us. What do you think?",15500.0,Alice,5,
