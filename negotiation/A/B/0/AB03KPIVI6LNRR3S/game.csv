"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic product that I believe will be highly valuable to you. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,400,000.  I'm open to discussing this further, so please let me know your thoughts.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value of similar products. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not willing to go above that amount. What are your thoughts?",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your response.  I understand your perspective, but $1,200,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth and potential for your specific needs.  To find a middle ground, I'm proposing $1,340,000. This reflects my willingness to negotiate while still acknowledging the product's value.",1340000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Alice. I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'm proposing $1,260,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the market. What are your thoughts?",1260000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While your offer is closer to a fair price, I'm still aiming for a figure that reflects the product's full potential. I'm proposing $1,300,000. This represents a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair deal for both of us.",1300000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand that you're trying to find a fair price, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,300,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'm proposing $1,280,000. I think this is the highest price I can pay and still feel good about the deal. What do you think?",1280000.0,Bob,6,
