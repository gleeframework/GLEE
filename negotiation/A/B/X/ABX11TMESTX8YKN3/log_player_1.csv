Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the significant return on investment you'll gain."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's maximum valuation ($1,200,000) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $1,100,000 leaves some space for Bob to counter-offer, potentially still landing us above our minimum acceptable price.
* **Justify the Price:** Highlighting the product's value and Bob's potential ROI helps justify the high price tag.

**Important Considerations:**

* This strategy assumes we have no information about Bob's negotiation style or financial constraints. 
* There's always a risk that Bob will reject the offer, leading us to accept the lower price from John. However, aiming high initially gives us the best chance to maximize our profit."
