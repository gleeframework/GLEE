Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic opportunity to purchase [product name]. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000.  I believe this reflects the true worth of what's being offered. Let me know if you have any questions or would like to discuss further."", ""product_price"": 1200000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:**  Since we know Bob values the product at $800,000, starting significantly higher allows room for negotiation while ensuring we don't leave money on the table. 
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes the ""value"" of the product without being overly specific. This leaves room for Bob to justify the high price to himself.
* **Backup Plan:** We have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $800,000, so there's less risk in aiming high with Bob.

**Important Note:**  This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob based on his response. The goal is to find a price point that is significantly above your minimum but still appealing enough for him to accept."
