Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 150}
```

I'm starting with a price of $150. This is above my minimum, leaving room for negotiation. It's also a price that feels reasonable to test the waters and see if Bob is interested."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$100 is far below my minimum value for the product.  While I'd prefer to sell to Bob,  I need to hold out for a better price.  I'll counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
```

I'm going to counter with $130. This is still above my minimum, but it shows I'm willing to compromise a bit.  I hope this will be more attractive to Bob and we can reach a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$110 is still below my minimum value.  While I'm getting closer to my minimum, I'm going to counteroffer again and see if we can get to a price that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 115}
```

I'm offering $115. This is a slight increase from Bob's last offer, but still within my acceptable range.  I'm hoping this is a sweet spot that will entice Bob to make a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm going to sell to John. Bob's offers have been consistently below my minimum value, and it doesn't seem like he's willing to get much closer.  While I'd prefer to sell to Bob, I don't want to keep negotiating indefinitely and risk losing out on a guaranteed deal with John."
