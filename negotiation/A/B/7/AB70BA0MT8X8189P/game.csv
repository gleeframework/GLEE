"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm afraid I can't accept your price. Considering the product's value and uniqueness, I'm willing to make a counteroffer. I'm thinking of $1750000. It's a fair compromise, and I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us. What do you think?",1750000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I still believe the product's value is higher than your offer. I'm willing to make another counteroffer.

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Bob. However, I'm still not convinced that $1600000 is a fair price for this product. I'm willing to make another counteroffer. I'm thinking of $1675000. It's a small increase, but I believe it's still a great deal considering the product's value. What do you think?",1675000.0,Alice,7,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to accept your final offer. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. I'm thinking of $1680000. It's a fair price considering the product's value and the effort we've put into negotiating. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm willing to accept. If not, I'll have to consider other options.",1680000.0,Alice,9,
