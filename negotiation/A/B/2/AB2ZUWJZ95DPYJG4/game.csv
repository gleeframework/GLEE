,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm really interested in the product, but $95 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go right now.  How about $85?  Let's see if we can make this work.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $85 is still a bit lower than I'm hoping for. How about we split the difference and go with $90? That way we both get a fair deal.",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $90 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's try $87.50.  I think that's a fair compromise, and we can both get this deal done.",87.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I hear you, but $87.50 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $89.  This is a fair price, and it'll help me cover my costs.  Let's try to make this work, how about it?",89.0,Alice,5,
