Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product, and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm offering it to you for $100. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation by:

* **Establishing a friendly tone:**  ""Hi Bob, I think you'd really appreciate it"" helps build rapport.
* **Setting a reasonable starting price:** $100 is above your minimum but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Leaving the decision to Bob:**  ""What do you think?"" encourages Bob to respond and engage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of a price around $90. Would you be willing to meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $90 is higher than John's offer of $80.  Since my goal is to earn as much money as possible, accepting Bob's offer is the best choice at this point."
