""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000.  I believe this is a fair offer considering the significant return you stand to gain."", 
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we have a guaranteed $1,000,000 from John, our goal is to get the highest price possible.
* **Understanding Bob's Value:** Bob values the product at $1,500,000, meaning he has a potential profit margin of $500,000.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $1,350,000 still allows Bob a sizable profit margin of $150,000, while securing us a significantly higher profit than our fallback option. 
* **Exclusivity:**  By framing the offer as ""exclusive,"" we add a sense of urgency and value, potentially influencing Bob's decision."
