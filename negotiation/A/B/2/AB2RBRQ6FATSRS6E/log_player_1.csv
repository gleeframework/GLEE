"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a fantastic deal for both of us, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset for your business. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's slightly higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.  This is a good starting point to see if we can find a mutually beneficial price within the 10 rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but your price is a bit high for me. How about we settle for $800,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum value of $1,500,000. I'm willing to negotiate, but I won't accept such a low price. I'll counteroffer in the next round to see if we can find a more acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I understand you're looking for a good deal, $800,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about we try $1,000,000? This price still allows for a profit for me and a significant value for you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
