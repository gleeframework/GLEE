"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob, so Alice's initial offer of $1,300,000 is too high. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000} 
``` 

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $1,100,000. This is a significant reduction from Alice's initial price, but still leaves room for negotiation. It's important to start with a strong counteroffer to show Alice I'm serious about getting a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 
Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is the maximum price Bob is willing to pay, and matches John's offer.  There's no advantage to continuing negotiations."
