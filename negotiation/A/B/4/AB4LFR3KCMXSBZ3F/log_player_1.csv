Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its immense value, I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and potential for you."", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Stakes:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,000,000, you can afford to be ambitious with Bob.
* **Testing the Waters:**  Starting with a significantly higher offer ($1,500,000) allows you to gauge Bob's eagerness and potentially secure a much larger profit. 
* **Room for Negotiation:**  Even if Bob rejects the initial offer, it opens the door for negotiation. He knows you value the product highly, and you have room to come down to a price that's still significantly above your minimum.

This strategy maximizes your potential profit while keeping the guaranteed $1,000,000 from John as a safety net."
