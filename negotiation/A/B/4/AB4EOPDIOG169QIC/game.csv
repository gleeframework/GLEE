"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $10,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to compromise. How about $11,500?  This price still allows me to make a fair profit, and I believe it's a reasonable price for the value you'll get from this product. Let's make this deal happen!",11500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  How about we split the difference and settle at $10,750?",10750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $10,750 is still a little below my minimum.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $11,250?  This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair outcome for both of us. Let's finalize this deal!",11250.0,Alice,5,
