"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $10,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Could you do $6,500?",6500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints.  While $6,500 is too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $8,500.  This still gives you a good deal, and it's closer to what I need.  Let me know if you're interested in moving forward at this price.",8500.0,Alice,3,
