Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm using a friendly and encouraging tone to build rapport and increase the chances of a deal.
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffers:**  This price gives Bob enough room to counter without feeling like he's being taken advantage of. 
* **Focus on Value:** I'm emphasizing the product's value to Bob, hoping he'll see it as a good investment."

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,500. That's the highest I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.** 
* **I have 10 rounds and can still get a better deal.** I want to see if I can push for a price closer to my ideal value. 
* **Selling to John right now would be a guaranteed $12,000.** However, I'm willing to risk a few more rounds to see if I can get a higher price from Bob."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $10,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and I offer you the product for $11,000?  It's still a fantastic price for a product you value at $10,000, and it gets us closer to a deal."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-offering to reach a middle ground:** This shows I'm flexible and willing to negotiate, while still protecting my minimum acceptable price.
* **Highlighting value and benefits:** I emphasize the value of the product to Bob, hoping it will encourage him to accept.
* **Positive and encouraging tone:** Maintaining a friendly and collaborative tone to keep the negotiation moving forward."

# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above $10,000. How about we meet in the middle at $10,750? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.** 
* **I have 6 rounds remaining and can still potentially get a higher price.**  I'm not yet at the point where selling to John is the most profitable option.
* **I want to continue to negotiate and see if I can push Bob closer to my desired price point.**

I will counteroffer Bob in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $10,750 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again. How about $11,000?

```

**Reasoning:**

* **Continuing to meet in the middle:**  I'm showing flexibility while still protecting my minimum acceptable price.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm starting to think we're not going to meet in the middle anytime soon. I'm willing to go up to $10,900, but that's as high as I can go. Please let me know if that's acceptable to you.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.** While it's getting closer, I'm not ready to accept yet. 
* **I have 4 rounds left.**  I want to see if I can push Bob just a bit higher before considering selling to John. 
* **Selling to John right now would guarantee me $12,000.**  However, I'm still hopeful that I can get a better deal with Bob. 

I will counteroffer Bob in the next round, aiming for a price closer to my desired value."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to come up to $10,900, but I'm still hoping to find a price that works for both of us.  Would you be willing to consider $11,250?

```

**Reasoning:**

* **Staying within my acceptable range:** $11,250 is still above my minimum price point of $12,000.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not willing to go above $10,900. I'm willing to meet you at $10,900, but I need you to meet me halfway. Can you consider that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,900
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is running out:** I have only two rounds left.
* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price:**  I've reached the point where I'm unlikely to get a higher offer from Bob, and my minimum price is still $12,000.
* **Selling to John is the most profitable option:**  It guarantees me $12,000, which is higher than anything I can reasonably expect from Bob at this point.

While it's disappointing to not close the deal with Bob, it's more strategic to secure a guaranteed profit by selling to John."
