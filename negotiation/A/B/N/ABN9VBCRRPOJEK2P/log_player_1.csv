"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 20000} 

I'm starting with a high price, knowing that it's unlikely Bob will accept it on the first round.  This allows me to gauge his interest and start the negotiation process.  I'll be prepared to adjust my offer based on his response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I believe I can get a better price.  While $16,000 is better than my minimum of $15,000, I'm confident that I can push for a higher price with further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
```

I'm counteroffering with $18,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still a good amount for me. I'm hoping that Bob will be willing to meet me halfway.  I'm still aiming for a higher price, but I'm also aware that I need to be flexible in order to make a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer of $17,000. While I would prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, I've already gone through a few rounds of negotiation and it's getting closer to the point where it might be more worthwhile to sell to John for a guaranteed $15,000.  $17,000 is a good compromise, and secures a profitable sale."
