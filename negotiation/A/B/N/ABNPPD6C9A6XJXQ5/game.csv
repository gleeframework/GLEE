"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested in the product, but $130 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $110?",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $130 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $110. How about we meet in the middle at $125? It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",125.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground, Alice.  How about $115? That's a fair price, and I'm ready to buy if you agree.",115.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm still not willing to go as low as $115. I'm willing to compromise a bit more, though. How about we try $122? It's getting close to my minimum price, but I think it's still a fair deal for both of us.",122.0,Alice,5,
