"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that's worth a lot to me. I'm willing to let it go for $175. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $175 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $120? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $120 is better than nothing, it's significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150. I'll try to get closer to that value by making a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $120 is just too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $145? It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 145}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $145 is still a bit too high for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $130? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $130 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still not satisfied with it. I believe there's room for further negotiation and I'm not willing to settle yet. I'll try to push for a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand we're getting closer. How about $135? It's a reasonable compromise that's fair to both of us."", ""product_price"": 135}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to your price, but I still think we can do better. Would you be willing to consider a price of $125? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $125 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  We've been going back and forth for a few rounds now, and it's clear that we are not going to reach an agreement that works for both of us.  It's better for me to take the guaranteed $150 from John than to risk getting stuck with a lower price or wasting more time negotiating with Bob."
