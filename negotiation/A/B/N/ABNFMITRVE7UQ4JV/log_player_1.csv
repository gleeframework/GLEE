"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1500000} 

I'm starting high, aiming for a significant profit.  I want to see if Bob is truly interested and if he's willing to pay a premium. If he's not, I can always fall back on John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum value, but I still believe I can get more. I'm going to counteroffer and try to bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

I'm lowering my price a bit, but still aiming for a good profit. This counteroffer shows flexibility while keeping my expectations high. If Bob rejects, I can continue negotiating or fall back on John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is now very close to my minimum value, and I'm not sure how much more I can get. I'm accepting this offer to secure a sale and avoid risking a further drop in price or a rejection that could lead to a deal with John for a lower price."
