"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential worth, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,150,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts?",1150000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm very interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not comfortable going above that price. What do you think?",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but the value of this product to both of us is significantly higher than $1,000,000.  How about we settle at $1,100,000? This reflects a more accurate valuation while still offering you a great deal.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from our previous offer, so how about we settle at $1,075,000? I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I have a budget in mind.",1075000.0,Bob,4,
