"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm offering the product to you for $11,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you.",11000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer Alice!  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $11,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product.  This is a fair price considering the value to me, and allows for both of us to walk away satisfied.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $10,500. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $10,800. I think this is a fair price considering the value it holds for you, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment.",10800.0,Alice,3,
