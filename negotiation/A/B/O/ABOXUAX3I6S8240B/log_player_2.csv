"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm offering the product to you for $11,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

Bob should reject Alice's offer and try to negotiate a lower price.  He can potentially get a better deal by counter-offering."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $10,500. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $10,800. I think this is a fair price considering the value it holds for you, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  While he can potentially get a slightly lower price by counter-offering, the risk of Alice rejecting his counteroffer and potentially leading to a price higher than $10,800 is not worth it.  At $10,800, Bob is still saving $1,200 compared to buying from John."
