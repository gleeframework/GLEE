**Reasoning:**

While getting $1,350,000 would have been ideal, Bob has shown a consistent pattern of incrementally increasing his offer.  It's unlikely he'll go much higher than $1,325,000. Accepting now secures a significant profit above my minimum ($1,200,000) and avoids the risk of Bob walking away in later rounds."
