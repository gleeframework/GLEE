Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. I think this is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  Bob values the product at $8,000, so $10,000 gives him some room to negotiate.
* **It's below your minimum:** You won't settle for less than $12,000, so you have room to go up if necessary.
* **It's a strong opening offer:**  It shows you are confident in the product's value and are willing to negotiate. 

This strategy allows you to potentially get closer to your goal of $12,000 while still keeping Bob engaged in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, given my budget constraints, I am only able to consider offers within the range of $8000 to $9000. Would you be willing to adjust your offer to meet my needs? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

While $9,000 is closer to your minimum than Bob's initial offer, it's still significantly lower than what you'd ideally like to get.  Rejecting the offer allows you to continue negotiating with Bob, potentially getting closer to your desired price point. 

You can use this rejection as an opportunity to:

* **Explain your rationale:** You can reiterate the product's value and why $9,000 is not a fair price for its worth.
* **Propose a counter-offer:**  You can propose a counter-offer slightly lower than your desired $12,000 but higher than $9,000. This shows flexibility while still advocating for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9,000 doesn't reflect the value of this product. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer.  How about we split the difference and go with $9,500? It's a fair price that acknowledges your needs and also ensures I'm able to make a decent profit."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

This counteroffer is strategically designed to:

* **Show flexibility:**  You've lowered your price from $10,000, demonstrating your willingness to compromise.
* **Present a fair compromise:**  $9,500 is a middle ground between your previous offer and Bob's counter-offer. 
* **Maintain a strong position:**  You're still above Bob's ideal price, giving you room to negotiate further if necessary. 

By proposing this counter-offer, you are demonstrating your commitment to reaching an agreement with Bob while still ensuring you receive a price closer to your desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. Considering my budget and the current market situation, I believe $9000 would be a fair price for both of us. This allows me to stay within my financial limits while still acknowledging the value of your product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob has remained firm at $9,000, and further negotiation seems unlikely to get you closer to your desired price. Selling to John for $12,000 is the best option in this scenario, as it guarantees you your minimum desired value. 

While you could continue negotiating with Bob, it's likely that:

* **The negotiations will be lengthy:**  You've already gone through multiple rounds, and Bob is unlikely to budge significantly.
* **The risk of getting a lower price is high:**  There's a chance Bob will remain steadfast, and you'll be stuck with his $9,000 offer.

It's better to secure a guaranteed $12,000 with John than to risk potentially ending up with a lower price after further negotiation."
