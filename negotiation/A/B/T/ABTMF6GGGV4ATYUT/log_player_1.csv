Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic opportunity to purchase [product name].  Given its value and potential, I believe a price of $1,300,000 is fair. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1300000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Understanding Value:**  You know the product is worth significantly more to Bob than your minimum.  
* **Leaving Room for Profit:** $1,300,000 gives Bob a $200,000 discount (which is significant and might entice him) while still earning you a substantial profit above your minimum."
