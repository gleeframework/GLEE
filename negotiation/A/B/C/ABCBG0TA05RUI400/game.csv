"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  $120 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. How about we meet in the middle at $90?  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",90.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $120 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $90. How about we meet in the middle again, but this time at $110? It's still a good deal for both of us, and I think you'll really appreciate the product.",110.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you being flexible, but $110 is still a bit more than I'm aiming for.  I'm sticking with my offer of $90.  It's a fair price, and I'm confident we can make this work.",90.0,Bob,4,
