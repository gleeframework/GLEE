Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $800,000.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $900,000 is your target price, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to compromise further and offer it to you for $1,025,000. This is a very competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** 

While Alice is coming down, she's unlikely to reach our ideal price point before we run out of rounds.  It's better to secure the product from John at $1,000,000 than risk Alice not going low enough."
