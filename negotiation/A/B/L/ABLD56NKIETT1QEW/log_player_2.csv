"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product, which I believe will greatly benefit your endeavors. Given its high value to you, I propose a price of $12,000 for the product. This offer is exclusive to you and represents a special opportunity to acquire it at a price slightly above its intrinsic value to you ($10,000), ensuring both parties benefit from this transaction. Please let me know if this proposal meets your expectations or if you'd like to discuss further details. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $12,000 is less than her stated value ($15,000), it's still more than your maximum price and what John is offering. By rejecting this offer, you can leverage the standing offer from John and potentially negotiate an even better deal."
