"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you a fantastic opportunity to acquire a unique product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $950,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $950,000 is a better price than John's offer, there's still room for negotiation. It's worth trying to get a lower price from Alice before resorting to John."

# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $850,000 is significantly below my initial assessment. I'm willing to come down slightly to $920,000.  This offer reflects the true value of the product and allows us both to walk away with a fair deal.
