Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1750000} 

This offer is above Bob's perceived value of the product, but significantly lower than your own minimum. This sets the stage for negotiation and leaves room for compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is closer to your minimum, it's still significantly lower than what you'd ideally like.  Rejecting his offer allows you to counter with a price closer to your desired value and potentially reach a mutually agreeable solution."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
``` 
This counteroffer is a compromise, moving closer to Bob's offer but still above his initial counteroffer.  It shows a willingness to negotiate while still maintaining a significant profit margin."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to your minimum, but it's still not ideal. Given the chance to sell to John for a price that meets your minimum, it's more advantageous to choose the certain sale to John and avoid further negotiation with Bob."
