Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500.  It's a great deal for both of us, as it's a fair price for you and a good start for me.  What do you think?

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too high for me. I'm looking to spend closer to $9,000.  Would you consider that?"",

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $9,000 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $10,500?  This would still be a good price for you, while allowing me to get closer to my desired price.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500

We're getting closer, but we can still try to push for a better deal before accepting to buy from John."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $10,500 is closer to my budget, but still a little high.  Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $9,750?"",

}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I hear you - you're trying to get the best deal possible.  But $9,750 is still too low for me.  Let's make a final compromise.  I'm willing to drop my price to $10,250.  This is a good deal for both of us, as it's closer to your budget and allows me to get closer to my target price.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,250

Alice is unlikely to go much lower, and we're already very close to John's price. It makes more sense to buy from John for $10,000 and avoid any further risk of the negotiation failing."
