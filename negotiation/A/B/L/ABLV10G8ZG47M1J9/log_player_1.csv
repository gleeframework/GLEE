{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value. This gives me some room to negotiate while still aiming for a good profit.  I'll keep in mind that I can always sell to John for $8,000 if the negotiations with Bob fall through."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,500. I'm willing to make a serious commitment to buy the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Let me know if that's something you'd be willing to consider. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, I want to see if I can get closer to my initial asking price. Rejecting his offer allows me to counter with a price closer to my target, while still maintaining a good relationship with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and your willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price, but $7,500 is a little too low for me. I'm happy to consider $8,500.  This would still give you a good deal, and it allows me to make a fair profit.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $8,250. I think this is a fair price for both of us, and I'm really interested in making a deal. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to accept. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $8,250 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $8,000.  While I could technically get $8,000 from John, I'd rather make a deal with Bob.  This would give me a little extra profit, and establish a possible future relationship with Bob for potential future transactions."
