"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,500. I'm willing to make a serious commitment to buy the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Let me know if that's something you'd be willing to consider.",7500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price, but $7,500 is a little too low for me. I'm happy to consider $8,500.  This would still give you a good deal, and it allows me to make a fair profit.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $8,250. I think this is a fair price for both of us, and I'm really interested in making a deal. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to accept.",8250.0,Bob,4,
