"Hey Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $180 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only comfortable paying $100. Let me know what you think.",100.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. I can see you're interested in the product, so I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer it to you for $140.",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate you coming down in price, but $140 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $120, which is a fair compromise. Let's see if we can make this happen.",120.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see you're really interested in the product, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I need to make a living, so I'm not quite ready to go all the way down to $120. I can offer it to you for $130, and that's as low as I'm willing to go.",130.0,Alice,5,
