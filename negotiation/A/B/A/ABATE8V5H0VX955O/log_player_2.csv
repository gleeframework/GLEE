{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The product is worth no more than $100 to me, and Alice's offer is far too high. I will reject her offer and try to negotiate a lower price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, offering half of Alice's initial price. This demonstrates my strong interest in the product but also establishes a clear starting point for negotiation."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
