Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $18,500, but I'm still a bit concerned about the price. I'm getting close to buying the product from a competitor, John, who is offering it to me for $10,000. I'd love to do business with you, but I need to make sure it's worth it for me. Would you be willing to meet me at $17,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","This is getting tricky! Bob is playing hardball and using John as leverage. We need to decide if we think Bob is bluffing or if he's really close to walking away.  Let's consider:

* **Profit:** $17,000 is still a decent profit margin. 
* **Risk:** If we push further, Bob might take John's offer.
* **Rounds Remaining:** We have 4 rounds left to potentially negotiate a higher price.

While not ideal, taking the $17,000 now guarantees a profit and avoids the risk of losing the sale altogether.
