"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. I think it would be a great asset to you. I'm asking for $19,000, which reflects its true value and potential. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $19,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $19,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

Alice's offer is way above your budget and even higher than its value to her. You can get the product for a much better price from John."
