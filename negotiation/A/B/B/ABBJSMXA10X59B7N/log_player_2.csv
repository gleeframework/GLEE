Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,100,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,200,000 and $1,100,000. I'm offering it to you for $1,150,000. This is still a great deal, considering the product's true value to you is $1,000,000. I'm open to further negotiations, but I'm not willing to go any lower than this.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your desire to get the best deal possible, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,075,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm offering it to you for $1,125,000. This is still a great deal, considering the product's true value to you is $1,000,000. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm willing to finalize the deal.

It's time to switch to John.  Alice is very unlikely to go below $1,100,000, and even at that price, Bob is overpaying. John offers a guaranteed price of $1,000,000, which meets Bob's needs perfectly."
