"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000.  It's a fantastic opportunity for you, and I'm confident you'll find it incredibly valuable.  This is a one-time offer, so don't hesitate to make your decision. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is at the maximum price you're willing to pay.**  You're not gaining any advantage by accepting her offer.
* **John is offering the same price.** This means you have no reason to go through the negotiation process with Alice. 
* **It's more efficient to simply buy from John.** You achieve the same outcome (owning the product for $1,000,000) with less hassle."
