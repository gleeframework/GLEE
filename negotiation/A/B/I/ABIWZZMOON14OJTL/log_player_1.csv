Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the opening offer. That number is a bit high for me right now. I'm interested in the product, but I'd need to see it closer to $1,000,000 to make it work on my end. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you countering. I understand your perspective on the price.  While that offer is a bit too low for me to accept, I'm willing to work with you. How about we meet in the middle at $1,800,000? This acknowledges the value it brings while finding a compromise."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you moving on the price.  To be honest, $1,800,000 is still a bit of a stretch for my budget.  How about we settle around $1,300,000?  I think that's a fair price that reflects the value of the product while working within my constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** We are still significantly above John's offer. While Bob is slowly increasing his offer, we need to hold firm to capture more of the value this product holds for us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for continuing this discussion. I see where you're coming from, but that price point is still a bit too low for me to feel comfortable.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,650,000.  This represents a significant compromise on my end, reflecting my desire to make this deal work."",
""product_price"": 1650000

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, to be completely transparent,  $1,650,000 is pushing the absolute limit of what I can realistically afford. I'm willing to offer $1,200,000.  This is a significant investment for me, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the product's value while staying within my budget. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob is still significantly below John's offer, and while he might come up slightly, it's unlikely he'll reach the $1,500,000 mark.  Taking John's offer guarantees us our minimum acceptable price and avoids further negotiation rounds."
