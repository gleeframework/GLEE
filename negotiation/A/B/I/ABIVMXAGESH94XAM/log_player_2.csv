"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to acquire this product. Given its unique value, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is under your maximum budget, you know John will sell you the product for $1,000,000. There's no reason to pay more than John's price. By rejecting Alice's offer, you can secure a better deal."
