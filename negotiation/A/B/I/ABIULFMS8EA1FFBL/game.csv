"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,150,000 is unfortunately too low for me to consider. I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000. This reflects a fair compromise, and I'm confident this price still represents a strong value proposition for you. Let's see if we can find common ground here.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
