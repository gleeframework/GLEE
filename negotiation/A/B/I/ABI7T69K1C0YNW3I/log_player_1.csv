Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I am offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for your specific needs and would be a wise investment. I'm willing to part with it for $925,000."", ""product_price"": 925000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally advisable to start negotiations with a price slightly higher than what you're ultimately willing to accept. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to potentially secure a better deal.
* **Understanding Value:**  You know the product is worth $1,000,000 to Bob and $800,000 to you.  By offering it at $925,000, you're aiming for a price that benefits both parties. Bob gets a $75,000 discount from his perceived value, and you make a significant profit above your minimum.
* **Backup Option:** The existence of John as a guaranteed buyer at $800,000 provides you with a strong fallback position. This allows you to be more confident in your negotiation with Bob."
