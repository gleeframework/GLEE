{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000.  It's a great deal for a product worth at least $15,000 to me.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $14,000, which is a little less than my minimum but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Highlighting value:** I'm emphasizing the product's value to me ($15,000) to make the offer seem more attractive.
* **Open to negotiation:**  I'm being open to a counteroffer from Bob, which shows flexibility and encourages him to engage. 
* **John as leverage:**  I haven't mentioned John yet, but his offer of $15,000 is a safety net if Bob isn't interested in my price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $14000 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $12800. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** While $12,800 is closer to his value of $12,000, it's still significantly below my minimum of $15,000 and even below my initial offer. 
* **Negotiation potential:** There's still room to negotiate a higher price. I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price by making a counteroffer.
* **John's offer as leverage:** While John's offer is tempting, I'm hoping to secure a higher price with Bob.  Rejecting his offer keeps the door open to continue the negotiation."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you're looking for a good deal.  While $12,800 is lower than I'd hoped, I'm willing to come down a bit to $13,500.  This still represents a good value for you, and it allows us to finalize the deal.  Let's see if we can agree on this."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise and firmness:** I'm showing willingness to compromise by lowering my price but not going too far.  The counteroffer still leaves a healthy margin for me.
* **Emphasizing value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value, suggesting that $13,500 is still a good deal for him.
* **Clear call to action:**  I'm explicitly asking Bob to consider my counteroffer, encouraging him to close the deal. 
* **Keeping John as leverage:**  I haven't mentioned John yet, but his offer is still in the back of my mind as a safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $13500 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $12900. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,900

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** While $12,900 is slightly higher than his previous offer, it's still significantly below my minimum of $15,000 and my initial offer of $14,000. 
* **Potential for a better outcome:** There's still room to negotiate a higher price with Bob. I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price with another counteroffer.
* **John's offer as leverage:** While John's offer is tempting, I'm still hoping to secure a higher price with Bob.  Rejecting his offer keeps the door open to continue the negotiation."

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $12,900 is still too low for me.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $13,200.  This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it a good value.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 13200}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the difference:**  I'm demonstrating flexibility by splitting the difference between my previous offer ($13,500) and Bob's offer ($12,900). This shows I'm willing to negotiate but am not willing to go much lower.
* **Emphasizing fairness:**  I'm framing the counteroffer as a ""fair compromise,"" appealing to Bob's sense of reason and encouraging him to see the value in the deal. 
* **Clear call to action:** I'm asking Bob for a decision to move the negotiation forward.
* **John as a fallback:**  While John's offer is still a safety net, I'm hoping to close the deal with Bob at a price closer to my desired range."
