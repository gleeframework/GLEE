"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice, but I think $20,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $15,000 for it, considering its value and features. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your perspective on the price. While $20,000 represents its true value, I'm willing to come down to $18,000. This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges the product's worth while still making it a good deal for you."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $18,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $16,000 for the product. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While $16,000 is getting closer to our minimum acceptable price, we still have room to negotiate and try to secure a higher amount from Bob. We are willing to go lower, but we'll counter to see if we can get closer to $17,000."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we split the difference and settle at $17,000?  That feels like a fair compromise to me."",

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, Alice, but $17,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $16,500 for the product. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Bob is unlikely to go much higher, and we're already above our minimum acceptable price. Accepting $16,500 secures a good deal and avoids the risk of continuing negotiations and potentially losing out."
