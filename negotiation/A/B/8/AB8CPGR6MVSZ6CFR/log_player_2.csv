"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great product at a competitive price of $14,000. I believe it will be very valuable for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $14,000 is a good price, Bob can potentially get a better deal by rejecting Alice's offer and counter-offering.  Since Bob's maximum budget is $15,000, there's room to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm interested, but $14,000 is a bit higher than I'm hoping for.  I'd be willing to pay $13,000 for the product.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but the product is quite valuable, and $13,000 is a bit too low for me. Could you do $13,750? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $13,750 is a good deal for Bob. He can still save money compared to buying from John, and it's likely that further negotiation might result in a lower offer from Alice, but it's not worth the risk of losing the product altogether."
