"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to sell it to you for $950,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's worth to you is $1,200,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $950,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $800,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $900,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the original price I was willing to accept. I'm confident you'll find it a reasonable compromise.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the counter offer. I appreciate you coming down, but $900,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go. How about we settle at $850,000?  That seems like a fair compromise to me.",850000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. I'm proposing $875,000, which is still a compromise, but closer to my original price. I'm confident you'll find it a reasonable offer.",875000.0,Alice,5,
