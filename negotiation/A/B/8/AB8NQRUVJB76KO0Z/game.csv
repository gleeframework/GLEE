"Bob, I have a fantastic product that I believe will be a great asset to you.  It's worth at least $15,000 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for a price that's fair for both of us.  How about $12,000?  This is a great opportunity to acquire a valuable product at a very attractive price.",12000.0,Alice,1,
