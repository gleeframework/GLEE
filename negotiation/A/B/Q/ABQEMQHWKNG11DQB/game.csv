"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product at a special price of $180. I think it's a great deal for both of us!",180.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $180 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $100 for it.  Let me know what you think.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob! I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I can offer it to you for $140. What do you think?",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $140 is still a bit high for me.  I'm really interested in this product, but I can only go up to $120. If you're willing to meet me there, we have a deal.  Let me know.",120.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to get a good deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $120. I can offer it to you for $130, and that's my final compromise. What do you think?",130.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. I'm still not quite there at $130. How about $125? That's a fair price for both of us, and it would allow us to close the deal. What do you say?",125.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go any lower than $130, Bob. I've already compromised quite a bit. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway between $125 and $130, so I can offer it to you for $127.50. That's my last offer.",127.5,Alice,7,
