Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this incredible product.  I know you'll recognize its true value.  How about we make this deal happen for $1,500,000?"",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Stakes:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,000,000, you can afford to be ambitious with your initial offer to Bob.
* **Testing the Waters:** This offer significantly exceeds Bob's perceived value. However, it allows you to gauge his eagerness and potentially secure a much higher profit.
* **Negotiation Room:** Even if Bob rejects this initial offer, it opens the door for negotiation. You can then gradually lower the price, staying well above your minimum acceptable price."
