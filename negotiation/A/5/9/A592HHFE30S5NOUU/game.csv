"Alice,  $1500000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm really interested in this product, but I'd be willing to pay $1000000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1000000 is a significant amount, but I'm not willing to go that low. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $1250000. It's a fair price considering the product's value and rarity. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1250000 is still a bit higher than my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $1100000.  This is my final offer, so please let me know if you're able to accept it.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1100000. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer, and that's $1200000. It's the highest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm willing to make a deal.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
