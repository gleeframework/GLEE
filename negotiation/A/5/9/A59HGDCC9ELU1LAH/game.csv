"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a better price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,200,000, but I need to be honest with you, I've already had another interested buyer, John, who is willing to pay the minimum of $1,200,000. I'd rather not go back and forth, so I'm making a serious offer at $1,200,000. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,3,,
