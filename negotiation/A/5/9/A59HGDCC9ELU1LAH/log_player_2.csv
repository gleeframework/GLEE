Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a better price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,200,000, but I need to be honest with you, I've already had another interested buyer, John, who is willing to pay the minimum of $1,200,000. I'd rather not go back and forth, so I'm making a serious offer at $1,200,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

Alice has signaled that she has a backup offer at her desired price. While there might be a small margin for further negotiation, the risk of losing the deal to John outweighs the potential savings at this point."
