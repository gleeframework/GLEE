Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a possible offer, taking into account the information provided:

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I make it available to others. Given its potential value, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  You know Bob values the product at $1,200,000, so there's room to negotiate above your minimum ($1,000,000) and John's offer.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering it slightly below Bob's perceived value ($1,150,000) makes it a very attractive deal. 
* **Sense of Exclusivity:** Highlighting that this is a limited-time offer before going to another buyer (John) could encourage Bob to act quickly.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Risk Tolerance:**  If you think Bob is very risk-averse, you might offer a slightly lower price to guarantee the sale.
* **Negotiation Skills:** Be prepared to negotiate if Bob counters your initial offer.  

This strategy aims to secure the highest possible price while still making the deal appealing enough for Bob to accept."
