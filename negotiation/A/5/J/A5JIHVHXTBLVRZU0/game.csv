"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $120 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay. I'm happy to pay $90 for the product. What do you think?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $120 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $90. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $105.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $105 is still a little high for me.  How about $100? That's my final offer, and I'm ready to close the deal right now.",100.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $105 is still a bit too high for you, but I'm not willing to give up yet. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $102.50. This is my final offer, and I'm willing to close the deal if you accept.",102.5,Alice,5,
