"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand you're looking to spend a bit less, but I'm still confident that the product is worth more than that. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm going to counter with a price of $1,100,000. Let me know if that's more in line with what you're looking for.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  I'm still a bit hesitant at $1,100,000.  How about we split the difference and I offer $1,000,000? This would allow you to make a good profit while still providing me with a significant saving.",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. I'm not willing to go as low as $1,000,000, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle again. I'll counter with a price of $1,050,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
