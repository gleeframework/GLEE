"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am excited to offer you our premium product, which I believe would greatly benefit you. Given its value and the fact that it's worth $15,000 to you, I propose a special offer. For a limited time, you can acquire this product for $14,000. This represents a significant savings compared to its full value and ensures you secure an exceptional deal. Please let me know if you're interested in proceeding with this offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $14,000 is tempting, she's clearly trying to inflate the product's value to you.  You know you can get it from John for $15,000. It's worth seeing if Alice will lower her price further."
