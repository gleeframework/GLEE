{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $120. I think it's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's higher than my minimum value of $80 but leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows for a deal that benefits both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. I've done some research and I think that's a more reasonable price for me. Can you meet me at $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While Bob's offer is higher than what John is offering, it is still lower than my desired value.  I will try to get a better price by counter-offering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer and I see your point, but $90 is a little too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $100, which is still a great deal for you considering the value you place on the product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down to $100, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $95. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $95 is higher than John's offer of $80, and is close enough to my desired value that I'm willing to accept it."
