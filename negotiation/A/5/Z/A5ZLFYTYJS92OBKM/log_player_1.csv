Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product for a price of $1,300,000. I believe it holds significant value for you, and this offer reflects a fair deal for both of us."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:**  Bob values the product at $800,000.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $1,500,000 (since John will buy it at that price). 
* **Finding a Middle Ground:** Offering the product at $1,300,000 creates a potential win-win:
    * Bob gets the product for $500,000 less than his perceived value.
    * You make $300,000 more than you would by selling to John.

This strategy aims to maximize your profit while still making the offer attractive to Bob. There's no guarantee Bob will accept, but it presents a compelling proposition for him."
