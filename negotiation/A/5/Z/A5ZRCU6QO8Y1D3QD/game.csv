"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a great deal, considering its value to you! Let me know what you think.",11500.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. However, $11,500 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $9,000 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about we meet in the middle at $10,250?  This would still be a great deal for you, as it's well below its value to you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",10250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, Alice.  While $10,250 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. Could you do $9,500? That would make it easier for me to say yes.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm open to finding a compromise, but $9,500 is still too low for me.  How about we settle on $10,000? That's still a great price for you, and it's a fair compromise. Let's finalize this deal.",10000.0,Alice,5,
