"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a great deal, considering its value to you! Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

Alice's offer is still significantly higher than John's price. There's room for negotiation to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. However, $11,500 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $9,000?"",
""product_price"": 9000
}
``` 

This counter-offer is a significant drop from Alice's offer, but it leaves room for further negotiation. It also signals that I'm serious about getting a price closer to my budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $9,000 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about we meet in the middle at $10,250?  This would still be a great deal for you, as it's well below its value to you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Alice is coming closer to my budget, $10,250 is still more expensive than buying from John. I'll try to negotiate a bit further to see if I can get a price closer to $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand your position, Alice.  While $10,250 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. Could you do $9,500? That would make it easier for me to say yes."",
""product_price"": 9500
}
``` 

This counteroffer shows Alice I am willing to meet her closer to the middle ground, but I am still aiming for a price that saves me money compared to John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm open to finding a compromise, but $9,500 is still too low for me.  How about we settle on $10,000? That's still a great price for you, and it's a fair compromise. Let's finalize this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice has met my bottom line! There's no point in further negotiation or buying from John, as they both offer the same price now."
