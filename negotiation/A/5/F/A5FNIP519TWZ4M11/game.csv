"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider my offer?",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is still quite a bit lower than what I need to make this worthwhile. Let's split the difference.  How about $1,200,000? It's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my target price.  ",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your position, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,200,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I can only go up to $1,150,000. Can you consider this offer?",1150000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm starting to feel like we're not going to be able to come to an agreement. I'm willing to meet you halfway once more, but that's my final offer. How about $1,175,000? If you're serious about buying this product, this is the best price I can do.",1175000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway again, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,175,000. I'm willing to make one more offer, and that's $1,125,000. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'll consider it a fair deal.",1125000.0,Bob,6,
