"Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $950,000 is still quite a bit lower than what I'm hoping for.  How about we split the difference and go with $975,000? It's a fair compromise and allows us to both walk away satisfied.",975000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I see you're serious about getting this product.  While I appreciate your persistence, $960,000 is still a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle again at $970,000? That would be a good compromise for both of us.",970000.0,Alice,5,
