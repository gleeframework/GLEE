Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the effort. However, I believe we can find a price that works better for both of us. How about $950,000 for the product?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000

I'm aiming for a higher price than $950,000, so I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate further."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $950,000 is still quite a bit lower than what I'm hoping for.  How about we split the difference and go with $975,000? It's a fair compromise and allows us to both walk away satisfied."", ""product_price"": 975000}

I'm still aiming for a price closer to $1,000,000.  While Bob's offer is getting closer, I'm not ready to accept it yet. I'll counteroffer again in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see you're serious about getting this product.  While I appreciate your persistence, $960,000 is still a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle again at $970,000? That would be a good compromise for both of us."", ""product_price"": 970000}

Round 6
Bob's offer:

Bob's offer of $965,000 is closer to my goal of $1,000,000, and we are running out of time.  While it's not my ideal price, it's a reasonable offer that secures a good profit.  I'll accept it."
