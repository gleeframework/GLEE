"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $12,000 is your maximum, there's no reason to accept Alice's offer on the first round. It's likely Alice is willing to negotiate, and you can potentially get a better deal. Rejecting the offer allows you to start the negotiation process and see if Alice is willing to lower her price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Explanation:**

This is a significant counteroffer, aiming to gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate. Starting with a lower price increases the chances of Alice accepting and sets the tone for a potentially fruitful negotiation. It's important to remember that you're aiming to save as much money as possible, but you also want to avoid making an offer too low that it would be unreasonable and make Alice walk away."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has come down slightly, but it's still a relatively high price compared to your counteroffer.  Rejecting the offer allows you to continue negotiating.  You can either make a new counteroffer that's closer to your target, or try to gauge how far Alice is willing to go by making a slightly smaller counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Explanation:**

This counteroffer is a compromise between your initial offer of $10,000 and Alice's latest offer of $11,500.  It shows you are willing to meet Alice halfway, but also demonstrates that you are still committed to saving as much money as possible."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has come down slightly from her previous offer, and we're nearing the halfway point of our negotiations. It's a risk to continue negotiating, as we may not be able to get a better price.  Accepting Alice's offer at $11,750 is a good compromise, saving you $250 compared to John's offer. It's important to remember that you want to buy the product, and the time spent negotiating could be used to enjoy the product."
