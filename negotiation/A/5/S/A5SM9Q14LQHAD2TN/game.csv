"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value of this product, $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it, as that's my maximum budget.  Let me know if that works for you.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still confident that the product's value to you is higher than $8,500. Considering our previous discussion, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10,500. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire this valuable item. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm committed to buying this product, but I need to stay within my budget. I'm willing to go up to $9,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. Let me know if you're willing to consider that price.",9000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I understand that you're committed to staying within your budget, and I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer. However, considering the product's value to you is $8,000, I'm still not willing to sell it to you for $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer it to you for $9,750. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire this valuable item. What do you think?",9750.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate. While I see the value of this product, $9,750 is still above my budget. I'm committed to buying, but I need to stick to my maximum of $9,250. This is a significant increase from my previous offer and demonstrates my serious interest in purchasing the product. I hope you can consider this offer.",9250.0,Bob,6,
