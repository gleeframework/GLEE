"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic product at the incredible price of $14,000.  This is a steal considering its value and potential. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is too high. There's a good chance you can negotiate a lower price, closer to her value of $12,000.  You're willing to walk away at $15,000 (John's price), so you have room to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $14,000 is a bit too high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $12,500?"",
 ""product_price"": 12500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aiming lower:**  Starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's asking price (but still above her perceived value) leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Justification:** By suggesting you're meeting ""in the middle,"" you imply flexibility while anchoring the negotiation closer to your desired price range.
* **Polite and collaborative:**  Maintaining a positive and respectful tone encourages Alice to continue the negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest, Bob. While $12,500 is a fair offer, the true value of this product is considerably higher. I could consider letting it go for $13,500. This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Good Deal:**  Alice has come down in price, and $13,500 is a reasonable compromise. It saves you $1,500 compared to buying from John. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Pushing further risks Alice walking away, forcing you to buy from John at the higher price. 
* **""Final Offer"" Tactic:**  While Alice might not actually walk away, her statement adds pressure. It's often better to secure a good deal than to risk losing it for a potentially small gain."
