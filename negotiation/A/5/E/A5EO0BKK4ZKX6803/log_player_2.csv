"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1200000. This is a fair price considering its value to you, and I'm willing to make a concession to get the deal done. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is significantly lower than Bob's maximum budget, so it's worth exploring if a better price can be negotiated.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to initiate a counteroffer and potentially save even more money."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1000000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $1100000. This is still a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find the product valuable. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

**Explanation:**

Alice's counteroffer is a bit closer to Bob's desired price, but there's still room for negotiation. Bob can potentially save more by rejecting the offer and making a new counteroffer closer to $1,000,000."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your desire to split the difference, and I appreciate your willingness to find a mutually beneficial price. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $1050000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you the product for $1080000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a great deal for both of us.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,080,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $1,080,000 is getting close to Bob's initial counteroffer of $1,000,000.  While Bob could try to negotiate further, the risk is that Alice may walk away and Bob would have to buy from John at a much higher price. Accepting the offer saves Bob $420,000 compared to buying from John, which is a significant saving."
