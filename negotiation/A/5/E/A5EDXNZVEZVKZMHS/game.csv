"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but  $1,100,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $900,000. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm afraid I need to make a bit more than that to meet my minimum requirements. I'm willing to consider a price of $1,050,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be comfortable with.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $1,050,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $950,000. Would that be workable?",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get closer to your target, but I'm still a bit far from my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and consider a price of $1,025,000. This is the best I can do, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this point.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
