"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I'm open to discussing this further and finding a solution that benefits us both.",2300000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. I'd be willing to consider something in the range of $600,000.  Let me know if that works for you.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your interest.  While I appreciate your offer, $600,000 is significantly below its true value. I could consider coming down to $1,900,000. This feels like a fair compromise. What do you think?",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $1,900,000 is still more than I'm comfortable with.  How about we meet in the middle somewhere around $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but my goal is to reach a fair agreement. $800,000 is a significant gap from where we started. I'm willing to drop my price to $1,600,000, but that's my final offer. This offer takes into account the real value of the product. Let me know your decision.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
