Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I believe it would be a great fit for you. I'm offering it to you for $12,000. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above your minimum:** $12,000 is well above your minimum of $8,000, ensuring you make a decent profit.
* **It's below Bob's maximum:**  $12,000 is below Bob's perceived value of $15,000, giving him room to negotiate but still leaving a good margin for you.
* **It opens the conversation:**  The message is friendly and inviting, encouraging Bob to engage in the negotiation. 

This approach balances maximizing your potential profit with the need to keep the negotiation going and avoid losing Bob as a buyer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. Could you do it for $9,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,000 is more than your minimum, it's still significantly lower than your initial offer and leaves less room for profit. You're in a good position because Bob clearly values the product.  By rejecting his offer and sending a counteroffer, you can try to secure a price closer to your initial goal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $9,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $10,500? That way we both get a fair price."", ""product_price"": 10500}
``` 

This counteroffer:

* **Is a compromise:** It meets Bob halfway, demonstrating your willingness to negotiate.
* **Is still profitable:** $10,500 is significantly higher than your minimum of $8,000. 
* **Keeps the negotiation moving:** It shows Bob that you're serious about a deal but are not willing to give in too easily.

By striking a balance between your desired price and Bob's offer, you increase your chances of reaching a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  How about we settle at $9,750? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While $9,750 is still below your initial goal, it's very close.  Given Bob's insistence on $9,750, and the risk of continuing to negotiate and potentially losing him as a buyer, it's better to accept his offer and secure a sale. 

Remember, you're also risking selling to John for $8,000 if the negotiation stalls.  Accepting Bob's offer ensures a higher profit."
