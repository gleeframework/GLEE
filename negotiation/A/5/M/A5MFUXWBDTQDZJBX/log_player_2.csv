"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

You can get the product for $1,500,000 from John, so there's no reason to accept Alice's offer at $1,400,000.  You should try to negotiate with Alice and see if you can get a better price.  You have room to offer a lower price since Alice is willing to sell for $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,200,000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:** Since Alice is willing to sell for $1,000,000, a counteroffer of $1,200,000 is a reasonable starting point. It leaves room for negotiation and is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer.
* **Balance:** This offer is also significantly lower than your maximum budget of $1,500,000, giving you a good cushion if Alice counter-offers.
* **Potential for Compromise:**  This counteroffer could incentivize Alice to compromise as she is likely to want to close the deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Price Improvement:**  Alice has come down from $1,400,000 to $1,300,000, which is a significant improvement over her initial offer. 
* **Near Your Budget:**  $1,300,000 is getting closer to your maximum budget of $1,500,000.  
* **Potential for Further Negotiation:**  While you could reject and try to negotiate further, there is no guarantee you'll get a better price. There's a risk Alice might walk away or counter-offer with a higher price.

**Conclusion:** Accepting the offer at $1,300,000 is a good deal, considering your budget and the potential risks of further negotiation."
