Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. We understand that $1,200,000 is a bit above your budget, but we're not willing to go as low as $600,000. Considering the product's value to you, we're willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,000,000. Let's see if we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. We understand that you're serious about the product, and we're willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial price. However, we're not willing to go as low as $700,000. Considering the product's value to you, we're willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This price reflects a compromise between our initial offer and your counteroffer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** 

Alice is very slowly lowering her price. It's unlikely she'll reach a price close enough to your $800,000 limit in the remaining rounds.  You can get the product immediately from John at your target price, making it the best option."
