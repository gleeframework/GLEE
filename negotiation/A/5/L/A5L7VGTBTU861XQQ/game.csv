"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $600,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",600000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but I think $600,000 is a bit high. Would you be willing to come down to $450,000?",450000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that the product is worth more to you than $450,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $550,000. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you.",550000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While I agree the product is valuable, I'm working with a tight budget. Would you consider $500,000? That's the highest I can go.",500000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $500,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $525,000. This is the lowest I can go and still make a profit. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you.",525000.0,Alice,5,
