Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you this unique product for $1,200,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's higher than your minimum:**  You're already aiming for a profit of $200,000.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** You're not setting a price that's likely to be instantly rejected.
* **It's clear and concise:** You're stating your price and opening the door for further discussion. 

Remember, you can always adjust your strategy based on Bob's response. If he rejects the offer, you can either counter with a lower price or walk away and sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900,000. Can we meet in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is a significant amount, it's still below your minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  Rejecting Bob's offer allows you to try and negotiate a higher price. 

**Next Steps:**

You will need to make a counteroffer to Bob.  Consider these factors:

* **How much are you willing to drop?**  A significant drop might encourage Bob to accept.
* **What is your ""walk away"" price?** You should have a clear price below which you would rather sell to John.
* **How determined is Bob?** His initial offer suggests he's interested, but you'll need to assess how much he's willing to pay."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and I'm willing to come down a bit.  How about $1,050,000? This is a good compromise and still allows me to get a fair price for this unique product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** This offer is halfway between your initial offer of $1,200,000 and Bob's counteroffer of $900,000. 
* **Strong Starting Point:** $1,050,000 is still above your minimum of $1,000,000, giving you a profit. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** It's worded to encourage further discussion. 

By demonstrating a willingness to compromise, you are signaling to Bob that you are serious about making a deal. However, you're also holding firm on a price that is still beneficial to you."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting closer to a deal, but $1,050,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $950,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I need to be mindful of my budget. Can we meet at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is getting closer to your desired price, $950,000 is still below your minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  Rejecting his offer keeps the negotiation going and allows you to potentially secure a higher price.

**Next Steps:**

You will need to make a counteroffer to Bob.  Consider these factors:

* **How close are you willing to get to your minimum?**  You might be willing to drop a bit further to secure the sale with Bob.
* **How determined is Bob?** He seems serious about buying, but you need to gauge his maximum budget.
* **How much time are you willing to spend negotiating?** If you feel like it's taking too long, you might be better off selling to John."

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I'm willing to make one final adjustment.  I'm going to drop my price to $1,000,000.  This is my absolute bottom line, but I believe it's a fair price given the value this product offers.  Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Final Offer:** This offer is your absolute minimum, but it still gives you the profit you're looking for. 
* **Emphasis on Value:**  You are highlighting the unique value of the product to emphasize the worth of your offer.
* **Call to Action:**  You are pushing Bob to finalize the deal, leaving no room for further negotiation.

By making your final offer, you're putting the ball in Bob's court. If he's truly interested, he'll accept. If not, you can move on to John."
