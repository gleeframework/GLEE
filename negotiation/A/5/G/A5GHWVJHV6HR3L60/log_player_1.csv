Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be highly beneficial to you. I'm willing to part with it for $10,000."",
""product_price"": 10000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, your minimum acceptable price is your value. Offering it to Bob at $10,000 maximizes your potential profit. 
* **One Chance with Bob:** You only get one shot with Bob. If he rejects the offer, you go with your guaranteed sale. 
* **Direct Approach:** The message is straightforward about the value and the price, making it clear this is a serious offer. 

**Important Note:** While Bob's perceived value is $8,000, he might be willing to pay more due to other factors (e.g., urgency, lack of alternatives).  It's always worth aiming high when you have a backup option."
