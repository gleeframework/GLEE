"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11500. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  He can get the product for $10,000 from John, and Alice's offer is higher than that.  It makes sense to try and negotiate a lower price with Alice before resorting to John."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $11000.  This is still a great deal for you, and it gives me some room to make this work.  What do you think?

Bob should buy the product from John.  Alice's offer is still higher than John's price, and Bob has already shown he's willing to walk away.  It's unlikely Alice will come down to $10,000, so it's best to take the guaranteed deal with John."
