Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product at a price of $19,000. I know it's a significant investment, but I believe its value will become clear to you.  Let me know what you think."", 
""product_price"": 19000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Alice knows she has a safety net with John ($15,000). It's strategic to start high to see if Bob is willing to pay more than his perceived value.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The $19,000 offer leaves room for potential negotiation if Bob counters. Alice can gradually decrease the price, aiming for the highest possible amount above her minimum. 
* **Justifying the Price (Subtly):** The message hints at the product's value without revealing Alice's true minimum price.

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Depending on Bob's response, Alice can adjust her strategy in subsequent interactions."
