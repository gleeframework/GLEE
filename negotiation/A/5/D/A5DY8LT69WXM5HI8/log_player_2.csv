"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

This is a clear case of rejecting the offer. $1,300,000 is well above your budget and there is no reason to accept such a high price. It's better to negotiate with Alice and try to reach a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 600000}
```

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer at $600,000. This is a substantial discount from Alice's initial price, but still leaves room for negotiation. I'm aiming to push Alice towards a more reasonable price point while remaining within my budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,000,000 is better than Alice's initial offer, it's still above my budget. I'll continue to negotiate with Alice to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 700000}
```

I'm raising my counteroffer to $700,000. This is closer to my budget and shows Alice that I'm serious about getting a deal.  It's also within the range of what I'm willing to pay."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$950,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. While we are getting closer, I want to see if I can push Alice a bit lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

I'm raising my offer again to $850,000.  This is getting very close to my limit, but I believe there's still room for Alice to come down a bit.  If she rejects this offer, I'm prepared to buy from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

At this point, Alice has repeatedly rejected offers close to my limit. With only 3 rounds remaining, the risk of not reaching a deal with Alice is too high.  It's time to take the sure thing and buy from John for $800,000."
