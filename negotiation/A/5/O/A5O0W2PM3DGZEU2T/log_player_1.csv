**Reasoning:**

While Bob is slowly increasing his offer, it's clear he's trying to stay well below my minimum. At this point, the potential gains from continuing to negotiate with Bob are outweighed by the risk of him not reaching a price I find acceptable. John offers a guaranteed $1,500,000, which ensures I meet my minimum and avoids further time and effort in the negotiation process."
