"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think $2,000,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,600,000 for it. Can you consider this price?",1600000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your interest and counter-offer. I understand your perspective on the price.  While the product's value is quite significant, I'd be willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $1,800,000?",1800000.0,Alice,3,
