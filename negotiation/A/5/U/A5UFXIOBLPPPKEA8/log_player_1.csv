Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product before I list it publicly. I believe it would be highly valuable to you.  I'm willing to let it go for $12,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 12000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed sale at $15,000, aiming higher with Bob first gives me a chance to earn even more.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $12,000 is a significant discount from my guaranteed price, making it more appealing to Bob. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  While my initial offer is $12,000, there might be room to negotiate slightly if Bob counters. However, I won't go below a price that makes selling to John the more profitable option."
