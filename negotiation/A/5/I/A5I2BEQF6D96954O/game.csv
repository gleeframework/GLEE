"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $15,000 is outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for it, which is a fair price considering its value to me.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your interest and counter offer. I understand your perspective on the value.  While $10,000 is too low for me to accept, I'm willing to come down to $13,500.  I believe this price reflects the true worth of the product.",13500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $13,500 is still beyond my budget. I'm willing to go up to $11,000, but that's my absolute limit.  Let me know if this works for you.",11000.0,Bob,4,
