"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $15,000. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer of $15,000 is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $10,000.  It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $15,000 is outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for it, which is a fair price considering its value to me."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your interest and counter offer. I understand your perspective on the value.  While $10,000 is too low for me to accept, I'm willing to come down to $13,500.  I believe this price reflects the true worth of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down in price, $13,500 is still above my maximum budget of $10,000. It's worth trying to negotiate further with Alice before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $13,500 is still beyond my budget. I'm willing to go up to $11,000, but that's my absolute limit.  Let me know if this works for you."", ""product_price"": 11000}
