"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you. I'm confident this is a win-win situation. What do you think?",1750000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,750,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need at least $1,550,000 to make this deal work.  This price still leaves room for profit for you, and I believe it reflects the value of the product. What do you say?",1550000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're looking for a price closer to $1,550,000. While I see the value in your product, I can't justify going that high. How about we meet in the middle at $1,375,000? This offer represents a fair compromise for both of us.",1375000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1,375,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $1,450,000, which is a fair compromise considering the value of the product.  This price still gives you a good deal, and it allows me to get closer to my target. Let's seal the deal at $1,450,000.",1450000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting closer.  I'm willing to stretch my budget to $1,400,000. This is my final offer - it's a reasonable price, and I'm ready to close the deal today if you're agreeable.",1400000.0,Bob,6,
