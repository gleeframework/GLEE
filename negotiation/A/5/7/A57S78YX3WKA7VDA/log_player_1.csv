{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you this unique product for $1,000,000. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer but I'm not quite there yet.  $1000000 is a bit steep for me at the moment. I'm willing to pay $750000 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
It's too early to accept Bob's offer.  While $750,000 is a decent amount, it's still below my minimum value. I'll see if I can get a better offer from Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $750,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need at least $900,000 to make this worthwhile.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $900000 is closer, but I'm still stuck at $800000 for now.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer of $800,000 is my minimum value, and I'm running out of time.  It's time to accept his offer and close the deal."
