"Alice, I appreciate the offer but I'm not quite there yet.  $1000000 is a bit steep for me at the moment. I'm willing to pay $750000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $750000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need at least $900000 to make this worthwhile.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $900000 is closer, but I'm still stuck at $800000 for now.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",800000.0,Bob,4,
