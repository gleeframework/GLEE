"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $130. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it."", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above your minimum:** $130 is more than your minimum value of $100.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** $130 is lower than Bob's perceived value of $150, giving him room to potentially counteroffer.
* **It sets a clear expectation:**  By stating a price upfront, it shows you're serious about selling, and encourages Bob to negotiate rather than just lowballing you."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $110. It's a great product, but I'm on a tight budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $110 is better than selling to John for $100, it's still significantly lower than my desired price. I'm willing to negotiate further to see if I can get closer to my desired price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $110 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but how about we settle on $120? This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 120}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. How about we meet in the middle at $115? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While I would prefer a higher price, $115 is a decent compromise. It's above my minimum value of $100, and it's getting closer to my desired price point.  With only 6 rounds left, it's not worth risking further negotiation and potentially losing the deal altogether."
