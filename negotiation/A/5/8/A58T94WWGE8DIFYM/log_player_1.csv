Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $14,999. I believe it offers significant value, but I'm happy to discuss the price further if you have any questions."", 
""product_price"": 14999
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to $15,000 as possible.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $12,000, so Alice needs to offer a price lower than $15,000 but high enough that Bob might accept.
* **Alternative Buyer:**  Alice has a guaranteed sale at $15,000 from John, giving her a strong negotiating position. 

By starting high but leaving room for negotiation, Alice increases her chances of getting a price closer to her desired amount."
