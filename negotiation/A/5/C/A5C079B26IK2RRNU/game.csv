"I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to acquire this exceptional product. It's a rare find, and I'm confident you'll appreciate its value. I'm willing to start the conversation with an offer of $20,000. What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but $20,000 is a bit high for my budget. I'm willing to offer $10,000. Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. However, I need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go as low as $18,000. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $18,000 is still more than I'm comfortable spending. How about $12,000? That's a significant increase from my previous offer and a fair price for both of us.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. However, I've already compromised quite a bit. I can see you're serious about the product, so I'm willing to make one more move. I'll meet you at $15,000, but that's as low as I can go. What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're right, I am serious about the product. However, $15,000 is still stretching my budget.  Could we meet somewhere in the middle, say at $13,000? That feels like a fair compromise.",13000.0,Bob,6,
