"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,300,000 is less than what Bob would pay John, there's room for negotiation. Bob can likely get a better price by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,100,000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob starts by making a bold counteroffer.  He wants to push Alice to accept a price significantly lower than her initial offer. This is a good starting point for negotiation, but it's important to be prepared to adjust the price based on Alice's response."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has moved closer to Bob's desired price, it's still above what Bob wants to pay. He can likely get a better deal by continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,200,000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob knows Alice's minimum price is $1,200,000.  He's making a counteroffer at that price, hoping to reach a deal quickly. This is a calculated risk, as Alice might reject it. However, if she does, Bob is prepared to go to John as a last resort."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is not willing to budge from her $1,400,000 offer.  Bob has already tried his best to negotiate a lower price, and this offer is still higher than his ideal price. With only five rounds left, it's not worth the risk of further negotiation.  Buying from John, even at a higher price, guarantees Bob the product and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation with Alice."
