"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Since the product is worth the same to both Alice and Bob, there's no immediate incentive to accept Alice's offer.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to potentially negotiate a lower price.  Even if the negotiation fails, Bob has the option to buy from John at the same price, so there's no downside to trying to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm hoping to pay a bit less. I'm willing to offer $1,000,000 for your product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Explanation:**

This counteroffer starts the negotiation process. Bob is proposing a price significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, aiming to secure a better deal.  The message is friendly yet firm, suggesting a willingness to negotiate while establishing a starting point."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This would still give you a great deal on a product worth $1,200,000 to you. Let's work together to find a price that benefits us both. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $1,100,000 is better than Alice's original price, Bob is still looking to save as much money as possible. Rejecting the offer allows him to continue negotiating and potentially get a better deal. It also signals to Alice that he is serious about getting a lower price. There's no immediate benefit to accepting the offer since Bob has the option to buy from John at the same price if negotiations fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but I'm still hoping for a slightly lower price.  Would you consider $1,050,000?  That's a fair price that gives us both a good deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Explanation:**

This counteroffer continues to push for a lower price while remaining reasonable.  Bob is proposing a price that is halfway between his previous offer and Alice's most recent offer, showing a willingness to compromise.  The message is friendly and focuses on the benefits of the deal for both parties, increasing the chances of Alice accepting."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too low for me.  To be fair to both of us, how about we split the difference and settle on $1,075,000? This is a compromise that gives us both a good deal. Let's finalize this and move forward. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob could continue to negotiate, Alice's offer of $1,075,000 is a good compromise and represents a significant savings compared to both John's price and Alice's initial offer.  Accepting the offer allows Bob to acquire the product at a favorable price and avoid the risk of further negotiations potentially failing. It also demonstrates a willingness to reach an agreement and move forward."
