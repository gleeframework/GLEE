"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This would still give you a great deal on a product worth $1,200,000 to you. Let's work together to find a price that benefits us both.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too low for me.  To be fair to both of us, how about we split the difference and settle on $1,075,000? This is a compromise that gives us both a good deal. Let's finalize this and move forward.",1075000.0,Alice,5,
