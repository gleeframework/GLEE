"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit high for my budget. How about we bring it down to $6,000? That feels like a fairer price to me.",6000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $12,000 might be a stretch for your budget, but I'm still confident that the product is worth a premium. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $9,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value to me.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  $9,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something a bit more budget-friendly. Would you consider $7,000? I think that's a reasonable offer.",7000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a price that works for you, but I'm still not willing to go below $8,500. This is the lowest price I'm comfortable with, considering the product's value to me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle again and offer it to you for $8,500. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",8500.0,Alice,5,
