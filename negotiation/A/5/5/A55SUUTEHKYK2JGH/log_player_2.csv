"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

Since Bob is willing to pay up to $12,000 for the product and Alice's offer is exactly that, it makes sense to accept.  There's no benefit to rejecting and buying from John at the same price."
