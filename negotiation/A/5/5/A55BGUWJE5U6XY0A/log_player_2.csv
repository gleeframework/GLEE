Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer slightly higher than John's price, hoping to entice Alice into negotiation.  This shows I'm serious about buying, but still leaves room for bargaining."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly from the last round. This shows Alice that I am willing to negotiate, but I still want to get the product for less than her initial offer.  I'm hoping she'll see that I'm serious about buying and come down a little more."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1125000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer again, but only by a small amount. This shows Alice that I'm serious about buying but also that I'm not willing to overpay. With only four rounds left, the pressure is on for Alice to make a decision.  I'm hoping this will be enough to get her to accept."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has dropped her price a bit more, but we still have three rounds left. I'm not willing to settle yet, as I believe we can still get a better price.  My goal is to get the product for less than $1,100,000, and I believe that's still achievable."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1110000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer again, but by a smaller amount than before. I'm showing Alice that I'm willing to negotiate but also that I'm getting closer to my limit. With only two rounds left, I need to be more aggressive to get a good deal.  Hopefully, this final counteroffer will be enough to convince Alice to sell at a price that's favorable to both of us."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,130,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,130,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is the final round of negotiations.  Even though Alice's offer is still above my target, it's getting closer to John's price.  Since I'm running out of time, it's likely better to accept this offer and avoid the risk of losing the opportunity altogether.  I might be able to get a slightly better deal with John, but I'm not sure if he's still willing to sell. It's a calculated risk, but accepting this offer seems like the safest option at this point."
