"I'm excited to offer you this amazing product at a special price of $11,000. It's a great opportunity to get a fantastic deal on something that's worth $12,000 to you. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you're placing on the product. However, I'm looking to spend a bit less. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for it.  Let me know what you think.",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to save a bit, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10,500. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you is $12,000. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $10,500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about we split the difference and settle on $10,000?  That would be a fair price for both of us.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'll offer it to you for $11,250. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",11250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to get closer to your minimum, but $11,250 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's meet in the middle at $10,625.  I'm confident we can find a solution that works for both of us.",10625.0,Bob,6,
