"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. It's a valuable asset that could be a significant boost to your operations. I'm confident this price is fair considering the product's worth to you. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $950,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $700,000 is simply too low for me.  It's significantly below the value I'm looking for. How about we meet in the middle at $850,000? This price still leaves room for profit for you, and it's closer to the value I'm seeking.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you're looking for a fair price. How about we settle at $775,000? That's a significant increase from my previous offer and  a good compromise.",775000.0,Bob,4,
