"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $10,000. This is a strategic move to gauge Bob's interest and potentially get him to offer a price closer to my desired range. If he rejects this, I'll adjust my strategy based on his counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $5,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $5,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

$5,000 is far too low for me. I'm willing to negotiate, but I won't accept a price that's so drastically below my minimum.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

I'm reducing my price slightly to $9,000. This shows Bob that I'm willing to compromise while still aiming for a price that is closer to my desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

$6,000 is still too low.  I'm starting to run out of time, but I'm not ready to sell to John yet. I'll make another counteroffer and see if we can reach a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

I'm lowering my price to $8,500. This is a significant concession, but it's necessary to show Bob that I'm serious about making a deal. I'm getting closer to John's offer, so I need to see if Bob is willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

$7,000 is still below my minimum, but I'm getting closer to my goal. I'm running out of time, but I'm not ready to sell to John just yet. I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach an agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 7500}
```

I'm lowering my price to $7,500. This is a significant concession, but it's necessary to show Bob that I'm serious about making a deal. I'm starting to run out of time, so I need to see if Bob is willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While $7,200 is still below my ideal price, it's the best offer I've received from Bob.  I'm running out of time, and I'm concerned that I won't be able to get a better offer before I have to sell to John. It's better to secure a sale than to risk losing out on a deal altogether."
