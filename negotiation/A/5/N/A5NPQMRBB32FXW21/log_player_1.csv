Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,000,000. This is a good starting point, as it's significantly higher than my minimum price of $800,000 and leaves room for negotiation. It also acknowledges that the product is valuable to Bob, but is still a reasonable price considering the potential for him to make a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is closer to my desired price, it's still below what I believe the product is worth. I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

I'm countering Bob's offer with $950,000. This is a compromise, meeting him halfway, but still leaves some room for potential negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer of $925,000. While I would prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, Bob's offer is still a good deal for me, exceeding my minimum price by $125,000.  It's also likely that further negotiation might lead to more rejection and delay, potentially resulting in a lower price or the need to sell to John for $800,000."
