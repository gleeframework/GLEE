Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your desire to save, and I'm willing to negotiate further. However, $1,100,000 doesn't quite reflect the product's true potential.

# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,075,000 is unfortunately below my minimum acceptable price.
