"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I believe that's a fair price considering the value it holds for my business. What do you think?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. While I'm open to negotiating, $900000 doesn't quite reflect the true value of this product for your business.  Let's split the difference - I'm willing to come down to $950000. This allows you to secure a significant advantage and still leaves room for a profitable deal for both of us.",950000.0,Alice,3,
