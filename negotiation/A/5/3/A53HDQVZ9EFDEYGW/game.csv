"I have a great opportunity for you, Bob. I think you'll really love this product. I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,500. It's a fair price, considering its value to you is $10,000. Let me know if you're interested!",9500.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. I'm willing to pay $8,500.  It's a good deal for both of us. Let's see if we can agree on that.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to pay a bit less, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,500. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $9,000. It's still a great deal for you, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you is $10,000. Let me know if this works for you.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. How about we split the difference at $8,750? It's still a good deal for both of us, and we can close this quickly.  What do you say?",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're close, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $8,750. I'm willing to compromise at $9,250. It's still a great deal for you, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you is $10,000. Let's see if we can finalize the deal at this price.",9250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we meet in the middle at $8,875? This would be a fair price for both of us, and we can finally close this deal. What do you say?",8875.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm not quite ready to meet you at $8,875, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $9,000. It's still a great deal for you, and I think it's the best we can do at this point.",9000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your need to get closer to your minimum price, but $9,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $8,900, which is a fair compromise. Let's finalize this deal before we run out of time.",8900.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $9,000. I'm starting to think that we're not going to meet in the middle, and I'm considering other options. I'm willing to make one final offer to you: $9,100. If you're not interested, I'll have to explore other opportunities.",9100.0,Alice,9,
