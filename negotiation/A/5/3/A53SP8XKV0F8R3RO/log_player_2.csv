"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'd like to make you a one-time offer to purchase this exclusive product for $950,000. This is a unique opportunity to acquire a valuable asset that I believe will bring you significant returns. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While you could get the product for $1,000,000 from John, Alice's offer of $950,000 is still a better deal, saving you $50,000.  Even though you might be able to negotiate a lower price with Alice,  the potential gain is not worth the risk of losing the deal and having to buy from John at a higher price."
