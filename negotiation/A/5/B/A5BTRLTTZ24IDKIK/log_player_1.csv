I'm starting with a price of $14,000. This is a good starting point as it's below Bob's perceived value, but still above my minimum acceptable price. I'm hoping to get as close to Bob's maximum willingness to pay as possible without risking him walking away."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While it's closer to my minimum than my initial offer, I still believe I can get a better price.  I'm going to counter with a price closer to my ideal, but still below Bob's perceived value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm counteroffering with $13,500. This is a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's offer, and I believe it's a fair price that still leaves room for both of us to be happy with the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  While it's not ideal, it's still a better outcome than selling to John.  This ensures I'm above my minimum price and minimizes the risk of getting a worse offer later."
