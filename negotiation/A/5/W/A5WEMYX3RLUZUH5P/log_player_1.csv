Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, your goal is to see if you can get more from Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $1,150,000 creates a win-win scenario if Bob accepts:
    * Bob gets the product for $50,000 less than its worth to him.
    * You make a $150,000 profit, which is more than you'd make selling to John.
* **Time Pressure:**  Mentioning ""other interested parties"" creates a sense of urgency, potentially pushing Bob to make a decision quickly.

**Important Note:** This assumes you have no ethical qualms about offering the product at a higher price to Bob than you're willing to accept from John."
