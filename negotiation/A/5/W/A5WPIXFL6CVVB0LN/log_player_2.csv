"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $14,000. I think it's a fair price considering its value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While $14,000 isn't a terrible price, it's still significantly higher than Alice's perceived value of $8,000. There's room for negotiation to get a better deal.  I'm willing to counteroffer and see if I can get closer to $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $14,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $10,500?"",
""product_price"": 10500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Starting with a counteroffer closer to my target price puts the pressure on Alice. It's still a reasonable markup from her $8,000 valuation and gives us room to negotiate further if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest, Bob.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $10,500 is a bit too low for me.  Could you do $13,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice is moving in the right direction, but $13,000 is still closer to her initial offer than mine. I'm willing to push the negotiation a little further to see if I can land somewhere between $11,000 and $12,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand, Alice. I'm willing to meet you halfway - how about $11,500?"",
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  By suggesting we ""meet halfway,"" I'm aiming for a price that feels like a compromise without conceding too much ground. $11,500 is a strong offer that still allows me to save significantly compared to John's price."
