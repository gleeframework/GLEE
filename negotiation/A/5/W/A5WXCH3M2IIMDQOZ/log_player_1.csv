"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1100000} 

I'm starting with a high offer, knowing that Bob values the product higher. This gives us room to negotiate and hopefully settle closer to my desired price.  I'll monitor Bob's response and adjust my strategy from there."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is higher than John's, I'm not willing to settle for that price yet. I believe I can still push for a better deal with Bob, given his higher valuation. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

I'm lowering my price slightly from the previous round to show some flexibility, but I'm still aiming for a price closer to my goal of $1,000,000. This should hopefully make Bob more inclined to accept, while still leaving room for further negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is very close to my desired price and it's getting late in the negotiation. I'm confident that I can't push for much more, and risking another round might lead to him rejecting my counteroffer.  It's better to take the $950,000 and secure the deal."
