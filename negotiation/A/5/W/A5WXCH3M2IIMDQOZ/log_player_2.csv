"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $1,100,000 is within Bob's budget, it's still a significant amount.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to attempt to negotiate a lower price.  There are 9 rounds remaining, giving Bob ample opportunity to try and secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Since there are 9 rounds left,  he can afford to be aggressive. By offering $900,000, Bob is still leaving room for negotiation while offering a price significantly lower than Alice's initial offer.  This counteroffer positions Bob to potentially achieve a good deal while still leaving room to adjust in the coming rounds if necessary."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. While $1,000,000 is a good price, there are still 7 rounds remaining. By rejecting the offer, Bob can potentially negotiate a lower price. This also allows Bob to see if Alice is willing to come down further from her previous offers.  If Alice doesn't budge,  Bob still has the option to buy from John in the later rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming to save as much as possible, but he recognizes that Alice may not be willing to drop much further.  This counteroffer represents a compromise, splitting the difference between Bob's previous offer and Alice's current one. This demonstrates Bob's willingness to negotiate, while still leaving room for Alice to counter if she's willing to come down slightly more."
