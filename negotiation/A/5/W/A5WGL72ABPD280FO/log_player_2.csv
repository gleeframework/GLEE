Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product! I'm excited to discuss the details with you. As a starting point, I'd like to offer you the product for $1,000,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you.

""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm very interested in the product, but $1,000,000 is a bit too high for my budget.  Would you consider a price closer to $650,000?"",

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $650,000. I'd be willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $900,000. This is a compromise that I believe is still fair considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000.

{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $900,000 is closer, but still a bit of a stretch. Would you consider $725,000? I believe that's a fair compromise and would allow me to move forward with the purchase."",

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $725,000 is still a bit of a stretch for me, but I'm willing to make another concession. I'd be willing to sell the product to you for $850,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is coming down on her price, it's clear she's unlikely to reach our target of $800,000. She's set a firm limit at $850,000. Since we have the option to buy from John at $800,000, it's more advantageous to do so and avoid further negotiation rounds."
