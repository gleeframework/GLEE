Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $10,000. I believe it holds significant value and would be a worthwhile investment for you."", 
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than both my minimum ($8,000) and Bob's perceived value ($8,000). This leaves room for negotiation and potential profit maximization.
* **Justification:** While the price is higher, I'm including a message that emphasizes the product's value. This aims to justify the price and potentially persuade Bob.
* **Backup Option:** I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $8,000, ensuring I won't be forced to sell below my minimum.

**Strategy:**

This offer allows me to gauge Bob's interest and potentially negotiate a higher price. If Bob rejects this initial offer, I can gradually lower the price, aiming to settle somewhere between $8,000 and $10,000. I always have the security of John's offer if negotiations fail."
