"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $150 is a bit too high for my budget.  Would you consider a price closer to $80?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand that $80 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can do $110, and that's my final offer on that price. What do you think?",110.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. While $110 is closer, I'm aiming for something under $100.  Would $90 be workable?",90.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $90. I'm willing to meet you at $105, and that's as low as I can go. Let me know if that works for you.",105.0,Alice,5,
