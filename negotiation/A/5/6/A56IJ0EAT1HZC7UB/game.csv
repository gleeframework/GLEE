"I'm excited to offer you this amazing product, and I think it's worth discussing the price. I'm willing to start with a price of $9,500. What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm definitely interested in the product, but $9,500 is a bit high for my budget. Would you consider $7,000?  I think that's a fair price that considers its value to me.",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $7,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer it to you for $8,500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for you.",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down a bit, Alice.  While $8,500 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a little steep for me. How about we settle at $7,750? That feels like a fair compromise.",7750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close, but I still need to make a profit. I can offer it to you for $8,200. This is my final compromise, and I think it's a great deal for both of us.",8200.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  I'm willing to stretch my budget a little further to make this deal happen. Would you consider $7,900? That's the absolute highest I can go.",7900.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to stretch your budget, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable going below $8,500. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I can offer it to you for $8,300. This is my last offer, and I hope we can finalize the deal.",8300.0,Alice,7,
