"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! After considering the market value, I'm willing to offer it to you for $12000. This is a great deal, considering the product's worth $15000 to me. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than John's, it's still above Bob's maximum budget.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $12,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product. This is a fair price that reflects the value I place on it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $10500 is a good price for you, but I'm still not willing to sell it for that low. Considering the value I place on the product, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer it to you for $11500. This is a fair compromise that takes into account your budget and the product's worth to me. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $11,500 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $10,000.  Since Bob is looking to save as much money as possible, it's more advantageous for him to buy the product from John for $10,000."
