"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! After considering the market value, I'm willing to offer it to you for $12000. This is a great deal, considering the product's worth $15000 to me. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $12000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. I'm willing to pay $10500 for the product. This is a fair price that reflects the value I place on it. Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $10500 is a good price for you, but I'm still not willing to sell it for that low. Considering the value I place on the product, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer it to you for $11500. This is a fair compromise that takes into account your budget and the product's worth to me. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,3,
