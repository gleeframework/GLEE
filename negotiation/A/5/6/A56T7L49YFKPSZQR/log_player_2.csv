"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm initially offering it at $1,000,000. I believe this price reflects its true worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's not worth it to accept Alice's offer at this point. The product is worth $800,000 to you, so you need to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer but $1,000,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This reflects the value it has to me, and I believe it's a fair price considering its current market value. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is below what I can accept. This product has significant intrinsic value that I believe justifies a higher price point.  To move things along, I'm willing to come down to $975,000. This is a very competitive offer considering the product's potential. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While Alice's offer is better than her initial one, it's still higher than what you're willing to pay. You can try to negotiate further and see if she'll come down closer to your target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $975,000, but I'm still not quite there.  I'm happy to meet you in the middle at $900,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and it would allow us to close the deal quickly.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see you're serious about this purchase, and I respect that.  However, $900,000 is cutting it too close to my bottom line.  I'm willing to make one final offer at $950,000. This is a firm offer, and I believe it's more than fair considering the value this product brings.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice's offer is $950,000, which is still higher than your target price of $800,000 but less than her previous offers. You have a few rounds left and you can continue negotiating, but there is a risk that Alice will continue to be stubborn and you'll end up with no deal. 

Accepting the offer now allows you to secure the product and leaves you with more money to potentially invest in future deals."
