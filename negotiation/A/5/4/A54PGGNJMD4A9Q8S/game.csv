"Bob, I'm offering you this incredible product for $1,000,000.  It's a steal considering its value to you!  Let's make this happen.  What do you say?",1000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your enthusiasm, Alice, but I'm thinking more along the lines of $900,000. That's the highest I'm willing to go at this point.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're aiming for a lower price, but $900,000 doesn't quite reflect the product's full potential value. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to go down to $950,000.  It's a fair price considering your potential gains.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $950,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $920,000. That's my final offer.",920000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but $920,000 still doesn't cover the true value of this product. I'm firm on $940,000. If we don't come to an agreement soon, I might need to explore other options.",940000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand you're eager to sell, but I'm not willing to go above $920,000. I'm willing to make a small concession, but I need to be at $915,000 or lower to consider the deal. That's my final offer.",915000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $915,000 is still below my minimum.  Let's meet in the middle - I'm willing to go down to $930,000. This is my final offer before I consider selling to someone else.",930000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're trying to meet me in the middle, but I'm still not comfortable with $930,000. I'm willing to make one last attempt to negotiate. I'm thinking of $910,000. That's the lowest I'm willing to go.",910000.0,Bob,8,
