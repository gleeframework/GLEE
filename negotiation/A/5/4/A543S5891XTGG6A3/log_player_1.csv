Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,500,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a price of $1,250,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While I'm eager to find a price point that works for both of us, $1,250,000 is a significant drop.  This product offers substantial value, and I believe $1,400,000 is a more reflective price considering its potential ROI for you. Let's find a way to make this work."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit concerned about the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and propose a price of $1,350,000. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the product's value and my budget. Can we find a way to meet in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is consistently moving towards a reasonable price point, but we're still significantly above his perceived value of $800,000. There's room for negotiation, and I'm willing to push a bit further to see if I can secure a better deal before accepting anything below $1,300,000."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

""message"": ""Bob, you're clearly recognizing the value of this product, and I respect your approach to this negotiation. How about we settle this right now at $1,325,000? This demonstrates my commitment to finding a mutually beneficial agreement.  What do you say?"",

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to find a mutually beneficial agreement. However, I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to make one more concession and propose a price of $1,300,000. I think this is a fair compromise considering the product's value and my budget. Can we meet at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**  Bob has steadily increased his offer and has now reached $1,300,000. This is a solid price, exceeding my minimum by $300,000. While I could potentially push for a bit more, there's a risk that Bob will walk away. Accepting now secures a significant profit and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation."
