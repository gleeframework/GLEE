"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1500000} 

I'm starting high, knowing Bob values the product at $1,200,000. This gives us room to negotiate and hopefully secure a price closer to my desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,100,000 is close to my minimum, I believe I can get a better price with further negotiation. I'm not yet at the point where selling to John is the most attractive option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

I'm reducing my initial price but staying above Bob's offer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate, but I still believe the product is worth more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,050,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not happy with the offer. I'm confident I can push for a higher price, and John is still a viable option if negotiations stall."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

I'm coming down further, but I'm still above Bob's last offer and closer to my desired price. This demonstrates flexibility while also maintaining a sense of value for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is not improving, and we're nearing the end of the negotiation rounds. While I would prefer to get closer to my desired price, selling to John guarantees me my minimum and avoids risking further negotiation failures."
