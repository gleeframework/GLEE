"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this unique and valuable product. Given its immense potential, I'm starting the bidding at $1,300,000. I believe this price accurately reflects its worth."", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High (Anchoring):** By starting significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($800,000) and even my own minimum ($1,000,000), I aim to establish a high anchor. This might make subsequent offers seem more reasonable in comparison.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** This high initial price allows me a buffer to make concessions in later rounds while still staying above my minimum acceptable price.
* **Gauging Bob's Interest:**  Bob's reaction to this first offer will give me valuable information about his level of interest and potential to meet closer to my desired price. 

It's important to note that while John offers a guaranteed $1,000,000, there's potential to earn more with Bob if I negotiate strategically."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of the product, but given my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price closer to what I am willing to pay. My counteroffer is $950,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's counteroffer of $950,000 is a significant jump from his initial perceived value, indicating he's serious and potentially willing to negotiate further. While it's above my $1,000,000 minimum, I believe I can still secure a better deal by continuing the negotiation. John's offer is a good safety net, but I'm not ready to settle just yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you recognizing the value of this product. Your offer is a step in the right direction. To be fair, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about we meet in the middle at $1,175,000?"", 
""product_price"": 1175000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** I'm making a significant concession from my initial offer to demonstrate willingness to negotiate and find a mutually agreeable price.
* **Midpoint Approach:**  By suggesting a price exactly between our previous offers, I'm signaling a desire to find a compromise while still aiming high. 
* **Maintaining Value Perception:** I'm avoiding large price drops that might undervalue the product and create the impression I'm desperate to sell."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. While I understand the value of the product, I am still looking for a price closer to my budget. My counteroffer is $1,100,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is now significantly above my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. While I could try to push for a bit more in subsequent rounds, there's a risk that Bob might walk away or that further negotiation won't yield a substantially better outcome. Accepting this offer guarantees a sizable profit and avoids the risk of losing the sale altogether."
