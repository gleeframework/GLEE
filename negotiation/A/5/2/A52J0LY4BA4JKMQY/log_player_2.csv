"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the product for $900,000. This is a great opportunity to acquire a valuable asset at a price that's still well below its true market value. I understand it's a significant investment, but I believe you'll see a strong return on your investment.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $900,000 is below her perceived value, it's still more than you're willing to pay. You have a guaranteed option to buy the product from John for $800,000.  Rejecting Alice's offer keeps the door open for a potential counter-offer or allows you to proceed with your backup plan and save $100,000."
