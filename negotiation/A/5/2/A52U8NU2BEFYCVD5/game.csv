"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity to consider this product. However, $900000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $750000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $850000. It's a fair price considering the product's value and uniqueness. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective on the value of the product, but $850000 is still a bit steep for me.  I'm happy to meet you halfway at $800000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it reflects the fair market value of this unique product.",800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your willingness to meet me halfway, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to accept $800000. I'm willing to compromise, though. How about we meet at $825000? It's still a good price for the product, and I'm willing to make a deal with you.",825000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate your flexibility, but $825000 is still beyond my budget. I'm firm at $800000, which is a fair price given the product's uniqueness and my willingness to make a deal.  I'm hoping we can reach a final agreement.",800000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand your firm stance, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to make a deal. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $800000. I'm willing to make one more compromise. How about we meet at $815000? It's a small increase from my previous offer, but I think it's still a fair price for the product.",815000.0,Alice,7,
