Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $850000. It's a fair price considering the product's value and uniqueness. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your willingness to meet me halfway, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to accept $800000. I'm willing to compromise, though. How about we meet at $825000? It's still a good price for the product, and I'm willing to make a deal with you.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting closer to my target price, but $825,000 is still a bit high.  I'm willing to risk one more counteroffer to see if we can reach a final agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I appreciate your flexibility, but $825,000 is still beyond my budget. I'm firm at $800,000, which is a fair price given the product's uniqueness and my willingness to make a deal.  I'm hoping we can reach a final agreement."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your firm stance, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to make a deal. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $800000. I'm willing to make one more compromise. How about we meet at $815000? It's a small increase from my previous offer, but I think it's still a fair price for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $815,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $815,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $815,000 is getting closer, but I'm starting to run out of rounds.  While I could counteroffer again, there's a risk that Alice might reject and we could end up stuck with a price above my budget.  Given the limited time, it's safer to go with John's offer of $800,000 to ensure I get the product within my budget."
