"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice, but I'm looking to make a more reasonable deal. Considering the product's worth to you is $1,000,000, I'm willing to offer $900,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price, and I'm willing to compromise to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I understand your perspective, the value of this product is significant, and $900,000 falls short of what I consider fair. I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. This offer represents a considerable compromise on my end and reflects my desire to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,150,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,075,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's worth to you is $1,000,000. I'm eager to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1075000.0,Bob,4,
