"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm really interested in the product, but $175 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying.  How about $140?  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",140.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $175 is a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $140. How about we meet in the middle at $160? I think that's a fair price for this amazing product.",160.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $160 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $150. That's the absolute highest I can go. Let me know if that works for you.",150.0,Bob,4,
