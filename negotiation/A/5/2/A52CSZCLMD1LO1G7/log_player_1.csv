Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on this product. I think it would be perfect for you. I'm willing to let it go for $10,000. What do you say?"", 
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:** Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, I should aim to get at least that much from Bob.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  While my minimum is $10,000, starting at that price leaves no room for negotiation. If Bob is hesitant, I can always come down slightly.

This strategy aims to secure the highest possible price from Bob while ensuring I don't lose out on the guaranteed sale to John."
