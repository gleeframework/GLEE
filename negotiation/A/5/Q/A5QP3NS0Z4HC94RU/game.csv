"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I do appreciate it, $10,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $8,500 is still a bit lower than I'm looking for. I'm willing to come down to $9,500.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's make a deal!",9500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $9,500 is still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $9,000? I'm ready to make a deal at that price.",9000.0,Bob,4,
