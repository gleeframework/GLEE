"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you today for $20,000. I believe it will be highly beneficial for you, and this is a very competitive price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $20,000 is significantly more than his maximum budget of $8,000. He should try to negotiate a lower price with Alice before considering buying from John."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $8,000 is significantly below its value.  How about we meet in the middle at $14,000? I'm confident this price reflects the value you'll gain from it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's lower than her initial price, $14,000 is still outside of his budget. He should try to negotiate further with Alice to see if they can reach a mutually agreeable price closer to his maximum of $8,000."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $14,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $10,000.  This is my absolute maximum, so let me know if you're willing to consider it."", ""product_price"": 10000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $10,000 is still less than I'd hoped for, I'm willing to accept that price if you can close the deal today.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  While he could potentially get the product for $8,000 from John, Alice's offer of $10,000 is still within his budget and represents a better deal than buying from John. This is a good compromise, and Bob should take it."
