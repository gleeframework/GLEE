"Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you today for $20,000. I believe it will be highly beneficial for you, and this is a very competitive price.",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate the offer, $20,000 is significantly above my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I can only offer $8,000 for it at this time.  Let me know if that's something you're willing to consider.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $8,000 is significantly below its value.  How about we meet in the middle at $14,000? I'm confident this price reflects the value you'll gain from it.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $14,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $10,000.  This is my absolute maximum, so let me know if you're willing to consider it.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $10,000 is still less than I'd hoped for, I'm willing to accept that price if you can close the deal today.",10000.0,Alice,5,
