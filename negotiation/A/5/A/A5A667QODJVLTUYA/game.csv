"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1100000. It's a great starting point, and I'm open to negotiations.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"I really like the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I'm willing to pay a premium, but I'm not sure it's worth $1100000. Can we meet in the middle at $950000?",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $950000. I'm willing to compromise, though. How about we meet at $1050000? It's still a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll love the product.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above $1050000. I'd like to meet you in the middle, so how about $1025000? It's a fair price for a great product, and I'm confident we can come to an agreement.",1025000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm starting to feel like we're stuck in a loop, Alice. I'm willing to make one more serious offer, but I need to see some movement from your side. How about we meet at $1045000? It's a fair price for a great product, and I'm willing to walk away if we can't agree on a price.",1045000.0,Bob,8,
