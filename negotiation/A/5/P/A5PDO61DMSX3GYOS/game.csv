"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,800. Can you meet me at that price?",10800.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,800 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about $11,200? That's still a great deal for you, considering the value of the product.",11200.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit short on budget. How about $10,500? I'm willing to meet you halfway.",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working with a tight budget, but $10,500 is still too far below what I need.  Let's try to find a middle ground. I'm willing to drop my price a bit more to $11,000. That's a good compromise, and it ensures we both get a fair deal.",11000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. I'm willing to meet you at $10,750. That's the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair price for both of us.",10750.0,Bob,6,
