"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

There's no reason to accept Alice's offer at this point. You have no information on her bottom line, so there's a chance you can negotiate a lower price. Rejecting her offer allows you to start the negotiation process."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a very low counteroffer of $1,000,000. This is a significant discount from Alice's initial price and is likely to be rejected. However, it establishes my bargaining position and forces Alice to reveal some information about her willingness to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to my desired price, but there's still room for negotiation. I believe I can get a better deal by continuing to counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer by $100,000, showing that I'm willing to compromise but still pushing for a lower price. This keeps the negotiation moving forward without being overly aggressive."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,250,000 is a decent price, I still believe I can get a lower price. Continuing to negotiate allows me to potentially reach an even better deal.  I'm not ready to accept this offer yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1150000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer again, showing flexibility while still pushing for a better price.  I'm getting closer to Alice's offer, and this might be a good compromise point."

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,225,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,225,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her offer again, and we are now at a point where her offer is significantly better than John's.  Accepting at this point is the most financially beneficial option. While there's a chance I could push for a slightly lower price, the risk of losing the deal to John outweighs the potential gains."
