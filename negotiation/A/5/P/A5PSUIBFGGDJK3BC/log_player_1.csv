"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000.  It's a unique opportunity, and I believe this price reflects its value.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** This initial offer allows for back-and-forth negotiation without immediately pushing Bob away. 
* **Focus on value:** I'm emphasizing the product's uniqueness and value to potentially sway Bob's perception. 
* **Setting the tone:** I'm starting with a friendly and open tone to foster a positive negotiation environment."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $1,750,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm thinking closer to $1,100,000.  What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** While I'm willing to negotiate, $1,100,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Leaving room for counter-offers:**  Rejecting this offer allows me to make a counter-offer, potentially closer to my desired price. 
* **Prioritizing potential gain:**  Selling to John for $1,500,000 is always an option, but I'm hoping to see if I can get a better price from Bob through continued negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  Considering the unique value of this product, I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000.  This is a fair price that reflects its worth while leaving some room for both of us to walk away happy.  Let's find a compromise."", ""product_price"": 1600000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moderate counteroffer:**  I'm adjusting my price down from the previous offer, showing flexibility and a willingness to negotiate. However, I'm staying above my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Focus on value:**  I'm again emphasizing the product's unique value to justify my price.
* **Compromise language:**  I'm using language like ""fair price"" and ""room for both of us to walk away happy"" to signal my desire for a mutually beneficial outcome.
* **Maintaining leverage:**  By not dropping the price too much, I'm maintaining leverage in the negotiation and avoiding conceding too much too early."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the value you see in the product, but I need to be mindful of my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $1,350,000? This offer represents a significant investment from my side while acknowledging the product's worth. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:**  While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  
* **Room for further negotiation:** I'm not desperate to sell to Bob, so I can afford to reject this offer and continue negotiating.  
* **Maintain leverage:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I maintain leverage and signal that I'm not willing to settle for a price that's significantly below my value. 
* **Possibility of better offer:**  There's still a chance that I can convince Bob to come up to a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $1,350,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,425,000. This price reflects the product's value and allows for a reasonable profit for both of us.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement on this final offer."", ""product_price"": 1425000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** I'm making a significant concession by moving closer to Bob's offer, demonstrating my willingness to reach a deal. 
* **Final offer framing:**  I'm framing this offer as ""final"" to create a sense of urgency and encourage Bob to accept.
* **Focus on mutual benefit:**  I'm emphasizing that this price allows for a ""reasonable profit for both of us,"" highlighting the win-win potential of the deal.
* **Maintaining leverage:** While I'm coming down on price, I'm still staying above my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000, maintaining some leverage in case Bob rejects again."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is getting close to what I can do.  I can offer you $1,300,000. This is a very serious offer, and I think it's a fair price for both of us.  What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Risk of further concessions:**  While Bob's offer is getting closer, I'm concerned about continuing to make concessions.  If I reject this offer and Bob makes another counteroffer, it's likely to be even lower.
* **Time pressure:** With only 4 rounds left, the risk of not reaching a satisfactory agreement with Bob is increasing.
* **Guaranteed profit:** Selling to John for $1,500,000 guarantees me a profit that meets my minimum requirement.  While I would prefer a higher price, this is the most secure option at this stage.

**Conclusion:**  Given the current situation, selling to John is the best strategic move to ensure a guaranteed profit and avoid potentially losing out on a better deal with Bob due to time constraints."
