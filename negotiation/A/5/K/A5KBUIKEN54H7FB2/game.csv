"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, $800000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $900000. Let me know if that works for you.",900000.0,Alice,3,,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $900000 is closer, it's still a bit high for me. I'm confident I can get a better deal elsewhere.  How about we meet at $850000?  It's a fair compromise and would allow us to finalize this deal.",850000.0,Bob,4,,
