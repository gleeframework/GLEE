"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $110. It's a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer!  $110 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $60?"", 
""product_price"": 60
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  By starting significantly lower than Alice's offer (but above half her value), we signal our interest but also our willingness to negotiate.  
* **Aiming for a Deal:** While we have a $80 maximum, aiming lower gives us room to negotiate up and potentially get a better deal.
* **Polite and Positive:** Maintaining a friendly tone encourages continued negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $60 is just too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $85? This would still be a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Within Budget:** $85 is within our $80 budget.
* **Good Deal:**  Alice met us in the middle, and this price is significantly lower than her initial offer and our maximum. 
* **Avoid Risk:**  Further negotiation might not yield a better price, and we risk Alice withdrawing the offer altogether."
