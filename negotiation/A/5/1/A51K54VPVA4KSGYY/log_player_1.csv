Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a chance to purchase [product name] before I make it available to other interested parties. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,000,000.  This is a unique opportunity to acquire something truly exceptional."",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $1,500,000, you can afford to start high. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially a higher profit. 
* **Justification:** Highlighting the ""value and potential"" of the product helps justify the high asking price.
* **Urgency and Exclusivity:**  By mentioning other interested parties and calling it a ""unique opportunity,"" you create a sense of urgency and scarcity, potentially encouraging Bob to act quickly.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The message doesn't sound like a final offer. By saying ""initially proposing,"" you signal  that you might be open to negotiation.

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes Bob is unaware of John's offer. If Bob knows your fallback option, this approach might be less effective."
