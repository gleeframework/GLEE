"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm about the product, but $18,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $12,000. I can meet you halfway at $14,000. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $14,000 is still a bit high for me.  How about we settle on $13,000? This would be a fair compromise for both of us.",13000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're looking for a fair compromise, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $13,000. I can offer you a slight discount to $14,500, which is still a good deal considering the value the product brings. What do you think?",14500.0,Alice,5,
