Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I think you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $90.,90.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is a bit out of my budget. I'm really interested in the product, but I can only afford $75 right now. Would you be willing to come down to that price?",75.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $90 is a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $75. I'm willing to meet you in the middle and offer it to you for $82.50. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",82.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $82.50 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $80, which is my absolute limit. If you're not able to accept that, I'll have to consider other options.",80.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $80 is your absolute limit, but I'm not willing to sell it to you for that price. I'm willing to make one more offer, and that's $81.50. It's a small increase, but I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",81.5,Alice,5,
