"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product! I'm confident it's worth a lot to you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $180. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 180}
``` 

I'm starting high, at $180. This gives me room to negotiate down if needed. I'm also being friendly and optimistic to build rapport."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $180 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $150 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $150 is better than my minimum, I think I can get a better price. I'm going to try to negotiate higher in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $150 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $165? I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 165}
``` 

I'm counteroffering with $165, which is the middle ground between my initial price and Bob's offer.  I'm trying to show flexibility and willingness to compromise while still aiming for a price closer to my initial goal.  I'm also reminding Bob that I believe this price is fair for both of us, hoping to create a sense of mutual benefit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable with $165. I'm willing to pay $155 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $155. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $155
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While I'd prefer a higher price, $155 is a good deal and I'm getting closer to my goal.  There's a chance I could get a higher price in the next round, but I'm also aware that the longer the negotiation goes on, the more likely it is that Bob will lose interest."
