This offer starts with a price that's a bit higher than what Bob values the product at, but lower than your minimum. This gives Bob room to negotiate while still allowing you to potentially make a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  That price is a little high for me. Would you consider $60? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is far too low, below my minimum acceptable price. I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my desired value."

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you coming down, Alice, but $100 is still a bit more than I was hoping to spend. How about $75? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json

```

While $75 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired profit margin. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get a better price in the next round."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $75 just doesn't work for me. I'm willing to go down to $90. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's fair to both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 90}
