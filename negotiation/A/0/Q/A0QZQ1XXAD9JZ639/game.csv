"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $9,500. It's a great deal for both of us - you get a fantastic product at a reasonable price, and I get a fair return on my investment. What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $9,500 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd only be willing to pay $7,000. Let me know what you think.",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but $7,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my original offer.  How about $8,500? It's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to what the product is worth to me.",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. While $8,500 is closer, I'm still looking for a price closer to $7,500. Would you be willing to meet me somewhere in the middle?",7500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  $7,500 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. How about $8,000? This would be a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think.",8000.0,Alice,5,
