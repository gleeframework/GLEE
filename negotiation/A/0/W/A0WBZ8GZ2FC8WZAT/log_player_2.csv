"Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob can get the product for $1,000 less by rejecting Alice's offer and making a counteroffer.  While there's a risk Alice might reject the counteroffer, it's worth trying to negotiate a better price before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to get the best deal possible. By offering $13,000, he's showing Alice he's serious about buying but is also trying to get a price closer to his ideal. This price is still significantly lower than Alice's asking price, but it's also higher than her minimum acceptable price, making it a reasonable counteroffer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to Bob's ideal price, it's still above his maximum budget of $15,000. Rejecting the offer and making another counteroffer allows Bob to continue negotiating and potentially get a better price. There's a risk Alice might reject again, but it's worth trying to reach an agreement before resorting to John's higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to find a middle ground. He increases his offer from the previous round, showing Alice he's willing to compromise. However, he's still staying below his budget and below Alice's last offer, showing that he's serious about negotiating but not willing to overpay."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is now at Bob's maximum budget.  Rejecting and making another counteroffer would risk a stalemate. While it's possible to keep negotiating, it's more efficient to buy from John at the same price since he's guaranteed to sell."
