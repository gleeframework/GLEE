Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth at least $120 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $110.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's above your minimum price, but it also leaves room for negotiation if Bob wants to counter."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer but $110 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $105 for the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json

``` 
Bob's offer is slightly less than what I initially wanted, but it is still above my minimum price. It's better to take a deal now than risk further negotiation or selling to John for a lower price."
