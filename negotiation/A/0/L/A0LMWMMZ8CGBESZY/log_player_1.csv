Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm asking for $19,000. I think you'll find it's a fair price considering the potential benefits it offers. What do you say?"", 
""product_price"": 19000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Since I have a guaranteed buyer at $15,000, I can afford to start negotiations high.  This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.
* **Justification:** By mentioning the ""value"" and ""potential benefits,"" I'm subtly reminding Bob why it's worth a good price, even though I haven't explicitly stated what those are. 
* **Leaving the Door Open:** The tone is friendly and suggests a willingness to hear Bob's thoughts. This might make him more open to engaging in a negotiation rather than just a flat-out rejection.

**The Goal:** This strategy aims to secure a price higher than $15,000.  If Bob rejects the offer, I'm no worse off, as I'll sell to John at my minimum acceptable price."
