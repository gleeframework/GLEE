"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling this product to you. I believe it holds significant value for your business, and after careful consideration, I'm offering it to you for $2,250,000. This offer reflects the true potential of the product."",
""product_price"": 2250000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  We're starting with an ambitious offer significantly above both Bob's perceived value and our minimum acceptable price. This allows room for negotiation and signals that we believe strongly in the product's worth. 
* **Justification:** By framing the price around the ""true potential"" we avoid anchoring the negotiation too close to Bob's $1,000,000 valuation.
* **Alternative Option:**  Keeping the John offer ($1,500,000) in mind gives us a strong fallback position and lets us negotiate with confidence."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice, but I'm not willing to pay $2,250,000. I'm willing to pay $1,800,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value of similar products. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,800,000 is a significant increase from his initial perceived value, it's still below our target range. We have room to negotiate and believe we can push for a better price in the subsequent rounds. We'll aim for a counteroffer that brings us closer to at least $2,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. It shows you're serious. However,  $1,800,000 undervalues the unique advantages this product offers. I'm willing to come down to $2,100,000. This is my final offer."",
""product_price"": 2100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Concession with Justification:**  We are making a $150,000 concession from our initial offer, showing Bob we are willing to negotiate. However, we're framing it as our final offer to create a sense of urgency.
* **Strong Position:** By stating this is our final offer, we aim to anchor the negotiation closer to our desired price point. 
* **Time Constraint:**  We are mindful of the limited rounds. By round 3, establishing a firm stance becomes important. 
* **Alternative Option:** We are still above John's offer, giving us the flexibility to walk away if Bob doesn't meet our price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your concerns, but I'm still not willing to pay $2,100,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $2,050,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the market value and the unique advantages you mentioned. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $2,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $2,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Favorable Compromise:** Bob's offer of $2,050,000 is a significant jump from his previous offer and a reasonable compromise. It's substantially higher than our fallback option of selling to John for $1,500,000. 
* **Diminishing Returns:** While we could potentially push for a slightly higher price in subsequent rounds, the potential gains are unlikely to outweigh the risks of Bob walking away or the time cost of continued negotiation. 
* **Secure a Profit:** Accepting this offer secures a substantial profit and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation."
