"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for sale. I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $12,000 is better than $15,000, there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $12,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending right now.  I'm willing to pay $10,500.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to save a bit, Bob. I can do $11,500 for you, which is a compromise between our previous offers. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's desired price.**  $11,500 is a significant improvement from $12,000 and is getting closer to Bob's target price.
* **Further negotiation might not be worthwhile.**  While Bob could try for a lower price, it's possible Alice will hold firm or even increase the price again. 
* **Time is a factor.**  Continuing the negotiation could take time and could lead to Bob missing out on the product if Alice decides to sell it to someone else.  It's better to secure the product at a price that's still favorable to Bob."
