Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you a fantastic product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its unique features and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000.  I'm confident this represents a fair deal considering its worth. What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  My goal is to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($1,500,000) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $1,400,000 leaves some space for Bob to negotiate, making him feel more in control of the deal.
* **Strong Alternative:** Knowing I have a guaranteed sale at $1,200,000 (to John) gives me leverage.  I'm not desperate to sell below that price.

This strategy aims to secure the highest possible price from Bob while still making the offer attractive enough to avoid him rejecting it."
