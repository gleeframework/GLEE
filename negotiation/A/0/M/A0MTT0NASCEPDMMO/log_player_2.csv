"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling this product to you.  I believe it holds significant value, and I'm confident it can greatly benefit you. To kick things off, I'm proposing a starting price of $2,000,000.  I'm open to hearing your thoughts and engaging in a productive negotiation. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for starting the conversation. While I agree the product is valuable, that price is a bit high for me. How about we bring it down closer to $1,000,000?  I'm thinking $1,200,000 as a starting point for negotiations."", 
""product_price"": 1200000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** It's generally good negotiation practice to counter a high offer with a significantly lower one. This leaves room for bargaining and signals that you're aiming for a good deal.
* **Respectful Tone:**  Maintaining a positive and respectful tone keeps the negotiation amicable, even while being firm about your price expectations.
* **Target in Mind:** By aiming for $1,200,000, we're still leaving space to potentially meet in the middle while staying well below Alice's initial offer and our $1,000,000 walk-away point (John's offer)."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you engaging in this negotiation.  While $2,000,000 represents the high end of the product's value, $1,200,000 undervalues its potential. Let's try to find a middle ground. How about we consider $1,750,000? This reflects a willingness to compromise while still recognizing the true worth of what I'm offering. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:** 

Alice came down a bit, but we're still far from our ideal price.  We need to signal that her offers are too high and push for a more significant price reduction. We have the option to buy from John as leverage."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me partway, but $1,750,000 is still more than I'm comfortable spending.  To be honest, I've found similar products in the $1,000,000 range. I'm willing to offer you $1,350,000 to keep our negotiation going, but if we can't get closer to that number, I may have to explore other options."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:**  We're making it clear that Alice's offer is significantly above our budget.  The mention of ""similar products"" adds weight to our position.
* **Introducing a Potential Walk-Away:** By suggesting we might ""explore other options,"" we subtly introduce the possibility of buying from John. This gives our counteroffer more leverage.
* **Gradual Increase:** We're increasing our offer slightly to show willingness to move, but not so much that we lose sight of our $1,000,000 target."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a competitive price, and I want to make this deal work for both of us.  However,  the quality and uniqueness of this product set it apart from others you may have seen.  To meet you closer to the middle, I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it's a fair reflection of the value it brings. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting closer with her ""final offer,"" but it's still significantly above our target.  By rejecting this offer, we call her bluff and signal we're serious about walking away if she doesn't budge considerably.  We have a good alternative with John, so the risk is relatively low."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you trying to find common ground, but I have to be honest, $1,600,000 is simply more than I'm willing to pay. I've been carefully considering my options, and I'm prepared to offer you $1,400,000 to get this deal done.  However, I also need to be upfront: if we can't agree on this amount, I'm going to have to go with a different vendor who can meet my budget."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Stronger Language:** We're becoming more direct about walking away, indicating that this is a serious consideration, not just a negotiating tactic.
* **Final Offer:** While not explicitly stating it, this message implies that $1,400,000 is our last offer. This puts pressure on Alice to make a decision.
* **Significant but Reasonable Concession:** We are making a substantial jump in our offer to show Alice we're serious about closing the deal, but only if it's at a price that works for us. 
* **Alternative Solution:** We clearly state that we have another option available (John), further reinforcing our willingness to walk away."
