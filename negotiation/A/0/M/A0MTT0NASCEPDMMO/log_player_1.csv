Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for starting the conversation. While I agree the product is valuable, that price is a bit high for me. How about we bring it down closer to $1,000,000?  I'm thinking $1,200,000 as a starting point for negotiations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:

I'm willing to offer you $1,350,000 to keep our negotiation going, but if we can't get closer to that number, I may have to explore other options.

However,  the quality and uniqueness of this product set it apart from others you may have seen.  To meet you closer to the middle, I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it's a fair reflection of the value it brings."",

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you trying to find common ground, but I have to be honest, $1,600,000 is simply more than I'm willing to pay. I've been carefully considering my options, and I'm prepared to offer you $1,400,000 to get this deal done.  However, I also need to be upfront: if we can't agree on this amount, I'm going to have to go with a different vendor who can meet my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

``` 

While I could push for more, accepting Bob's offer at $1,400,000 is the safest option at this point. Here's why:

* **His language suggests urgency:**  He's mentioning a ""different vendor,"" indicating he's serious about walking away if I don't agree.
* **The gap is narrowing:**  We've gone from a significant difference to a $200,000 gap. It's unlikely he'll move much further.
* **Time is a factor:** We still have a few rounds, but the longer this drags on, the higher the risk of losing him completely.

Accepting secures a significant profit above my minimum and avoids the potential loss of the sale entirely."
