{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting with an offer of $15,000. This gives Bob some room to negotiate while still ensuring I make a profit above my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  I'll see how he responds and adjust my strategy from there."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $14,000 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get closer to my initial asking price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14500}
```

I'm going to counter with $14,500. This is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway. I'm hoping he'll see the value in closing the deal at this price rather than risking further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I'd prefer a higher price, it's getting close to my initial asking price.  Further negotiation risks losing the deal entirely, and at $14,200 I'm still making a decent profit."
