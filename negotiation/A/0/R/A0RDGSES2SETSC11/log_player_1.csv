Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the product's value and the market demand. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, Alice, but I still think $1,025,000 is too high. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so I'll counter with $950,000. Can you consider that?

**Reasoning:** 

Bob is stubbornly sticking to a price far below what we know the product is worth to him.  While he might eventually come up, the risk of him continuing to lowball is too high. We have a guaranteed offer from John at $1,000,000, which is better than Bob's current offer. It's time to cut our losses and take the guaranteed profit."
