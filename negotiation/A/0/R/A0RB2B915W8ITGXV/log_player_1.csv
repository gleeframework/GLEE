Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm willing to go up to $900,000 for the product. I think that's a fair price considering its value to me.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

I'll reject Bob's offer. While $900,000 is closer to my desired price, I believe I can still get a better deal.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."

While Bob's offer is closer to my initial bottom line, I'm concerned about the potential for further negotiations to go down even lower.  John's offer of $800,000 is guaranteed, and I'm not confident I can get a better deal with Bob.  I'll sell the product to John."
