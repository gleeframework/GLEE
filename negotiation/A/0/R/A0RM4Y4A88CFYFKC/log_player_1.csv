Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm offering the product to Bob for $175. This is a reasonable starting point, as it's slightly above the product's worth to him, giving him some room to negotiate.  I'm also keeping in mind that I can always sell to John for $150 if Bob rejects the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low.  While I'd like to close the deal, selling for $130 would be below my minimum price. I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 160}
```

I'm counteroffering at $160. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. It's still a profitable sale for me, and hopefully, Bob will see that it's a fair price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $145
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, Bob's offer of $145 is reasonable. It's above my minimum price of $150, and I'd rather avoid further negotiation. I'll accept his offer and sell the product to him."
