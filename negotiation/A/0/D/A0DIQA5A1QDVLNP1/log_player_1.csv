Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be highly beneficial for you. I'm asking for $14,000, which reflects its value to you. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** My goal is to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($15,000) as possible. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting high allows room for Bob to negotiate down, potentially settling on a price higher than if I started lower.
* **Secure a Quick Sale:** While I have John as a backup, a quicker sale to Bob is ideal. A strong offer might convince him to accept without protracted negotiations.

This strategy balances risk and reward. While there's a chance Bob might reject the offer, the potential for a higher profit makes it a worthwhile gamble."
