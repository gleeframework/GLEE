This offer is a good starting point. It's higher than your minimum but leaves room for negotiation and still allows Bob to feel like he's getting a good deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. Would you be willing to meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price.  $1,100,000 is still too low."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is still a bit lower than what I'm looking for.  How about we split the difference and settle on $1,150,000? This way, we both get a good deal."", ""product_price"": 1150000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,080,000. Would you be willing to meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,080,000

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

Bob is getting too close to my minimum price, and I don't want to risk him continuing to lower his offer.  I'm going to sell to John for $1,000,000 to guarantee a sale and avoid further negotiation."
