Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you first. I think it's something you'll find valuable. I'm asking for $100. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations a bit higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a higher profit. 
* **Gauging Interest:** Bob's response to this initial offer will give you an idea of his interest level and potential willingness to negotiate. If he outright rejects it, you can always adjust your price downwards.
* **Alternative Option:** You have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $80, so there's no risk of losing the sale entirely. This allows you to be more confident in aiming higher with Bob. 
 
Let me know what Bob says, and we can strategize from there! ðŸ˜Š"
