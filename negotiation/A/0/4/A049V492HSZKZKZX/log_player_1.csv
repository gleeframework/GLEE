Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $925,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of the significant benefits it offers. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 925000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Aim high to maximize potential profit, knowing Bob values the product at $1,000,000.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  While starting at $925,000, there's some wiggle room if Bob tries to negotiate down. 
* **Strong Position:**  The message emphasizes the ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""fair reflection"" to reinforce the value proposition. 

This strategy balances ambition with the security of John's $800,000 backup offer."
