"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm still trying to stay within my budget, and $13,000 is still a little high. I'm willing to go up to $12,000 for the product. This is a fair compromise that acknowledges the value you place on it while allowing me to stay within my limits.  Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Bob,4,
