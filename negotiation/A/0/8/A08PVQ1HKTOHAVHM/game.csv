"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, I believe it's a bit too high. Given the product's worth, I'm prepared to offer $950,000.  This is a fair price considering your own valuation and my budget.  I'm confident we can find common ground.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle. Considering the product's value to you and my own valuation, I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's worth and your budget.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. While I see your point about a fair price, $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than what I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000. This reflects the product's value and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement.  I hope we can finalize this deal.",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that we're close to a deal, Bob. However, I need to ensure I get a good return on my investment. Considering the product's value to you and the market, I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,050,000. This is a fair price that balances both our interests and allows us to finalize the sale.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
