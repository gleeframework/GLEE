Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I make it available to other potential buyers. I believe it holds significant value, but I'm willing to part with it for $19,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 19000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing your minimum:** You have a guaranteed sale at $15,000 to John, so you shouldn't accept anything less than that.
* **Bob's valuation:** Bob values the product at $10,000, meaning any offer above that has the potential to be profitable for you. 
* **Aiming high:** Starting with a higher offer ($19,000) gives you room for negotiation. Bob might try to counter-offer, bringing the price closer to his valuation but still potentially above your minimum.
* **Justification:**  The message subtly implies the product's value is higher by mentioning other potential buyers and using phrases like ""significant value"" and ""willing to part with it."" This framing aims to justify the high initial price. 

**Important Note:** This strategy aims to maximize profit. However, a more aggressive starting price might make Bob less likely to engage in negotiation. It's a balancing act between potential profit and the risk of losing Bob as a buyer."
