``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer for now. While $90 is better than nothing, I'm hoping to get closer to my desired price. I'll see if I can negotiate a better deal in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product!  I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $90 is a little too low for me. How about we meet halfway at $105? Let's find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 105}

Round 4

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  While $95 is closer to my desired price, I'm still hoping to get a bit more.  I'll see if I can get him to come up just a little more in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I hear you, but $95 is still a little too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but how about we settle on $100?  This is a fair price for both of us, and I think you'll be very happy with the product.  Let's make a deal!"", ""product_price"": 100}
