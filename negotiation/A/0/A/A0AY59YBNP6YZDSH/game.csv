"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Can you meet me at that price?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $9,000 is tempting, it's still below what I need to make this deal work.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to my asking price.  How about $10,500? It's a fair compromise that reflects the value of the product.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your position, but I'm still a bit far from my target budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,000 and $10,500. How about $9,750?",9750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $9,750 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us both to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",10000.0,Alice,5,
