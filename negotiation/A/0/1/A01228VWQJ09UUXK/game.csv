"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $8,000 is simply too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $10,000? That's a fair price for both of us, considering the value of the product. What do you say?",10000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I'm willing to come down a bit further to $9,750. This is a significant compromise on my end, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us. Let's finalize this deal and avoid any further back and forth.",9750.0,Alice,5,
