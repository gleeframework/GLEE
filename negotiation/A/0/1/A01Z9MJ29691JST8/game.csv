,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $60 is a bit high for me right now. How about $50? I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget.",50.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your budget constraints. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $55? I think it's a fair price for both of us.",55.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $55 is still a little high for me.  Would you be willing to go down to $52? That's a fair price for both of us, and I'd be happy to buy the product.",52.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to make another concession. How about we meet at $53? It's still a bit above your original offer, but I think it's a fair compromise.",53.0,Alice,5,
