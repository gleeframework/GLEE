Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000.  I believe this represents a fair deal considering its worth. Let me know what you think."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to $1,200,000 as possible, knowing John provides a safety net.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high allows for potential negotiation if Bob counters. 
* **Appeal to Value:** The message emphasizes the product's ""unique value"" to justify the price above Bob's perceived worth.
* **Time Sensitivity (Implied):** By stating ""exclusive opportunity,"" Alice subtly implies that Bob might miss out if he hesitates, encouraging a quicker decision. 

This strategy aims to secure the highest possible price from Bob while still making the offer attractive enough to avoid him rejecting it outright."
