Alice's offer:

This is a significant reduction and reflects my desire to find a solution that works for both of us.  Let me know if this works for you, as I'm ready to move forward with John if we can't reach an agreement.

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly holding firm around the $850,000 mark, even threatening to go with another buyer (likely a bluff).  While she *might* come down a little more, it's unlikely to be a significant drop. At this point, the potential savings from haggling further are outweighed by the risk of losing the deal entirely. John's offer of $800,000 is a sure thing and represents a reasonable compromise."
