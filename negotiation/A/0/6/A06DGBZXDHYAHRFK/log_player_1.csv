Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above your minimum:**  You're ensuring you get more than your minimum of $1,000,000.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  Bob values the product at $1,500,000, so there's potential for him to counteroffer and still be happy. 
* **It demonstrates your willingness to negotiate:** By not asking for the full $1,500,000, you show flexibility and encourage Bob to engage.

**Important considerations:**

* **Bob's personality:**  If you know Bob is a tough negotiator, you might consider a lower opening offer.
* **Your time constraints:** If you need to sell the product quickly, you might be more willing to accept a lower price.
* **John's offer:**  Remember, you can always walk away and sell to John for $1,000,000.
