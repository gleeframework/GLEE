Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $900,000. This gives Bob some room to negotiate while still leaving me with a profit.  I'm confident in the value of the product and believe this price is fair, but I'm open to hearing Bob's counteroffer.  If he rejects, I'll consider his counteroffer and continue negotiations.  However, if the negotiation stalls or becomes unproductive, I'll move on to selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

While $850,000 is a good price, I believe I can get closer to my desired price. I'll make a counteroffer to see if we can reach an agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm offering $875,000. This is a compromise, but I'm confident it's a fair price considering the value of the product. It's still a good profit for me, and it's closer to Bob's offer than my initial one. Let's see if we can finally close this deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000.

Bob's offer is a fair price, and I'm happy to accept it. While I initially hoped for a higher price, I don't want to risk losing the deal and having to settle for John's offer."
