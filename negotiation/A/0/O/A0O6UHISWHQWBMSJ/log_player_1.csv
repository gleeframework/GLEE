Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is still a bit too high for me. Given the value of the product, I'm willing to offer $900,000. This seems like a fair price for both of us, as it's significantly lower than your asking price but still above your minimum. Let's see if we can agree on this. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
