"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're working with a tighter budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $800,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. I'm counteroffering at $950,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price for the product's value.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your transparency. However, I'm not willing to go up to $900,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm counteroffering at $980,000. This is as low as I can go, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $980,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** 

Alice is very firm on her price and is unlikely to come down to $900,000. It's clear she's willing to draw this out.  At this point, accepting John's offer of $1,000,000 is the best option.  It saves Bob $80,000 compared to Alice's latest offer and avoids the risk of Alice not budging."
