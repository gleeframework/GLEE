"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm asking for $20,000. I'm open to discussing the price further, so please let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $20,000 is far more than his maximum budget of $8,000.  It's worth seeing if he can negotiate a better price with Alice before buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, $20,000 is way above my budget. I'm really interested in the product, but I can only go as high as $8,000.  Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 8000} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your interest. I understand your budget constraints, but $8,000 is significantly below its true value. How about we meet in the middle at $14,000? This feels like a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $14,000 is a better price than $20,000, it's still higher than his maximum budget of $8,000. It's worth continuing to negotiate with Alice to see if he can get closer to his target price.  If he can't, he can always buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $14,000 is still a bit more than I can comfortably spend.  Would you be willing to go down to $10,000?  That's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10000} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I'm motivated to find a deal, $10,000 is still quite low for what I'm offering.  How about we settle at $12,500? This is my final offer, as I do have other interested buyers. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should buy the product from John.  While $12,500 is tempting, it's still above his budget. Alice has stated it's her final offer, meaning further negotiation is unlikely to lead to a lower price. Buying from John ensures he gets the product for his maximum budget."
