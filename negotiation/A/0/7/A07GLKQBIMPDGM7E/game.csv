"I'm interested in the product, but $2000000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $1400000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",1400000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $1400000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1700000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value.",1700000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $1700000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I was thinking more along the lines of $1500000. Can you consider that price?",1500000.0,Bob,4,
