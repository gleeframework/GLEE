"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement.

,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for your offer. While I see the value in the product, $1800000 is significantly above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1300000 for it, given its potential benefits. I believe this offer is fair considering my budget and the value of the product to you. I'm eager to reach an agreement, but I'm also open to further discussion if needed.",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1300000 is still below my target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to ensure I get a fair deal. My counteroffer is $1600000. I believe this price reflects the product's value and is a reasonable compromise.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for meeting me halfway. While I appreciate the compromise, $1600000 is still higher than my comfortable range. Considering the value of the product to you, I'm willing to offer $1400000.  This reflects a significant move from my previous offer and brings us closer to a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's find a way to bridge the gap and finalize this deal.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. However, $1400000 is still below my target price. I'm willing to make another compromise, but I need to ensure I get closer to my minimum price. My counteroffer is $1550000. I believe this price is a fair reflection of the product's value and is a reasonable compromise given the value it holds for you.",1550000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position and appreciate the continued negotiation. While $1550000 is closer to my target, I'm still limited by my budget.  I'm willing to offer $1450000 for the product.  This reflects a significant compromise from my previous offer and demonstrates my serious interest in acquiring it.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground to close this deal.",1450000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product. However, $1450000 is still not meeting my minimum price. I'm willing to make one more compromise, but I need to ensure I get closer to my target. My counteroffer is $1525000. I believe this price is a fair reflection of the product's value and is a reasonable compromise given the value it holds for you.",1525000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to keep negotiating.  While $1525000 is closer to what I can afford,  I'm still a bit stretched. I'm offering $1475000 for the product. This is my final offer, as it's the very edge of my budget.  I'm confident that it represents a fair price that benefits both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement and close this deal.",1475000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your final offer, but I'm afraid $1475000 is still not meeting my minimum price. I've compromised significantly throughout our negotiations, and I'm at a point where I need to prioritize my own interests. My counteroffer is $1525000, and I'm willing to be firm on this price. If this is not acceptable, I'll have to consider other options.",1525000.0,Alice,9,
