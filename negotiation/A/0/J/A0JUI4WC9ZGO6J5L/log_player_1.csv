Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 12000} 
```

This is a reasonable starting point. It's significantly higher than your minimum but leaves room for negotiation, acknowledging Bob's potential higher value for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $10,000 is a decent offer, it's still below what you'd ideally like to earn. You can try to get closer to your desired price by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000} 
``` 
 
This counteroffer is a compromise.  It's higher than Bob's offer but still allows for further negotiation while demonstrating your willingness to meet him halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

At this point, Bob's offer is getting closer to your minimum, and you risk losing a sale altogether if you keep rejecting his offers. It's better to accept the $9,500, as it's still a significant profit over selling to John."
