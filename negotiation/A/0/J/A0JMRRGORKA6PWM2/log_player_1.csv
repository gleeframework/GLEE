I'm starting high, knowing that Bob values the product at $8,000. This gives me room to negotiate and hopefully secure a price closer to my desired amount. I'm also being friendly and optimistic to encourage a positive response."

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,500. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is lower than my minimum, but he's still interested. I'm going to reject his offer and see if we can find a price that works for both of us in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your offer. However, $7,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little bit to $8,500.
