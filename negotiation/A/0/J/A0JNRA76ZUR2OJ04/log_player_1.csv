{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you.  I'm asking $120 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above your minimum:**  $120 is well above your minimum of $80, so you're already making a profit.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  $120 is still significantly below Bob's perceived value of $150, so he has room to bargain and feel like he's getting a good deal. 
* **It shows you're serious:**  By offering a price that's not just your minimum, you're demonstrating that you're willing to negotiate, but you also have a firm understanding of the product's value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, Alice, but $120 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $100 for it.  Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $100 is better than $80 (what John would pay), it's still below my desired profit margin.  I'm going to counteroffer to see if I can get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer.  While I appreciate you're interested, $100 doesn't quite work for me.  How about we split the difference at $110? It's a fair price for both of us.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 110}
