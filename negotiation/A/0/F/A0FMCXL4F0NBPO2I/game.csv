"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm proposing a starting price of $2,000,000. I'm open to discussing this further, so please let me know your thoughts.",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. However, that price is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your interest. I understand your perspective, but $1,000,000 is significantly below its true value.  I could consider a price of $1,800,000. This feels more in line with what it offers.",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  While I recognize the value, $1,800,000 is still more than I'm aiming for.  Would you consider $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm trying to find a middle ground here.  How about we settle at $1,600,000? That's a significant reduction on my initial offer and represents a fair price.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm getting close to my limit. Could we make it $1,150,000? That's a firm offer from me.",1150000.0,Bob,6,
