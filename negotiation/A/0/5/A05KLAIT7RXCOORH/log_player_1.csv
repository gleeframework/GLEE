Round 2
Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $13,000 is still too high for me.  My absolute maximum is $11,500.  I really want to buy this product, but I can't go higher.  What do you think?

Bob is unlikely to go much higher, and while I could try to negotiate him up slightly, it's not worth risking losing the guaranteed $12,000 from John."
