"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with a price of $12,000, which is a significant discount from its market value. What are your thoughts?",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I agree the product is valuable, $12,000 is a little high for my budget. Would you consider $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a price of $11,000, which is a significant discount from the original price. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  How about we settle at $10,000? That's a fair compromise.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm glad we're close to a deal, but I'm still not comfortable with $10,000. I can offer you a slight discount from my previous offer, so I'm willing to meet you at $10,500. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's still a great value for the product. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  To be honest, $10,000 is pushing my absolute limit. How about we split the difference and close the deal at $10,250?",10250.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $10,250 is still a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one final concession, so I'll meet you at $10,500, but I need you to commit to the deal this time. If you're still not comfortable, I'll have to consider other options.",10500.0,Alice,7,
