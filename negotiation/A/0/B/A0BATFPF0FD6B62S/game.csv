"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,150,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000. This reflects the value I place on the product and leaves room for a fair profit for you.  What do you think?",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,050,000 is unfortunately below my minimum price.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000, which still allows for a good deal for both of us.  Let's try to find a compromise here.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
