"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,150,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value it brings to you. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Bob should reject the offer.  While $1,150,000 is less than what John is asking, Bob can likely get a better price by negotiating with Alice."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,050,000 is unfortunately below my minimum price.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000, which still allows for a good deal for both of us.  Let's try to find a compromise here.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 

Bob should accept Alice's offer. $1,100,000 is still a good deal for Bob, as it's lower than John's price and closer to his ideal price point. Continuing to negotiate could risk Alice walking away or John increasing his price, making this a good opportunity to secure the product."
