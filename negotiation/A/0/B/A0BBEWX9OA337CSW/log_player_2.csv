"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget. It makes sense to reject the offer and attempt to negotiate a lower price. There's a chance Alice might be willing to negotiate, especially if she values the product less than $1,500,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with my maximum budget of $1,000,000. This sets a clear boundary and gives Alice a strong incentive to negotiate. If she values the product significantly less, this might be a good starting point for a deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still higher than my maximum budget, but she's showing some willingness to negotiate. It's worth trying to get a lower price through another counteroffer. I'll likely aim for something between my initial counteroffer and her offer, potentially $1,100,000 or $1,200,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a compromise between my initial offer of $1,000,000 and Alice's latest offer of $1,300,000. It shows that I'm serious about making a deal but also willing to pay a reasonable amount. It gives Alice a chance to accept a price closer to her target while still allowing me to save some money."
