I'm starting with a price of $1,500,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value, but I believe it's a reasonable starting point to gauge Bob's interest and potentially negotiate upwards.  I'll keep John's offer in mind as a safety net if negotiations with Bob don't go well."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum value. I will reject his offer and proceed to the next round to make a counteroffer. I believe there is still room for negotiation, and I'm not willing to accept a price that undervalues my product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

I'm countering Bob's offer with $1,300,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, but it still represents a decent profit margin for me. I believe this price is fair considering Bob's low initial offer, and I'm hopeful that he will find it acceptable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $1,200,000 meets my minimum value, so I will accept his offer. While I would have preferred to earn more, it's important to secure a sale and avoid potentially further negotiation with Bob.  This is the best outcome considering the alternative of selling to John for the same price."
