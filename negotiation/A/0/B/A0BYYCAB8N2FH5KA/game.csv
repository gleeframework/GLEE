"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that you're looking for a better price, but I'm still confident that $900,000 is a fair price for this product. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $875,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great deal for you.",875000.0,Alice,3,
