"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great opportunity for you to own this valuable item. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900,000. This is a fair price considering its worth to you is $1,000,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While it's a good deal compared to John's price, there's still room for negotiation. Bob can likely get a better price by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm hoping for a price a bit lower to make this deal work for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that you're looking for a better price, but I'm still confident that $900,000 is a fair price for this product. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $875,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great deal for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has lowered her price to $875,000, which is within Bob's budget and a good deal compared to John's price of $1,000,000.  There's a possibility Bob could negotiate further, but the risk of Alice rejecting his counteroffer and losing the deal to John is too high.  Accepting Alice's offer is the safest and most financially advantageous choice at this point."
