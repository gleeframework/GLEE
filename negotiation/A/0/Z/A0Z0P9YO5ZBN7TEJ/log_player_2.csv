Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm glad we're getting closer to a mutually agreeable price. However, I still need to get a bit closer to my target. I'm willing to meet you at $1,075,000, but I'd like to propose a slight adjustment to $1,080,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can seal the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,080,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

This seems like a good point to accept the offer. Alice is signaling this is her final offer and moving only slightly from her previous position.  While we could try to push for a lower price, there's a risk she'll hold firm, and we'd end up with a worse outcome.  Securing the product at $1,080,000 is a good deal compared to John's $1,500,000 price."
