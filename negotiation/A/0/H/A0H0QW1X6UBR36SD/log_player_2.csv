"Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is closer to your desired price point, it's still above your maximum of $800,000.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and negotiate a lower price. You have room to bargain as you're willing to pay $800,000, while Alice is willing to sell for less than $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant step down from Alice's price, but still within the realm of what you are willing to pay.  It's a reasonable starting point for negotiation, leaving room for Alice to counter if she needs to."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $875,000 is within your budget and represents a good compromise. You are willing to pay up to $800,000, and Alice is willing to sell for less than $1,000,000.  While further negotiation is possible, accepting this offer avoids the risk of Alice rejecting your counteroffer and possibly ending the negotiation. It's a good deal for both parties."
