"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within a certain budget. Would you be willing to consider a price closer to $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9,000 is unfortunately a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little, though. How about we settle on $10,500?  This would be a fair price for both of us, and would allow me to make a reasonable profit.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, but $10,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. Would you be willing to consider a price of $10,250? I think this is a fair compromise that would allow us to come to an agreement.",10250.0,Bob,4,
