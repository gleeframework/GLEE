"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000} 
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a high price of $1,500,000.  This is a strong opening offer that allows for room to negotiate while still reflecting the product's value to me. It's important to set the initial bar high, especially since I don't know Bob's perception of the product's worth."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $1,200,000 is a decent offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable value.  I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price range.  I'll reject the offer and try to counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm counteroffering with $1,400,000.  This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer, showing a willingness to negotiate but still aiming for a price closer to my desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While it's higher than his previous offer, it's still below my desired price. I'm willing to keep negotiating with Bob to see if I can get closer to my target.  Selling to John for $1,000,000 is an option, but I'd prefer to try and secure a better price from Bob, if possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000} 
```

**Explanation:**

I'm continuing to lower my price to show flexibility and encourage Bob to come closer to my desired price.  $1,350,000 is a good middle ground between my previous offer and Bob's offer. It shows that I'm willing to compromise, while still maintaining a strong position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

We're nearing the halfway point of the negotiation, and Bob has only offered $1,200,000 twice.  It seems like this might be his ceiling. Accepting the offer would net me a significant amount of money, which is close to my desired target. While I could continue negotiating, there's no guarantee that Bob will increase his offer further. The risk of a counteroffer being rejected and losing time is not worth the potential gain."
