"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a deal. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $12,000. This is a great price, considering the product's value to you is $15,000. I'm confident you'll love it, and I'm willing to make a concession to get us to a deal.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to get a better deal.  Considering the value of this product to me, I'm willing to pay $9,000.  This is a fair price that allows both of us to get a good deal. Let's see if we can make this happen.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your offer of $9,000, but I'm not quite comfortable with that. I'm willing to meet you halfway and make a counteroffer. I'm thinking of selling the product to you for $11,000. This is still a great deal for you, considering the value you place on it, and it's a bit closer to my minimum price. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",11000.0,Alice,3,
