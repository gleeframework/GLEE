"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $150 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying.  I'm willing to pay $110 for the product.  What do you think?",110.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $150 is a bit steep, but I was thinking more along the lines of $140. I'm willing to meet you halfway on the price. What do you think?",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $140 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $115.  If that's not acceptable, I'll have to go with John's offer.",115.0,Bob,4,
