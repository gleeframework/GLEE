{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000.  I think it's a great deal for you, and it's a fair price for me. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is strategic:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:** This gives him room to negotiate but also indicates your seriousness.
* **It's below your minimum:** This allows for potential profit if Bob accepts.
* **It leaves room for counteroffers:**  You can adjust based on his response.

This approach sets up a strong opening position for a negotiation that hopefully leads to a favorable outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I think it's a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $9000 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $9,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum desired value of $15,000.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, but $9,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to stay above $10,000 to make this worthwhile.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,500?  This would give you a good price and allow me to get closer to my desired value."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Explanation:**

This counteroffer:

* **Shows flexibility:**  I've reduced my initial price, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate.
* **Remains above my minimum:**  I'm still above my $15,000 floor.
* **Offers a compromise:** The price is a midpoint between our previous offers, suggesting a genuine attempt to reach an agreement.

This strategy aims to find a balance between securing a reasonable price and continuing the negotiation to potentially improve the outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your concerns, but $10500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $9500 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's counteroffer is still below my minimum desired value of $15,000.  While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm also aware of the opportunity cost involved.  Since John is willing to pay my desired price, it makes more sense to sell to him and avoid further haggling. This ensures I get my minimum value and avoid potential further discounts."
