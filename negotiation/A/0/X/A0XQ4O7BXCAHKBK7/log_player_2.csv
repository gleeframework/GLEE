{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice's offer is far too high.  I'm aiming for a price closer to $800,000, so I'll reject and counteroffer."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for your offer.  While I see the value in this product, $1,200,000 is more than I'm willing to pay right now. I'm prepared to offer $850,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $1,200,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000 either. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  $1,050,000 is still a bit above what I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference - I'll offer $950,000. This is a fair compromise, and it's the most I can do at this time."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob, but I'm not ready to meet you at $950,000 just yet. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for this product. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1,000,000. Let's see if we can find a sweet spot. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, we're getting closer.  I'm still not comfortable with $1,000,000. I'm going to stick with my previous offer of $950,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident it will be a good investment for you as well."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to stick with your previous offer, Bob, but I'm not willing to budge much more. I'm willing to meet you at $980,000, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. This is a significant compromise on my part, and I hope you can see the value in this product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $980,000

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I really appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $980,000 is a good price, but I'm still hoping to come in a bit lower. I'm willing to offer $960,000 as a final compromise.  This is a fair price, and it lets us both walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 960000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $980,000. I've already compromised significantly, and I'm starting to think that we're getting close to the product's true value. I'm willing to meet you at $975,000, but that's as low as I can go. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**  While Alice has come down to $975,000, I'm running out of time and rounds.  Since I can purchase the same product from John for $800,000, it's in my best interest to accept John's offer.  This saves me $175,000 compared to Alice's final offer."
