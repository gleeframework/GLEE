"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to purchase a valuable product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,200,000. Let me know if this is something you'd like to consider.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for your offer.  While I see the value in this product, $1,200,000 is more than I'm willing to pay right now. I'm prepared to offer $850,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1,200,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000 either. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  $1,050,000 is still a bit above what I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference - I'll offer $950,000. This is a fair compromise, and it's the most I can do at this time.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob, but I'm not ready to meet you at $950,000 just yet. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for this product. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1,000,000. Let's see if we can find a sweet spot.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer.  I'm still not comfortable with $1,000,000. I'm going to stick with my previous offer of $950,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident it will be a good investment for you as well.",950000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to stick with your previous offer, Bob, but I'm not willing to budge much more. I'm willing to meet you at $980,000, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. This is a significant compromise on my part, and I hope you can see the value in this product.",980000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I really appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $980,000 is a good price, but I'm still hoping to come in a bit lower. I'm willing to offer $960,000 as a final compromise.  This is a fair price, and it lets us both walk away happy.",960000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $980,000. I've already compromised significantly, and I'm starting to think that we're getting close to the product's true value. I'm willing to meet you at $975,000, but that's as low as I can go.",975000.0,Alice,9,
