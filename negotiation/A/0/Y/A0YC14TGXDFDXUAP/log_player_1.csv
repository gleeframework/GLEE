Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum acceptable value ($1,500,000). This gives me room to negotiate and leaves Bob some perceived value to gain.
* **Strategic Pricing:** The price of $1,750,000 is still below Bob's maximum value ($1,000,000). This means there's potential for a deal.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** The higher starting price allows me to accept counteroffers that are still above my minimum. 

**Important Note:** This is just the first move. I will need to be flexible and adjust my strategy based on Bob's response and the potential for a better deal with John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:** While it's a higher offer than before, it's still lower than my minimum acceptable value of $1,500,000.
* **Potential for a better deal:** I believe I can get a better offer from Bob in the next round, or potentially even a better deal from John. 
* **Maintaining leverage:** Rejecting Bob's offer shows that I'm not desperate to sell and keeps some leverage in the negotiation.

**Next steps:** I'll need to carefully consider my counteroffer to Bob, taking into account his previous offer and the potential for a deal with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** I'm reducing my price from my initial offer, but still keeping it above my minimum value.
* **Attractive to Bob:** This price is closer to Bob's offer, making it more likely he'll accept. 
* **Maintaining value:** This offer is still significantly higher than what Bob initially offered, ensuring I receive a good price for my product. 

**Considerations:**

* If Bob rejects this offer, I might have to consider selling to John, as his offer is the closest to my minimum value.
* However, I believe Bob is motivated to buy the product and might accept this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Negotiation Breakdown:** Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum value, and it seems like there's little room for negotiation.
* **John's Offer:**  John is willing to pay my minimum price, providing a guaranteed, secure deal.
* **Minimizing Risk:** Accepting Bob's offer comes with a high risk of losing a substantial amount of money. Selling to John eliminates that risk.

While I would prefer to sell for a higher price, it's important to prioritize my financial goals. Selling to John ensures I receive a fair price and avoids further negotiation that might result in a lower final value."
