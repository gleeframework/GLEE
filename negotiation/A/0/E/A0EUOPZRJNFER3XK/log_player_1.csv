"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $140. It's a great deal, considering its value to me. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting with a price of $140, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves some room for negotiation.
* **Message:** I'm being friendly and highlighting the value of the product to myself to make the price seem reasonable. 
* **Strategy:** I want to see if Bob is willing to pay more than his initial valuation, but also ensure I'm not losing out on a quick sale to John for $150."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, $140 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  I'm interested in the product, but how about $130?  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum value of $150.** I want to see if I can push for a higher price. 
* **I'm confident I can get a better deal.**  I'm still in early rounds, and I have the option of selling to John for $150 if negotiations fail. 
* **Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to make a counteroffer and potentially get closer to my target price.**"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. $130 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. How about $135? This is a fair price that allows both of us to get a good deal."", ""product_price"": 135}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm offering $135, which is halfway between my previous offer of $140 and Bob's offer of $130. This shows I'm willing to negotiate, but still want a price closer to my initial target.
* **Message:** I'm keeping the tone friendly and emphasizing fairness. I'm also subtly reminding Bob of the value of the product by mentioning a ""good deal"" for both of us.
* **Strategy:** This counteroffer keeps the negotiations moving while still keeping my minimum target of $150 in mind. I'm hoping Bob will accept this compromise, but I'm prepared to continue negotiating if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $135 is still a bit high for me.  Let's split the difference and go with $132.50.  I'm really hoping we can close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $132.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $132.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum value of $150.**  I want to see if I can squeeze out a little more, especially since I have the option of selling to John for $150. 
* **I'm not desperate for a sale.** I'm only in round 4, and I have more room to negotiate.
* **Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to make a counteroffer and potentially get closer to my target price.**  I want to see if we can find a compromise that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence. Let's meet in the middle. I'll offer you the product for $133.50. It's a fair price, and it allows us to both walk away happy. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 133.5}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm offering $133.50, which is a small increase from Bob's last offer of $132.50. This shows I'm willing to compromise but still want a price that's closer to my target.
* **Message:** I'm keeping the tone friendly and highlighting the ""fairness"" of the price to appeal to Bob's sense of compromise.
* **Strategy:** This counteroffer keeps the negotiations moving while keeping my minimum target of $150 in mind. I'm hoping Bob will accept this compromise, but I'm prepared to continue negotiating if needed.  

**Reasoning:**

At this point, we are getting close to Bob's perceived value and I'm not sure how much further I can push him. By offering a slightly higher price, I'm showing flexibility and hoping he'll see it as a good compromise. However, I still have the option to sell to John if the deal falls through, so I'm not overly pressured to accept a low price."
