Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  I appreciate your offer but $2,250,000 is far beyond what I'm willing to pay.  Considering the value I've determined for this product, I'd be happy to offer $1,000,000.  This is a fair starting point for me, and I'm confident we can find a mutually agreeable price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","Bob's offer is very low and significantly undervalues the product.  While I want to negotiate, accepting a price that's less than my minimum isn't an option. I'm willing to counter, but I need to gauge his seriousness.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,850,000 is still out of my budget.  To demonstrate my genuine interest, I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,250,000.  This represents a significant compromise from my previous offer and reflects a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm happy to see we're making progress.  While $1,650,000 is still a bit high, I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000. I believe this price is fair and demonstrates my sincere desire to reach a deal with you.
