"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this unique product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,250,000.  I'm confident this is a fair starting point for us to discuss.",2250000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate your offer but $2,250,000 is far beyond what I'm willing to pay.  Considering the value I've determined for this product, I'd be happy to offer $1,000,000.  This is a fair starting point for me, and I'm confident we can find a mutually agreeable price.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but your offer is significantly below the product's true value.  To find a middle ground, I'm proposing a counteroffer of $1,850,000. I believe this reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your interest.",1850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,850,000 is still out of my budget.  To demonstrate my genuine interest, I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,250,000.  This represents a significant compromise from my previous offer and reflects a fair price for both of us.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you moving closer to a reasonable price. However, we still have a considerable gap to bridge.  I'm willing to come down to $1,650,000. This is a significant reduction on my part, reflecting my desire to close this deal.",1650000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm happy to see we're making progress.  While $1,650,000 is still a bit high, I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000. I believe this price is fair and demonstrates my sincere desire to reach a deal with you.",1400000.0,Bob,6,
