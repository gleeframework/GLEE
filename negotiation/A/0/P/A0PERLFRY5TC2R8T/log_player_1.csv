Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,000,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $850,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. I have 8 rounds left and can still try to negotiate a better price with Bob or sell to John."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $925,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a price we can both be happy with. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 925000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your perspective, but $925,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $875,000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer and shows my commitment to reaching an agreement.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is getting closer to my desired price, $875,000 is still far from my minimum of $1,200,000. I still have 6 rounds to go and can continue to try and negotiate a better price with Bob.  Selling to John for $1,200,000 is always an option if I can't reach a satisfactory deal with Bob."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $875,000 still falls short of what this product is worth.  To demonstrate my flexibility, I'm willing to drop my price to $900,000.  This is a fair offer, considering the value of the product and the concessions I've already made. Let's find a middle ground and close this deal."", ""product_price"": 900000}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $900,000 is still beyond what I can comfortably spend. I'm prepared to offer $890,000. This is a significant move on my part, and I believe it's a fair compromise.  Let's work together to finalize this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $890,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $890,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $890,000 is getting closer to my desired price, it's still significantly below my minimum of $1,200,000.  I have 4 rounds remaining. I'm still hopeful that I can negotiate a better price with Bob, but if I can't reach a satisfactory deal, I'll sell to John for $1,200,000."
