Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $12,000 is still too high for him, and he can potentially get a better deal by counteroffering or buying from John."

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $11,000 is better than $12,000, it's still above his ideal price point. He can try to counteroffer again or go with John's offer."
