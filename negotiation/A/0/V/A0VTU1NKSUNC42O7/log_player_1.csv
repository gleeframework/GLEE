Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$12,000 price:** This is a starting point that is higher than Bob's perceived value of $8,000 but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive and encouraging message:** The message is friendly and encourages Bob to consider the offer.

**Strategy:**

* **Starting high:**  Starting with a higher price allows for more room to negotiate downwards.
* **Leaving room for counteroffers:** This encourages Bob to engage in a negotiation, potentially leading to a price closer to your desired amount. 
* **Having a backup buyer:** The option to sell to John for $15,000 provides a safety net and sets a minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $12,000 is still a bit more than I'm willing to pay. I'm ready to offer you $9,500 for the product.  This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Rejecting Bob's offer:** $9,500 is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000, and even lower than the starting price I offered. 
* **Moving to the next round:** I'm willing to continue negotiations to see if I can reach a more agreeable price. 

**Reasoning:**

* I believe I can still potentially negotiate a better price with Bob. 
* While selling to John for $15,000 is an attractive option, I want to exhaust all negotiation possibilities with Bob first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $9,500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it to be a good value. Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer of $11,000:** This is a compromise from my previous offer of $12,000, showing flexibility and willingness to negotiate.
* **Positive and encouraging message:** I reiterate my confidence in the product's value and my desire to reach a mutually agreeable price. 

**Strategy:**

* **Meeting halfway:** This offer is closer to Bob's offer while still remaining above my minimum acceptable price.
* **Maintaining leverage:** By not immediately accepting Bob's offer, I demonstrate that I'm not desperate to sell and that I believe the product is worth more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $11,000. While it's closer to my budget, I'm still not quite there yet.  I'm willing to offer $10,000 for the product.  This is a final offer, and if it's not acceptable, I'll have to explore other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Sell to John:** While $10,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still significantly lower than what John is offering. I've already made two compromises, and Bob's statement ""This is a final offer"" indicates he's unlikely to budge further.
* **Avoiding further negotiation:**  Negotiating with Bob is unlikely to yield a price closer to my desired amount, and I don't want to risk losing out on the guaranteed $15,000 from John.

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is valuable:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob could drag out the process, potentially leading to delays and a further decrease in price. 
* **Guaranteed profit:** Selling to John provides a guaranteed profit and avoids the risk of Bob's potential rejection of any further counteroffers."
