Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $14,000. I know this is a significant investment, but I truly believe in its value and potential. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:** Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium. Starting high gives room for negotiation if needed.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $14,000 allows me to potentially gain a 40% profit margin over my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Open Communication:** The message is framed positively, emphasizing value and inviting Bob to engage in a conversation. 

**Important Note:**  This is just an initial offer. If Bob rejects it, I can always counter with a lower price, moving closer to my minimum acceptable price of $10,000."
