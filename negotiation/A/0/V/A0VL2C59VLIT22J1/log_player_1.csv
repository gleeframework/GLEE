Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $14,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's $15,000 valuation as possible without scaring him off.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While $14,000 is a strong starting point, there's a slight chance Bob might negotiate down a bit. 
* **Backup Plan:**  We know we have a guaranteed $12,000 from John, so there's no need to go lower than that. 

This strategy balances ambition with a safety net, aiming for a significant profit while acknowledging the possibility of negotiation."
