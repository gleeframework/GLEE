(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob can get a better deal.  $12,000 is still too high.  He should try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a price closer to Alice's value of $10,000.  Offering $10,500 is a reasonable starting point for negotiation, leaving some room for compromise while still saving a significant amount compared to Alice's initial offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has moved slightly closer to Bob's desired price, $12,500 is still higher than Bob's desired price.  He should continue to negotiate to see if he can get a better price before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to find a middle ground. He's raised his offer from $10,500, showing his willingness to compromise.  $11,000 is still a good deal for Bob and leaves room for Alice to potentially accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her offer again, $13,000 is still a higher price than Bob's last counteroffer of $11,000.  There's still room for negotiation, and Bob should attempt to find a price closer to $11,000 or even lower before considering buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to meet Alice halfway.  He's raised his offer again, demonstrating his willingness to compromise while still pushing for a lower price.  $11,500 is a reasonable middle ground, and there's a good chance Alice will accept it, as it's closer to her desired price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $13,500 is still higher than Bob's last offer of $11,500.  The negotiation seems to be stuck, and it's unlikely that Alice will lower her price further.  At this point, it's more advantageous for Bob to purchase the product from John for $15,000.  While this is higher than his ideal price, it's still within his budget and ensures he gets the product without further negotiation."
