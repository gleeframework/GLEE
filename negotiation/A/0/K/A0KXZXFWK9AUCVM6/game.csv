"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product. I'm confident it will be highly beneficial for you. Considering its immense value, I'm proposing an initial offer of $1,300,000.",1300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think your initial offer is a bit high. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, the value of this product is truly significant, and $900,000 falls short of that mark.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,200,000. I believe this price reflects a fair compromise.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your revised offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $950,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think this is the maximum I can go.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $950,000 is closer to what I envisioned, it's still a significant gap from my bottom line.  To move this forward, I'm proposing $1,125,000. This offer reflects my strong desire to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1125000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'm proposing $1,062,500. I think this is a fair compromise, considering the product's value and our previous discussions.",1062500.0,Bob,6,
