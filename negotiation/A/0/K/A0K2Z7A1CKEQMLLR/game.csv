"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $130 might be a bit high for you. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to offer the product to you for $125. What do you think?",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $125 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm happy to pay $120, which would be a fair price for both of us.  Let me know what you think.",120.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $125 is still a bit high for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to offer the product to you for $123. This is as low as I'm willing to go, so I hope you'll consider it.",123.0,Alice,5,
