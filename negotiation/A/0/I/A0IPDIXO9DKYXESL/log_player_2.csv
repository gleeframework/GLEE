"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's something I've valued at no less than $12,000, and I'm confident it would be equally beneficial for your needs. I'm offering it to you for $13,000.  This is a fair price considering the product's worth to both of us. Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $13,000 is higher than your maximum valuation of $12,000 and higher than John's offer. You can get a better price by rejecting this offer and going with John."
