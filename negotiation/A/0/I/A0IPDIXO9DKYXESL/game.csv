"Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's something I've valued at no less than $12,000, and I'm confident it would be equally beneficial for your needs. I'm offering it to you for $13,000.  This is a fair price considering the product's worth to both of us. Let me know if you're interested.",13000.0,Alice,1,
