{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I know it's of significant value to you, and after careful consideration, I'm proposing a price of $925,000. This represents a fair deal considering its potential worth to your business.  What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 925000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's $1,000,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting high allows room for Bob to negotiate down, potentially still landing within a very profitable range.
* **Balance Risk and Reward:** Offering it for $925,000 presents a strong chance Bob will accept, securing a significant profit over the $800,000 backup offer from John. 

This strategy aims for a win-win scenario where Bob gets a product he values for slightly less than his maximum, and Alice secures a fantastic profit."
