Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm, Alice, but I'm not comfortable with the initial price. I'm willing to pay $18,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering its value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $17,500 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $17,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $17,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  We're still in the early-to-middle stages of negotiation. While $17,500 is tempting, holding out a bit longer could yield a better offer from Bob, closer to $18,000 or even slightly higher.  We're not in a rush and losing $2,500 to John's guaranteed offer is significant."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  How about we meet in the middle at $19,000? This feels like a fair deal for both of us."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $17,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the value and my budget.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**  Bob is unlikely to move much higher. Accepting $17,000 now secures a $2,000 profit over John's offer.  Continuing to negotiate carries the risk of Bob lowering his offer further, or the negotiations breaking down entirely."
