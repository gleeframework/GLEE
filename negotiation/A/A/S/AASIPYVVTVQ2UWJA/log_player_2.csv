"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this exceptional product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1200000. Let me know if this is something you'd like to consider. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your maximum budget. It's worth negotiating to try and get a lower price.  Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially save money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying. I'd be willing to purchase it for $900,000. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer starts with a significant reduction from Alice's initial price.  It's a strong starting point for negotiation. We're aiming to be aggressive but still leave room for compromise.  The goal is to find a price that works for both of us."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1200000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $900000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1050000. Let me know if that's more to your liking. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still higher than what I'm willing to pay, but it's getting closer. I'm going to reject this offer and continue negotiating to see if I can get closer to my target price.  There's still room to push for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet halfway, but $1,050,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm happy to go up to $950,000, which is a fair compromise. Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

We're getting closer to the desired price.  This counteroffer is a slight increase from our previous offer but still significantly lower than Alice's last proposal. The goal is to show that we're serious about making a deal, but we're not going to overpay."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that we're getting close to a deal, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for this product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1000000, which is $50000 more than your last offer. Let's see if we can make this work. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's final offer is exactly the same price as John's offer. While I could continue negotiating, it's not guaranteed that I'll get a better price from Alice. There's a risk that she'll reject my next counteroffer and I'll be left with no deal.  By buying from John, I'm guaranteed to get the product at my maximum price point. This decision minimizes risk and ensures I get the product."
