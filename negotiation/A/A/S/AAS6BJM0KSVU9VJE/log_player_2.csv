# Alice's message: I'm offering you a great deal on this product! It's a fantastic opportunity to get it for a steal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

Alice's offer is higher than your maximum price and John is offering the product for less than your limit.  It makes the most sense to buy from John."
