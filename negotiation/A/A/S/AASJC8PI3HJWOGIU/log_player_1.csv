Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a price of $1,200,000 is fair. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $800,000, you can aim significantly higher with Bob. Starting at $1,200,000 leaves room for negotiation while still exceeding your minimum acceptable price. 
* **Scarcity tactic:** Mentioning ""other interested parties"" creates a sense of urgency and competition, potentially motivating Bob to accept your offer or negotiate quickly.
* **Value-based language:** Framing the price around ""value"" and ""potential"" shifts the focus from a pure number to the benefits Bob will receive. 

This strategy aims to maximize your potential profit while still offering Bob a chance to purchase a product he clearly values."
