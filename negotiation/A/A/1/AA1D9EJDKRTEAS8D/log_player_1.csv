{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's significantly lower than your minimum acceptable price:**  This leaves room for negotiation and potential counteroffers from Bob.
* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  This gives Bob incentive to negotiate and potentially accept a price closer to your desired price. 
* **It's a realistic price point:** It's not unreasonable for Bob to consider paying a price closer to $950,000 if he sees the value in the product.

Remember, this is just the first step.  You'll need to be prepared to negotiate and potentially make counteroffers based on Bob's response.  Always keep in mind your minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000 and the option of selling to John as a safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $950,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering its value to me and allows for a healthy profit for you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $850,000 is a decent offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. I'm going to try to negotiate a higher price with Bob."

Bob's offer:
