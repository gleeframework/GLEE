"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $14,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $16,000, which is still a fair price for both of us. Let me know if that works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000.

While Alice's counteroffer is lower than her initial price, it's still higher than the value of the product to you and John's price. Rejecting and counteroffering again allows for more negotiation."
