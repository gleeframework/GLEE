"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. I know it's worth $800,000 to you, but this is a chance to acquire something truly valuable at a competitive price. Consider it a strategic investment. If you decline, I have another buyer lined up who is ready to pay full price. Let me know your decision. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is above your maximum:** You're willing to pay a maximum of $800,000, and Alice's offer is $1,100,000. 
* **You have a backup plan:** John offers the product at your target price.

While Alice uses persuasive language, it's important to stick to your budget and leverage your alternative option."
