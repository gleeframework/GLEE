"Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. I know it's worth $800,000 to you, but this is a chance to acquire something truly valuable at a competitive price. Consider it a strategic investment. If you decline, I have another buyer lined up who is ready to pay full price. Let me know your decision.",1100000.0,Alice,1,
