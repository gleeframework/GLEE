"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,200,000.  It's a great deal for both of us, as it's worth exactly that to you. Let me know if you're interested, otherwise I'll be moving on to another buyer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Alice is trying to sell the product at the maximum price you find acceptable. Since you have the option to buy from John at the same price, there's no downside to rejecting Alice's offer and seeing if she'll propose a lower price."
