(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

It's always worth exploring negotiation before committing to the full price. Since Alice's offer is your maximum, there's no downside to trying to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Starting with a significant discount (20% off) demonstrates your seriousness in negotiating while leaving room for compromise. This counteroffer is aggressive but not unreasonable, potentially encouraging Alice to engage further."

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has moved closer to your desired price, there's still room for further negotiation. It's better to try and squeeze out another price reduction before potentially settling.  There's no risk in rejecting, as you can still purchase from John as a backup."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a compromise, meeting Alice halfway from the previous round. It shows a willingness to negotiate while still trying to get a better price than Alice's current offer. It also keeps the negotiation moving forward without becoming too aggressive."
