"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

This is a high starting price, but it's important to set the bar high.  Since I don't know Bob's valuation, I need to leave room for negotiation while still aiming for a profit well above my minimum.  This will also give me an idea of how much Bob values the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my desired price point, but it's a good sign that he's interested. I will reject his offer and counter with a price that is closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000} 
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to show I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm still holding out for a price that's above my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, and I'm starting to run out of time. Accepting his offer ensures I make a profit above my minimum, and it's a good return considering I don't know how much the product is worth to Bob."
