"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd be interested in. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to let it go for $120.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I can only pay up to $100. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $100 is more than my minimum, it's still significantly lower than what the product is worth to Bob (and therefore, what I could potentially get). I'm going to try to push for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping for something closer to my original asking price.  How about $110?  That's a fair compromise, considering the value of the product to you."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still looking to stay within my budget. Would $95 be within your consideration? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $95 is tempting, it's still below my minimum target price of $80.  I need to keep pushing for a better deal, and I'm not ready to give up on this negotiation just yet. I have 6 rounds left, so there's still room for us to find common ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $95 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but $105 is my absolute bottom line. This is still a good deal for you, given how much the product is worth to you. Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate your flexibility. I would like to propose $100 as the final price for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $100 is above my minimum target price of $80 and it's a good deal considering we're already in round 6 and I have a backup buyer willing to pay $80.  While I'd prefer a higher price, I'm happy with this outcome.  It's important to be flexible in negotiations and know when to accept a reasonable offer."
