Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think it would be a perfect fit for you! I'm offering it to you for $100, which is a great deal considering its value.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** $100 is higher than your minimum price of $80, ensuring you make a profit.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  Bob is willing to pay $120, so there's space for him to counter-offer and for you to find a mutually agreeable price.
* **It's a clear and concise message:**  The message is friendly and straightforward, setting the stage for a positive negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but $100 is a bit above my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $90. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While $90 is a decent price and better than selling to John, I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate your interest, Bob. $90 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to come down a little. How about $95? That's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to what I need."", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to your price, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $95. How about $92? That's my final offer, and I'm willing to walk away if you can't meet me there. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. $92 is a good price, and it's close to my target.  It's also better than selling to John for $80. It seems like Bob is serious about walking away, so I don't want to risk losing this sale."
