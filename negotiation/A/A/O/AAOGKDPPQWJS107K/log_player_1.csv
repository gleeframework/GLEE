Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you first at a special price of $11,500. I believe it offers significant value, even at this price. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we have a guaranteed $12,000 offer from John, trying to get a higher price from Bob first is always advantageous.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $11,500 leaves room for potential negotiation while still being significantly higher than Bob's perceived value. This might entice him while securing a good profit for Alice. 
* **First Refusal Approach:**  By highlighting that Bob has the first opportunity to purchase, we create a sense of urgency and exclusivity, potentially swaying his decision."
