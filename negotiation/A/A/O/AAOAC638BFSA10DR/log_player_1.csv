"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1500000} 

I'm starting high, aiming for a significant profit.  I want to see if Bob is seriously interested and gauge his potential budget.  If he rejects, I'll adjust my offer based on his counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,000,000 is my minimum acceptable price, I'm not willing to settle for it just yet. There are still 8 rounds left, and I believe I can negotiate a higher price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000} 
```

I'm lowering my offer slightly to show some flexibility but still maintaining a significant profit margin. This counteroffer also indicates that I'm serious about a deal with Bob, while still leaving room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,100,000 is a decent price, I still believe I can get closer to my initial target.  With five rounds remaining, I'm going to try to push for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000} 
```

I'm dropping my price to $1,200,000. This compromise shows I'm willing to meet him halfway, but still leaves a reasonable profit for me.  I'm hoping this will convince Bob to accept the offer."
