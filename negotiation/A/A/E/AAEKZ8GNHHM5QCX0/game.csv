"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $6,000 for it.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $6,000 is too low, I'm willing to come down a bit to $13,000. I believe this reflects the true value of the product and what it can do for you.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thanks for coming down a bit. However, $13,000 is still a bit outside my budget. Would you be willing to consider $7,000? I think that's a fair offer.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but I need to be closer to my bottom line. How about $11,000? This is my final offer, as it's already a significant discount.",11000.0,Alice,5,
