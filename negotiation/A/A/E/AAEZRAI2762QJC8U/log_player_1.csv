Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $14,000. I think it would be a valuable addition for you, and this is a very competitive price."", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** You want to get as close to $15,000 as possible, but you also want to make sure Bob is likely to accept.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $12,000, so offering it for that price or lower guarantees he'll accept, but you lose potential profit.
* **Negotiation Room:** Offering it at $14,000 leaves room for Bob to potentially negotiate down a little, while still giving you a significant profit.
* **Alternative Buyer:**  Knowing you have John as a guaranteed buyer at $15,000 gives you leverage. You're not desperate to sell to Bob at any cost.

**This strategy aims to:**

1.  **Secure a deal with Bob:** The price is attractive enough to entice him.
2. **Maximize your profit:** $14,000 is a significant profit margin over your minimum acceptable price. 
3. **Avoid a lengthy negotiation:** While there's room for negotiation, the offer is strong enough that Bob might accept outright."
