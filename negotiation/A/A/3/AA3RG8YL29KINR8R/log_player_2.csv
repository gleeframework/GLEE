You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $1,100,000 is a good price, you can potentially get a better deal by negotiating with Alice.  You still have room to lower the price and save more money."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $1,050,000 is only $50,000 more than what John is offering.  While further negotiation is possible, the risk of Alice rejecting your counteroffer and potentially increasing her price is too high.  Accepting this offer ensures you get the product at a price that's close to your maximum threshold and avoids the potential for a longer, more drawn-out negotiation."
