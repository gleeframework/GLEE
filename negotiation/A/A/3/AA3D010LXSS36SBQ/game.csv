"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value is worth $1,500,000 to you.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. How about we meet in the middle at $850,000?",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $850,000 is a significant discount, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my original offer and your counteroffer. How about we settle at $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit high for my budget.  Could we possibly agree on $950,000? I feel that's a fair compromise.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to go below $1,050,000. I'm willing to give you a slight discount, but I need to make sure I'm not losing too much profit. How about we meet at $1,025,000?",1025000.0,Alice,5,
