Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for your offer, Alice. I'm very interested in the product, but that price is a bit high for me.  Would you consider a price closer to $600,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:
