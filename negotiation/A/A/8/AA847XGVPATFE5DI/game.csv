"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, and I appreciate your interest in the product.  However, $11,000 is simply too low for me to accept. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $12,500? That's a fair price for both of us, and it ensures a smooth transaction.",12500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above my budget. How about we try to get closer to my target of $11,000? I'm willing to meet you at $12,000, and I'm willing to make a commitment to purchase the product today.",12000.0,Bob,4,
