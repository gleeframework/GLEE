"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I recognize the value of the product, that price is too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $700,000 for it."", ""product_price"": 700000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective, but the $700,000 price doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  I'm willing to negotiate, but I need a figure closer to my initial offer. How about we meet halfway at $1,450,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,450,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, we are still quite far apart on price.  I appreciate you meeting me halfway from the initial offer, but to be realistic, I can't go any higher than $750,000."", ""product_price"": 750000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but the gap between our positions is still significant. I'm prepared to come down to $1,300,000, but this is my final offer. I believe it's a fair price that reflects the true value of the product. If this doesn't work, I'll have to explore other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice has made it clear she's unlikely to go much lower than $1,300,000.  This is still significantly higher than your maximum price and the guaranteed offer from John. It's not worth risking further negotiation rounds with Alice."
