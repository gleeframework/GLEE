"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to present this opportunity to you. Given the unique value proposition of this product, I'm offering it at $2,200,000. I believe this price reflects its potential worth and benefits."", 
""product_price"": 2200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  We begin with an ambitious offer significantly higher than both Bob's valuation and our minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and allows us to gauge Bob's interest level. 
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes the ""unique value proposition"" without being too specific. This framing aims to anchor Bob's perception of the product's value at a higher point.

**Strategy:**

Our initial offer is a testing ground. We'll observe Bob's reaction to determine how aggressively we can negotiate in subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I recognize the value of the product, that price is too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $700,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $700,000 is significantly below both our minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000) and his own perceived value ($800,000). This suggests there's room for negotiation. 

**Strategy:**

We will reject this lowball offer and counter with a price closer to, but still above, our minimum.  We need to signal that we're willing to negotiate while maintaining a firm stance on the product's value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective, but the $700,000 price doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  I'm willing to negotiate, but I need a figure closer to my initial offer. How about we meet halfway at $1,450,000?"",
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway (Not Really):**  While we frame it as meeting halfway, $1,450,000 is strategically closer to our initial offer than Bob's. This keeps the price high while demonstrating a willingness to negotiate.
* **Highlighting Value:** We reiterate that the product's value is higher than Bob's offer. This reinforces the idea that we're making a concession. 

**Strategy:**

We're aiming for a rapid negotiation. We've made a significant jump from our initial offer to entice Bob while remaining above our minimum acceptable price. We'll observe his reaction in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we are still quite far apart on price.  I appreciate you meeting me halfway from the initial offer, but to be realistic, I can't go any higher than $750,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's counteroffer of $750,000 shows minimal movement and remains far below both his perceived value and our minimum. This suggests he might be trying to anchor the negotiation at a very low price.

**Strategy:**

It's time to change tactics.  We will make a smaller concession in the next round, but we'll also clearly signal that our willingness to negotiate has its limits. The goal is to incentivize Bob to make a more substantial jump while keeping the option of selling to John open."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but the gap between our positions is still significant. I'm prepared to come down to $1,300,000, but this is my final offer. I believe it's a fair price that reflects the true value of the product. If this doesn't work, I'll have to explore other options."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Smaller Concession:**  We've reduced our price by $150,000, a smaller jump than before, signaling that we're reaching our limit. 
* **Final Offer:**  By stating this is our ""final offer,"" we create urgency and put the ball firmly in Bob's court. 
* **Alternative Option:**  Mentioning ""other options"" subtly reminds Bob that we have the fallback of selling to John.

**Strategy:**

This offer is designed to elicit Bob's true willingness to pay.  If he doesn't significantly increase his offer, we'll likely walk away and pursue the guaranteed $1,500,000 from John."
