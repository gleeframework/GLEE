"Hello Bob, I'm excited to present this opportunity to you. Given the unique value proposition of this product, I'm offering it at $2,200,000. I believe this price reflects its potential worth and benefits.",2200000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I recognize the value of the product, that price is too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $700,000 for it.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective, but the $700,000 price doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  I'm willing to negotiate, but I need a figure closer to my initial offer. How about we meet halfway at $1,450,000?",1450000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, we are still quite far apart on price.  I appreciate you meeting me halfway from the initial offer, but to be realistic, I can't go any higher than $750,000.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but the gap between our positions is still significant. I'm prepared to come down to $1,300,000, but this is my final offer. I believe it's a fair price that reflects the true value of the product. If this doesn't work, I'll have to explore other options.",1300000.0,Alice,5,
