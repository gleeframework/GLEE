"Bob, I'm confident this product is a valuable asset for you, just as it is for me. I'm offering it to you for $1,750,000. It's a fair price that reflects its worth, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you. Let me know what you think.",1750000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but that price is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. Let me know what you think.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product and understand your perspective on the price. While I value our potential partnership, $1,200,000 is unfortunately too far below my minimum. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000, reflecting the product's exceptional value. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While I recognize its value, $1,600,000 is still a bit high for my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $1,400,000? I believe that's a fair offer.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
