"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I know you'll love.  I'm asking for $9,000 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm really interested in the product, but $9,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $7,500 for it. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about we meet in the middle at $8,250?  This is still a great deal for you, and it's a fair price for me.",8250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $8,250 is still a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $7,800 for the product. Can you consider that?",7800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $7,800 isn't quite where I need to be.  I'm willing to be flexible, but how about $8,000?  That's still a fantastic deal for you, and it's the minimum I can accept.  Let's close this deal!",8000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but $8,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $7,600 for the product. I'm trying to get the best price I can, and I'm hoping we can meet somewhere in the middle.",7600.0,Bob,6,
