Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but $9,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $7,500 for it. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'll reject Bob's offer for now. While $7,500 is better than nothing, I can likely get closer to my desired price with some negotiation.  I want to see if I can get Bob to come up a bit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about we meet in the middle at $8,250?  This is still a great deal for you, and it's a fair price for me."", ""product_price"": 8250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $8,250 is still a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $7,800 for the product. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $7,800 is close, I'm still aiming for a bit more.  I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can get him to go just a little higher.  I'm confident I can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $7,800 isn't quite where I need to be.  I'm willing to be flexible, but how about $8,000?  That's still a fantastic deal for you, and it's the minimum I can accept.  Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 8000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $8,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $7,600 for the product. I'm trying to get the best price I can, and I'm hoping we can meet somewhere in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,600
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While I'm disappointed Bob hasn't come up to my minimum price, I don't want to risk him lowering his offer further.  I'm content with selling to John for $8,000. It's a guaranteed sale at my minimum threshold and I don't want to risk getting less."
