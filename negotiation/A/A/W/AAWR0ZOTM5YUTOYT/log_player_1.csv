Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}

I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value of $12,000, but it gives me room to negotiate down if needed. It also signals that I believe the product is valuable and I'm not desperate to sell."

I'm going to accept Bob's offer of $13,000.  While it's not my ideal price, it's a good compromise and a significant improvement over his previous offers.  It's also worth noting that we're nearing the halfway point in our negotiations, and I don't want to risk losing this deal by being too stubborn."
