# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to get your hands on something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's worth to you is $15,000. What do you think?

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your target price is $10,000, but I'm still looking to get a better deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $11,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you is $15,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $11,000 is a good deal compared to John's offer, Bob is still aiming to save as much as possible. There's still room for negotiation to get closer to his target of $10,000. By rejecting Alice's offer, Bob can continue trying to secure a lower price."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $11,000 is tempting, I'm still hoping to get closer to my target of $10,000. How about we meet in the middle at $10,500?  Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to find a mutually beneficial agreement. However, I'm still not willing to go above $11,000. I'm willing to give you a slight concession and offer the product to you for $10,750. This is my final offer, and I hope you can accept it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $10,750 is very close to Bob's target of $10,000.  While Bob could potentially continue negotiating, it's likely Alice is firm on her offer. Accepting this offer saves Bob $4,250 compared to buying from John, which is a significant saving."
