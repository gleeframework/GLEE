"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

You can get the product for a lower price from Alice than from John.  Rejecting Alice's offer allows you to try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer starts the negotiation by offering a price significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still above her minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. This gives Alice room to negotiate while still leaving you with a substantial savings compared to buying from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's new offer is lower than her initial offer, it's still higher than what you're hoping to pay. There's still room for negotiation to get a better price.  Rejecting her offer keeps you in the negotiation and allows you to make another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a compromise between your previous offer of $1,300,000 and Alice's current offer of $1,400,000. It shows that you're willing to negotiate, but are still aiming for a price lower than what Alice wants. This keeps the negotiation moving while increasing the chances of reaching a mutually agreeable price."
