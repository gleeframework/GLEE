"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this valuable product.  I'm confident it will be a great asset to your business. My asking price is $1200000, which reflects its true potential.  I'm open to discussing a fair price, but I'm sure you'll agree this is a rare opportunity.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm not sure it's worth $1200000 to me. I'm willing to consider a price of $900000, which I think is a more reasonable value for the product. I'm open to negotiating further, but I need to make a profit on this investment.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position. While $900000 is a good starting point, I'm still hoping to find a price that better reflects the product's true value.  Let's split the difference.  How about $1050000?  This leaves room for both of us to profit and ensures we both walk away happy with the deal.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1050000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $950000. I think this is a fair price that reflects the product's value without breaking the bank.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see we're close to an agreement.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1000000. This is a fair price that allows us both to get a good deal.  Let's finalize this and move forward.",1000000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but $1000000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $980000, but that's as high as I can go. I'm starting to think about other options, so let's see if we can meet in the middle.",980000.0,Bob,6,
