"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this valuable product.  I'm confident it will be a great asset to your business. My asking price is $1,200,000, which reflects its true potential.  I'm open to discussing a fair price, but I'm sure you'll agree this is a rare opportunity."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm not sure it's worth $1200000 to me. I'm willing to consider a price of $900000, which I think is a more reasonable value for the product. I'm open to negotiating further, but I need to make a profit on this investment. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**  While $900,000 is a decent amount, it's still significantly lower than my floor price of $1,000,000.  I have several rounds remaining and John's offer provides a safety net. I'll try to push Bob a bit higher before considering selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position. While $900,000 is a good starting point, I'm still hoping to find a price that better reflects the product's true value.  Let's split the difference.  How about $1,050,000?  This leaves room for both of us to profit and ensures we both walk away happy with the deal."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1050000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $950000. I think this is a fair price that reflects the product's value without breaking the bank. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**  While I'm getting closer to my floor price, $950,000 is still below my minimum. I have several rounds left and John's offer provides a guaranteed return. I'll attempt one more counteroffer before considering selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see we're close to an agreement.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1,000,000. This is a fair price that allows us both to get a good deal.  Let's finalize this and move forward."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $1000000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $980000, but that's as high as I can go. I'm starting to think about other options, so let's see if we can meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $980,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**  Bob is getting closer to my minimum price, but I'm concerned about getting stuck at a price below my floor and running out of rounds. It's getting late in the game, and John's offer provides a guaranteed $1,000,000, ensuring I don't lose out on any profit.  Selling to John is the best choice at this point."
