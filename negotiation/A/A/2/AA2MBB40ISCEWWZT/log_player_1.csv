{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,150,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:**  I'm starting with a price slightly above my minimum value. This is a good starting point to see if Bob is willing to negotiate.
* **Leaving Room:**  A price of $1,150,000 leaves room for negotiation, allowing for both of us to potentially find a mutually agreeable price. 
* **John as a Safety Net:** I have John as a backup buyer, giving me confidence to push for a better price with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. Can we meet in the middle at $1,075,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:** Bob's offer is still below my desired minimum of $1,000,000, so it's not acceptable.
* **Negotiation:**  I'm choosing to reject his offer and continue negotiating.  I believe there's still room to get a better price closer to my target. 
* **Counteroffer:** I'll make a counteroffer to Bob in the next round, aiming for a price closer to $1,100,000 or higher. 
* **Safety Net:**  While John offers a guaranteed $1,000,000, I'm not willing to settle just yet, as I see potential to earn more from Bob."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still aiming for a price closer to $1,100,000.  Let's split the difference and settle on $1,087,500.  This would be a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1087500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Middle Ground:** My counteroffer is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway between his offer of $1,075,000 and my previous offer of $1,150,000.
* **Still Above Minimum:** This counteroffer is still above my minimum desired price of $1,000,000, so it's a good starting point for the next round.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using positive language to emphasize a fair deal for both of us, which can help maintain a good relationship during the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I still think $1,087,500 is a bit steep. I'm willing to go up to $1,075,000, but I'd really like to get it for $1,050,000. Can we meet somewhere in between at $1,062,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,062,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,062,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** Bob's offer of $1,062,500 is still below my minimum desired price of $1,000,000.  While it's closer than his previous offers, it's not enough for me to accept.
* **Potential for Better Deal:** I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob, as I believe there's a good chance I can get a price closer to my target with further negotiation. 
* **John as Safety Net:**  Although John offers a guaranteed $1,000,000, I'm still confident that I can achieve a higher price with Bob. 
* **Counteroffer:** I'll make a counteroffer to Bob in the next round, aiming for a price closer to $1,075,000 or higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but I'm still not quite there yet. I'm willing to come down to $1,070,000. This is a fair compromise, and it's still a great deal for you considering the product's value.  Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 1070000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Target:** My counteroffer is just below my desired minimum price, but it's significantly higher than Bob's last offer. 
* **Compromise:** I'm showing flexibility by meeting him halfway between my previous offer and his latest offer.
* **Emphasize Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to him, which could encourage him to accept.
* **Positive Language:** I'm using positive and encouraging language (""great deal,"" ""make this happen"") to keep the negotiation positive.

I'm hoping this counteroffer will be enough to reach an agreement with Bob. However, if he rejects it, I'll need to assess whether to continue negotiating or to accept John's offer as a safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to go up to $1,065,000, but I'd really like to get it for $1,050,000. Can we meet somewhere in between at $1,057,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,057,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,057,500

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum price, it's still not quite there. 
* **Negotiation Fatigue:**  We've been going back and forth for a few rounds, and it seems like the gap between our desired prices is stubborn. 
* **Risk of Stalemate:** Continued negotiation could lead to a stalemate, and I risk losing time and potentially losing Bob as a buyer altogether.
* **John's Guaranteed Offer:** John offers a guaranteed $1,000,000, which is my minimum acceptable price. This ensures I get a good return, even if it's not the ideal outcome. 

Given the circumstances, it's best to accept John's offer and sell the product to him. It's a safe and secure choice that guarantees my desired minimum profit."
