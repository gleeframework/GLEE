Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $14,000. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this is a fair price that reflects its worth."", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** My goal is to get as close to Bob's $15,000 valuation as possible. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering $14,000 leaves some space for potential counter-offers from Bob, while still securing a significant profit above my minimum.
* **Time Value & Alternative Buyer:** While I have a guaranteed sale at $12,000, selling to Bob quickly at $14,000 is more profitable even if it takes slightly longer than the guaranteed sale."
