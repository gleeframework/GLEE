# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I think you'll find it's worth every penny. I'm willing to sell it to you for $11,500. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While the offer of $11,500 is slightly above Alice's valuation, it's still significantly less than your maximum price of $12,000. Accepting this offer saves you $500 compared to buying from John."
