"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a great deal for both of us! Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice's offer is closer to your maximum price than her minimum. There's room for negotiation to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but that's a bit high for me. How about $10,500?"",
""product_price"": 10500
}
```

**Reasoning:** This counteroffer aims to bring the price closer to Alice's minimum while still leaving room for further negotiation if needed. It's a significant jump down from Alice's offer, but it demonstrates a strong desire to purchase while making it clear you're looking for a more competitive price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,500 is a little low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $11,000? That leaves some room for both of us to be happy. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice is moving towards a more reasonable price, but it's still above the midpoint between your initial offer and her starting price.  There's a good chance you can negotiate further and get closer to $10,500 or even lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand, Alice. I'm willing to meet you halfway on our previous offers.  Would you consider $10,750?"",
""product_price"": 10750
}
```

**Reasoning:**  By suggesting the midpoint between the previous two offers ($10,500 and $11,000), we're demonstrating a willingness to compromise while still pushing for a price closer to our target. This approach keeps the negotiation moving forward and avoids a stalemate."
