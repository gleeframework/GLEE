Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a great deal for both of us! Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're ensuring you make at least $1,500 profit.
* **It's below Bob's value:**  There's room for negotiation and potential for Bob to accept.
* **It shows you're willing to negotiate:** The message makes it clear you're open to finding a price that works for both of you.

If Bob rejects this offer, you'll have to assess his counteroffer and decide if it's worth continuing negotiations or selling to John for $10,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but that's a bit high for me. How about $10,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still below your desired profit margin. You can still potentially negotiate a higher price. By rejecting his offer, you'll be able to make a counteroffer and see if you can reach a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,500 is a little low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $11,000? That leaves some room for both of us to be happy."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand, Alice. I'm willing to meet you halfway on our previous offers.  Would you consider $10,750? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $10,750 is very close to your minimum acceptable price of $10,000.  While you'd ideally like to get closer to your initial asking price, continuing to negotiate risks losing the sale entirely.  Accepting this offer ensures you make a profit and avoid the risk of ending up with the lower price from John."
