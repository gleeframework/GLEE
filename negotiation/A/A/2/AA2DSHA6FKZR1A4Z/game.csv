"Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your position, but $8,000 is quite a bit lower than what I'm looking for.  How about we meet in the middle somewhere around $11,000?",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. While $11,000 is closer, it's still a bit above my budget.  Would you be willing to consider $9,500?",9500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, you're definitely getting closer! I'm willing to come down a bit more, how about $10,500?",10500.0,Alice,5,
