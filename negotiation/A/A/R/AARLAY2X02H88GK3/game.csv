"Hello Bob, I believe this product presents a unique opportunity and would be highly valuable to your business. I'm initially offering it to you at $1,300,000.  I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial arrangement.",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I agree the product has potential, the price point is currently too high for me. I'm willing to offer $600,000 for the product.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $600,000 is significantly below its true value. Let's find a middle ground.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand the product has value, but $1,100,000 is still beyond my budget. I'm willing to increase my offer to $700,000.  I believe this is a fair compromise, considering the market value and my specific needs.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm sensing your commitment to this deal, and I want to find a solution that works for both of us.  However, the product's value is firmly above $1,000,000.  My final offer is $950,000. This is a significant reduction on my part, reflecting my willingness to negotiate.",950000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $950,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I need to be realistic about my budget. To be completely transparent, I've secured another offer for a similar product at a lower price.  I'm prepared to offer you $800,000 as my final offer. If we can agree on this, I'm ready to close the deal today.",800000.0,Bob,6,
