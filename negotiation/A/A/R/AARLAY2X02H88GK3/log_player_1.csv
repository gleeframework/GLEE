Round 6
Bob's offer:

To be completely transparent, I've secured another offer for a similar product at a lower price.  I'm prepared to offer you $800,000 as my final offer. If we can agree on this, I'm ready to close the deal today.

This is a tough one, but here's why it's time to accept:

* **Bob is at his maximum:** Bob has revealed the product's worth to him ($800,000) and made it clear this is his final offer. 
* **Diminishing returns:**  Continuing to negotiate might only yield small increases from Bob, while the risk of losing him grows. 
* **Time value of money:** Closing the deal now provides immediate capital that can be reinvested. 

While selling to John nets $200,000 more, the certainty of securing $800,000 now outweighs the potential but uncertain gain."
