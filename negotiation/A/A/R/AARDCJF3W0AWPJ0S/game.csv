"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,200,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its worth to me.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to bridge the gap and offer the product at $1,300,000. This price is still very attractive given the product's value, and it allows us to both achieve a good outcome. Let's find common ground and finalize this deal.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you at $1,250,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. Can we meet in the middle?",1250000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,250,000 doesn't reflect the true value of this product for your business.  I'm willing to make one final concession and offer it to you at $1,275,000.  This price is a fair compromise, allowing us both to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.  Let's finalize this deal now.",1275000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to go up to $1,200,000, but no higher. I think this is the maximum I can afford, and I'm willing to walk away if we can't agree on a price. Can you meet me at this price?",1200000.0,Bob,6,
