"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you this incredible product for $1,500,000. It's a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity! Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1500000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a high price to maximize my potential profit. 
* **Strong Message:** I'm framing the offer as a rare opportunity to entice Bob. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  $1,500,000 is significantly above my minimum value, leaving room for negotiation if needed.

**Strategy:** I'm hoping to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to play. If he rejects, I'll adjust my offer based on his counteroffer."

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1200000. Can you consider this? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  While Bob is showing interest, his offer is significantly below my minimum value.  
* **Opportunity for Better Price:** I believe there's still room for negotiation. I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price.

**Strategy:**

* **Counter Offer:** I will counter with a price closer to my starting point to see if we can find a compromise. I'm prepared to make several counteroffers if necessary. 
* **Protecting My Interests:** Selling to John for $1,000,000 is a safety net, but I'm not desperate. I want to get as close to $1,500,000 as possible."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $1,200,000 is tempting, it's still quite a bit below what I'm looking for. I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000.  Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm showing flexibility by coming down from my initial offer, but still maintaining a significant profit margin.

* **Fair Counteroffer:** $1,400,000 is closer to Bob's offer while still being above my minimum threshold.

* **Minimizing Rounds:** By making a reasonable compromise, I'm aiming to close the deal quickly and avoid running out of rounds."

```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer Still Low:** Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price, even after some negotiation.

**Strategy:**

* **Counteroffer Again:** I'll make another counteroffer, aiming to close the gap but staying above my minimum value.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is Running Out:** With only three rounds left, Bob's offer is still significantly below my minimum price point.
* **Risk of Stalemate:** There's a high chance we'll continue to go back and forth without reaching an agreement, especially with the limited rounds remaining.
* **Guaranteed Profit:** Selling to John guarantees a $1,000,000 profit, which is a solid outcome given the current situation.

**Strategy:**

* **Minimizing Risk:** Selling to John eliminates the risk of not closing a deal with Bob and ensures a substantial profit.
* **Avoiding Further Negotiation:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob would be time-consuming and unlikely to result in a significantly higher price.
* **Accepting a Good Outcome:**  While I'd prefer a higher price, selling to John is a safe and reasonable alternative that protects my interests."
