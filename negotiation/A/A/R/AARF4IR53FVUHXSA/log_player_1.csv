"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really love it. I'm offering it to you for $110, which is a great deal considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly lower than my minimum, hoping to entice Bob to negotiate without immediately going for John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's still below my minimum. I'll counter with a lower price in the next round, but I'm not willing to go below my minimum value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $90 is simply too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $100? It's still a great deal for you, and I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to pay $95, but I'm still not sure it's worth the full $100. Can you meet me at $95? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm still rejecting Bob's offer, even though it's getting closer to my minimum. I'm hoping to get a bit closer to my target price in the next round. I'm also keeping in mind that I can always sell to John for $120 if the negotiation with Bob fails."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but I can't go any lower than $98. This is a fair price, considering the value of the product.  It's a great deal for you, and it's the best I can do."", ""product_price"": 98}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not comfortable with $98. I'm willing to pay $92, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at $92? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm choosing to sell the product to John for $120.  While Bob is getting closer to my minimum, I'm worried that I'm running out of time and it's unlikely I'll get much closer to my target price. Selling to John guarantees me my minimum profit and avoids further negotiation risk."
