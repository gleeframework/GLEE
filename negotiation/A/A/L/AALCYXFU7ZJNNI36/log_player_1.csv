{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really enjoy it!  I'm asking for $110 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum acceptable price ($100) to leave room for negotiation.  I've also made a friendly opening to encourage Bob to consider my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for offering! That's a bit steep for me though. Would you consider $65? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $65. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $65
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low.  I'm going to reject it and try to get closer to my minimum acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob,  I appreciate your interest!  $65 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and I offer it to you for $85?  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 85}
```

I'm splitting the difference between my desired price ($100) and Bob's offer ($65) to try and reach a compromise. I'm also keeping the message friendly to maintain a positive negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $85 is still a bit more than I'm hoping to spend. How about $75? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $75 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not happy with that price.  I'm going to counteroffer again, but I'm also aware that John is a secure alternative if this doesn't work out."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to find a price that works for you. While I appreciate your offer, $75 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $80?  This would be a fair price for both of us.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 80}
```

I'm sticking with my strategy of splitting the difference, hoping Bob will agree to this compromise. I'm also emphasizing that this price is fair for both of us, which can be persuasive."
