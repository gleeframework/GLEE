"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to acquire a high-value product. I believe it's a game-changer in its industry, and I'm confident you'll see its potential. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900000. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I'm not quite ready to commit to $900000. I'm willing to pay $750000 for the product. I believe it's a great opportunity, but I need to make sure it's a good deal for me. Can you consider my offer?",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $750000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. Considering the product's value and potential, I'm thinking of a price that's closer to the original offer. How about we meet in the middle at $825000? It's a fair price that reflects the product's worth, and I believe you'll find it a great deal.",825000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $750000 and $825000, which would be $787500. Can you consider this offer?",787500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. However, $787500 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. Considering the product's value and the market demand, I'm willing to go a bit higher. How about we try $825000 again, or even $850000 if you're willing to meet me at that price?",850000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand your concerns, Alice, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $787500 and $850000, which would be $818750. Can you consider this offer?",818750.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, Bob. However, I'm still not convinced that $818750 fully captures the product's value. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target. How about we try $835000? It's a fair price that reflects the product's worth, and I believe you'll find it a great deal.",835000.0,Alice,7,

"I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're getting close to the end of our negotiations, Bob. I'm willing to make one final concession, but I need to get closer to my target. I'm thinking of a price that's a bit higher than $811250. How about we try $825000 again? It's a fair price that reflects the product's worth, and I believe you'll find it a great deal.
