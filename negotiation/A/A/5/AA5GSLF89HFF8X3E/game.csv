"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer! I understand that $12,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm still willing to work with you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $11,500. This is a great compromise, considering the product's value to you is $15,000. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $11,500 is closer, but still a bit more than I was hoping to spend.  How about $10,500?",10500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $11,500 was still a bit out of your budget, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to offer the product to you for $11,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to you is $15,000. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,5,
