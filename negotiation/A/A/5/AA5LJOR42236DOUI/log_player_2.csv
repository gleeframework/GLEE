"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to start with a price of $18,000. This is a competitive price considering its worth to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a great investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
 
Alice's starting offer is way above your budget and even above her own valuation. You should definitely counter with a much lower offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's way outside my budget. I'm looking to spend closer to $5,000 for the product.  Let me know if that's something you can work with."", ""product_price"": 5000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  Negotiation often benefits from anchoring.  By starting significantly lower than both Alice's offer and your true budget, you create room for bargaining and gauge Alice's flexibility.
* **Polite but Firm:**  The message maintains a respectful tone while clearly stating your price limit.
* **Leaving Room for Alice:**  The phrase ""something you can work with"" implies you're open to negotiation but not desperate."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $5,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer it to you for $10,000. This is a fair price considering the value it brings to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a great deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While Alice came down significantly, $10,000 is still above both your budget and John's offer.  There's room for further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice. However, $10,000 is still a bit high for me.  Would you consider $6,500? I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 6500}

**Reasoning:**

* **Upward Movement:** You're showing willingness to compromise by increasing your offer considerably.
* **Staying Below John:** It's crucial to remain below $8,000 to maintain leverage. You have the backup option of buying from John if needed.
* **Targeting the Middle Ground:** This offer aims for a price point closer to the middle of your initial offer and Alice's current offer, encouraging her to meet you halfway."
