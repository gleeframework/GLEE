"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think that's the maximum I can go.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,200,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to compromise, but $1,350,000 is my final offer. It's still a great deal for you, given the product's value.  Let's close this deal.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our offers, so I'll counter with $1,325,000. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial price.",1325000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $1,325,000 is still a bit low. I'm willing to meet you halfway again. My final counteroffer is $1,340,000. Let's make this happen.",1340000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand you're trying to meet me in the middle, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,340,000. I'll try to find a compromise again. My next offer is $1,320,000. Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",1320000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,320,000 is still below my minimum price. I'm offering one last compromise at $1,330,000. This is a fair deal considering the product's value to you. Let's seal the deal.",1330000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to make one last compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,330,000. I'm willing to go up to $1,325,000, but that's as high as I can go. Let's see if we can meet in the middle one more time.",1325000.0,Bob,8,
