"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $250 is quite a bit more than I'm willing to spend. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $80 right now.  Let me know what you think.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $80 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of a price around $180. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll find it worth the investment. What do you think?",180.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $180 is still too high for me. I'm happy to pay $100 for the product. It's a fair price that gives us both a good deal. Let's make this happen.",100.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $100 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price around $140. It's still a good deal for both of us, and I think you'll find it worth the investment. What do you think?",140.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $140 is still more than I'm comfortable spending.  I'm willing to go up to $120, which is a fair price for both of us.  Let's close this deal.",120.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $120 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm thinking of a price around $130. It's still a good deal for both of us, and I think you'll find it worth the investment. What do you think?",130.0,Alice,7,
