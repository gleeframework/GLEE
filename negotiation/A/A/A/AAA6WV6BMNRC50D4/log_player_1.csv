"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
```

I'm starting high, aiming for a price that's above my minimum but still potentially appealing to Bob. This gives me room to negotiate down if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $12,000 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my target in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 16000}
```

I'm dropping my price slightly, but still aiming for a profit. This shows Bob that I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm also not desperate to sell below my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $13,500 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still not satisfied. I believe I can get a better deal with more negotiation. I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can reach a mutually acceptable price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14500}
```

I'm going to try and meet Bob halfway this time. He's clearly not willing to pay much more than $13,500, so I'm offering a price that's closer to his offer but still above my minimum. If this fails, I'll have to seriously consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

We've reached a point where Bob's offers are very close to my minimum, but I'm not sure I can get him to budge any further.  Selling to John ensures I get my desired price and avoids any further risk of a deal falling through."
