"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value you see in this product, $15,000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go. I'm prepared to pay $10,000 for it.  Let me know if that works for you.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $10,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $13,500. This is a fair price considering the value you place on the product and the value I place on it.",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $13,500 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go to $11,000. This is a fair compromise, considering we're both getting closer to our ideal price. Let's see if we can seal the deal.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to my minimum price, but I'm still not comfortable selling for $11,000. I'm willing to meet you at $12,500, which is the lowest I can go. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",12500.0,Alice,5,
