"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which I believe would greatly benefit you. Given its value and quality, I propose a price of $140 for it. I hope this aligns with your expectations and budget. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer of $140 is too high. There's room to negotiate down towards your $120 limit, especially since you have John as a backup option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $140 is a bit out of my price range. Would you consider $100?"",
""product_price"": 100
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  While $100 is quite a bit lower than Alice's offer, it establishes a strong starting point for negotiation. 
* **Leaving Room to Negotiate:**  This counteroffer gives you space to meet Alice somewhere in the middle, ideally closer to your $120 limit. 
* **Polite and Direct:** The message is respectful of Alice's time while clearly stating your budget constraints."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your interest, Bob. I understand your budget constraints. However, I must respectfully decline your offer of $100. I am unable to reduce the price below $120 due to the value and cost associated with the product. I appreciate your understanding. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has met your maximum price. There's no benefit to negotiating further, as you can't get a better deal with John.  Accepting now secures the product at the best possible price."
