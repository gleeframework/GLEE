"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1750000} 

I'm starting with a high offer, knowing Bob values the product at $1,000,000. This sets the stage for negotiation and allows for potential concessions later."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is higher than his initial valuation, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I'll reject this offer and continue negotiating to see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000} 
```

I'm lowering my price slightly from the initial offer, but I'm still aiming for a price that's closer to my minimum acceptable price. This shows flexibility while also demonstrating my commitment to reaching a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Although Bob is getting closer to my desired price, $1,150,000 is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I'm not yet ready to sell for that amount, so I'll reject this offer and continue negotiating.  I still have time to potentially reach a better deal with Bob or sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000} 
```

I'm making a significant concession by dropping my price to $1,400,000. This reflects my willingness to compromise, but it's also a price that's still within my acceptable range.  I'm hoping this will encourage Bob to make a final push to reach a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer of $1,050,000 is far below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  With only 4 rounds left, I'm unlikely to get a better offer from Bob, and I don't want to risk getting stuck with a lower price.  Selling to John for $1,500,000 guarantees me my desired profit and ensures a quick sale."
