"Alice, I understand your point about the product's value, but $1,025,000 is still above my budget.  Let's find a price that works for both of us.  I'm willing to go up to $950,000 for the product. This is a significant increase from my previous offer, showing my commitment to closing this deal.",950000.0,Bob,4,
