"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $12,000 to you. Let me know what you think!",11000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I really like the product, but I'm on a tight budget. Can we meet in the middle at $10,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're on a tight budget, but $9,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but how about we meet at $10,500? It's still a great deal for you, as the product is worth $12,000 to you. Let's find a compromise that works for both of us.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $10,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,000 and $10,500, so how about we try $9,750? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can come to an agreement.",9750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9,750 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers, so how about $10,125?  I think this is a fair price considering the value of the product for you. Let's finalize this deal!",10125.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit hesitant at $10,125. How about we try $9,900? It's a small concession from my previous offer, but I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product for me.",9900.0,Bob,6,
