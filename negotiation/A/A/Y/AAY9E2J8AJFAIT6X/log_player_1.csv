"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I really like the product, but I'm on a tight budget. Can we meet in the middle at $10,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
I'll reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price.  $9,000 is still too low for me, but I'm willing to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're on a tight budget, but $9,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but how about we meet at $10,500? It's still a great deal for you, as the product is worth $12,000 to you. Let's find a compromise that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $10,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,000 and $10,500, so how about we try $9,750? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While $9,750 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not satisfied. I'm going to try one more counteroffer to see if we can reach an agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9,750 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers, so how about $10,125?  I think this is a fair price considering the value of the product for you. Let's finalize this deal!"", ""product_price"": 10125}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're trying to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit hesitant at $10,125. How about we try $9,900? It's a small concession from my previous offer, but I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,900
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'll accept Bob's offer of $9,900. It's a bit lower than I hoped for, but it's still above my minimum and a good deal considering the value to Bob.  I don't want to risk losing the sale completely by rejecting his offer and going through more rounds of negotiation."
