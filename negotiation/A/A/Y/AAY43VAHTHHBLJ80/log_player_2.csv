"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a unique opportunity to get your hands on something truly valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $11,500. I think this is a fair price considering the product's worth to you is $12,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

Alice's offer is a good starting point, but there's room for negotiation. I should make a counteroffer aiming for a price closer to $10,000."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $11,000. This is a compromise that I think still benefits both of us. What do you think?

Alice is negotiating, which is good. I'll counteroffer again, pushing for a price closer to $10,500. It's a balance between aiming for a good deal and the risk of her accepting John's offer."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $10,500 is still a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I can offer it to you for $11,250. This is my final compromise, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250

Alice is clearly sticking to a slow negotiation tactic.  While I could try to push further, there's a risk she'll dig in or I'll waste time and end up paying John's price anyway.  $11,250 is a decent savings, and it's time to close the deal."
