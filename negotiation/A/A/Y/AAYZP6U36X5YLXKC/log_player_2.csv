Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I like the spirit of compromise, Bob! However, I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway again. How about $112.50? It's a fair price, and I think you'll be happy with the product.

It's clear Alice is unlikely to go below $110.  While we could try to negotiate further, we're running out of rounds and risk ending up with no deal. John offers a guaranteed price of $100, which is a better outcome at this point."
