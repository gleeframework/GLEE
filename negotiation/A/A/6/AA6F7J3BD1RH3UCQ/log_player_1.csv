"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100.  It's a great deal and I think you'll be happy with it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting at $100, which is higher than what the product is worth to Bob, but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive tone:**  Using a friendly and encouraging tone might help Bob feel more inclined to negotiate. 
* **Leaving room for counteroffers:** I'm not going to go all-in on the first offer,  I want to see if I can get closer to my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $100 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aiming for more:**  While $90 is closer to my minimum price, I'm still holding out for a bit more. I'm confident that with more negotiation, I can get closer to my target.
* **Testing the waters:** I want to see if Bob is truly willing to pay closer to $100. 
* **Keeping the option to sell to John open:** It's important to remember that I have a backup option with John. This gives me leverage in the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $95? It's a fair price for both of us, and we can close the deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** By proposing $95, I'm showing a willingness to compromise while still staying above my minimum price.
* **Highlighting fairness:** Emphasizing a ""fair price"" for both of us can appeal to Bob's sense of reason and make him feel like he's getting a good deal. 
* **Closing the deal:** I'm suggesting that this could be the final price, encouraging Bob to agree.

This approach attempts to strike a balance between getting a better price and keeping the negotiation moving forward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you want to split the difference, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $95. How about we meet at $92? That's the highest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** $92 is only $8 away from my minimum of $120. While I'd prefer more, it's a reasonable offer.
* **Time pressure:**  We are already in round 4, and the longer the negotiation goes, the more risk there is that I'll lose Bob as a buyer.
* **Potential for further negotiations:**  Even if I accept this offer, I can still try to negotiate additional benefits or a future deal with Bob, as he seems open to negotiation. 

It's a calculated risk, but accepting the offer seems like the best option at this point to secure a sale and avoid potential loss."
