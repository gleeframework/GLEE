"I'm interested in the product, but $100 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",90.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $95? It's a fair price for both of us, and we can close the deal. What do you say?",95.0,Alice,3,

"I understand you want to split the difference, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $95. How about we meet at $92? That's the highest I'm willing to go.",92.0,Bob,4,
