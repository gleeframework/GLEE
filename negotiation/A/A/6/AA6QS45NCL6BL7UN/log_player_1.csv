# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000.

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price. I'm going to try to negotiate further."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to accept that price yet.  I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000, which still reflects the value of the product.  Let's meet in the middle and make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
