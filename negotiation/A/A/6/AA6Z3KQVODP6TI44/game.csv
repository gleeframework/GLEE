"Thank you for offering the product. I appreciate your enthusiasm and believe it could be valuable. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the asking price of $1500000. Would you consider a lower offer, perhaps closer to $1200000?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1200000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $1400000. What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. While $1400000 is closer to what I'm comfortable with, I still believe we can find a better middle ground. Could you possibly lower the price to $1350000?",1350000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see you're a serious buyer, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $1350000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I can offer it to you for $1380000. What do you think?",1380000.0,Alice,5,

"Thank you for your flexibility, Alice. I understand your position and appreciate your efforts to reach an agreement. Considering my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price of $1360000. This might help us close the gap and move forward with the transaction.",1360000.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your continued interest, Bob, and I'm willing to meet you at $1360000. However, I'm still not at my minimum price. I can offer it to you for $1390000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I hope we can finalize the deal here.",1390000.0,Alice,7,
