"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $140 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $160.  That's still a great deal for a product that's worth a lot more. What do you say?",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $160 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about we split the difference and go with $155? It's a fair price for both of us.",155.0,Bob,4,
