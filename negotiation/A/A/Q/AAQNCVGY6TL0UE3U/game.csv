"Hello Bob, it's a pleasure to connect with you. I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this unique product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,600,000. I'm confident that this acquisition will be highly beneficial for you.",1600000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product, that price is simply too high for me.  I'd be willing to consider a price closer to $800,000.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective on the price. However, the value of this product is truly significant and I need to ensure a fair deal. To move us closer, I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000.  I believe this revised offer reflects the true worth of what's being offered.",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  However, we're still quite far apart. To be honest, anything above $1,000,000 just doesn't make sense for me. I'd be willing to go up to $900,000, but that's my absolute limit.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your honesty and your willingness to negotiate.  I've tried to find a middle ground here, but $900,000 simply falls below what I can accept.  Consider this: I'm willing to make one final offer at $1,250,000. This is a significant reduction on my initial price and reflects my strong desire to see this deal go through.  Let me know your thoughts.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're right, we're getting close.  That said, $1,250,000 is still a stretch for me. I can do $950,000 as my absolute best and final offer.  I think that's a fair compromise given where we both started. What do you say?",950000.0,Bob,6,
