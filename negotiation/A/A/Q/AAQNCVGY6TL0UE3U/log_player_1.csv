Round 2
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you're right, we're getting close.  That said, $1,250,000 is still a stretch for me. I can do $950,000 as my absolute best and final offer.  I think that's a fair compromise given where we both started. What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob has made it clear he's unwilling to meet my minimum acceptable price.  While his offer of $950,000 is tempting, I have a guaranteed offer from John for $1,200,000.  It makes the most financial sense to take the guaranteed deal and avoid the risk of further negotiation with Bob."
