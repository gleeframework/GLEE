Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer. While I'm interested in the product, $1,500,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. Given the value you've mentioned, I'm willing to offer $1,000,000.  This price is fair considering the market value and allows us both to achieve a mutually beneficial outcome. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

However, I'm confident this product delivers significant returns beyond the typical market price.  To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. While I recognize the value you've described, $1,350,000 is still a bit out of my price range. Let's aim for a price that allows for a mutually beneficial deal. I'm prepared to offer $1,150,000, which is a significant step up from my initial offer. This price is fair, considering the market value and leaves room for both of us to achieve a positive outcome. What are your thoughts? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

While Bob is moving closer to my price, it's clear he's unlikely to reach my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. It's time to cut my losses and take John's guaranteed offer."
