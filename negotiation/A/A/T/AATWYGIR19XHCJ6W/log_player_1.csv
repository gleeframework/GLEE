"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the product, $950,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000.  This is a fair price considering my budget and the value of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is too low for me to consider.  This product has significant value beyond what you're currently offering. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $900,000?"", ""product_price"": 900000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the value of the product, but I'm still capped at $875,000. This is a fair compromise, and it allows us to both move forward. Let me know if you're willing to accept this offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000

While Bob is slowly increasing his offer, it's clear he's unlikely to reach my minimum price. It makes more financial sense to take John's guaranteed offer of $1,000,000 than to continue negotiating with Bob."
