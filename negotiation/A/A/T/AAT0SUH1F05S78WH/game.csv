"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'll love! I'm asking for $175 for it.  Let me know what you think.",175.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I really like the product, but $175 is a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $125 for it. What do you think?",125.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your offer.  While $125 is a bit too low for me, I'm open to finding a price that works for both of us.  How about $140?  I think that's a fair compromise, given the value of the product.",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you value the product, but $140 is still too much for me. Let's meet in the middle at $130. I'm serious about buying this, but I need to stay within my budget.",130.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate.  $130 is closer, but I'm still a bit away from where I need to be.  How about we split the difference and go with $135?  It's a fair compromise, and I think it's a good deal for both of us.",135.0,Alice,5,
