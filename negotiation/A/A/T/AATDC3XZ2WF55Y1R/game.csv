"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a unique asset. As we start our negotiation, I'm willing to offer you the product at a price of $900,000.

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer! While I agree the product is valuable, I'm working with a slightly tighter budget. Would you consider $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your honesty about your budget. However, I'm still looking for a price that reflects the product's true value to you. Considering your offer, I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a price of $850,000. This is a compromise that I believe is fair and reasonable, given the product's worth to you.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. $850,000 is getting closer, but to make this work on my end, I'd need to be closer to $800,000. Would that be feasible?",800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, Bob, and I'm willing to continue negotiating. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price being too close to the minimum value I'm willing to accept. Considering your offer, I'm willing to meet you at $825,000. This is a compromise that I believe is still reasonable, given the product's worth to you.",825000.0,Alice,5,
