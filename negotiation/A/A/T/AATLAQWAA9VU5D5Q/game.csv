"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,150,000.  It's a great deal, as you know it's worth $1,200,000 to you.  Let me know what you think.",1150000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to get a better price. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000.  This is a fair price, considering the product is only worth $1,000,000 to you. Let's make this deal happen.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,050,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need something closer to my initial offer. How about $1,100,000? This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product to you. Let's make this happen.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1,075,000.  This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away with a good deal. Let's finalize this now.",1075000.0,Bob,4,
