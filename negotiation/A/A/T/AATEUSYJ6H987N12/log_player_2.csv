"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1200000. It's a unique opportunity, and I believe it's worth a premium. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  While Alice's offer is at your maximum price, there's no reason to accept immediately.  You have 10 rounds, and it's worth exploring if you can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $1,200,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'd be willing to pay $1,000,000.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**  

* **Opening the Negotiation:** This counteroffer starts the negotiation process by clearly showing Alice that you're interested but want a lower price.
* **Aggressive but Reasonable:** $1,000,000 is a significant discount, but it's not so low that it would be immediately insulting.
* **Keeping Options Open:**  By offering a specific price, you're giving Alice a concrete number to work with."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position. However, $1000000 is still below my desired price point. I'm willing to come down to $1100000. This reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair negotiation. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's Offer:**  Alice has moved from her initial $1,200,000 down to $1,100,000, which shows willingness to negotiate. However, you're still aiming for a better price. 
* **Negotiation Strategy:** It's worth continuing the negotiations.  You've successfully gotten her to lower her price, and there's still room for further compromise.
* **Potential for a Better Deal:**  You've already shown that you're serious about getting a good deal, and Alice will likely be more willing to move if she wants to close the deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $1,100,000 is getting closer, but I'm still looking to get this product for $1,050,000.  Let's split the difference and see if we can reach a deal."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Continuing to Compromise:**  This counteroffer shows that you're willing to meet Alice halfway, but are still pushing for a lower price.
* **Motivating Alice:**  Offering a specific price point makes it clear what you're aiming for and encourages Alice to consider a compromise.
* **Maintaining Leverage:**  By not accepting her offer, you're demonstrating that you're not desperate to buy the product and have options (like John)."
