``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's below my minimum but gives Bob a good deal.  It leaves room for negotiation, but I'm also prepared to walk away and sell to John for $1,500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I see the value in the product, but $1,400,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $1,050,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum, and even lower than what it's worth to him.  I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,050,000 is simply too low. Let's find a compromise. I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000.  This is still a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 1250000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  While $1,250,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $1,100,000. Would you be willing to meet in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still below my minimum.  I'm going to counteroffer again to see if we can reach an agreement.  If he rejects this, I'll be happy to sell to John for $1,500,000."
