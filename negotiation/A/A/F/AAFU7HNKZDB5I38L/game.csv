"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,400,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $1,000,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This is still a fair price considering the value to you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you moving a bit. How about we meet in the middle at $1,150,000? ",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,150,000 still isn't quite there for me. How about we split the difference and go with $1,275,000? That's a good middle ground and allows us both to walk away feeling satisfied.",1275000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, you're getting closer.  I'd be willing to go up to $1,200,000. That's a fair offer, and I'm hoping we can close this out.",1200000.0,Bob,6,
