"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,400,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $1,000,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

I'm not willing to sell the product for $1,000,000. It's worth more to me than that. I'll try to negotiate with Bob further."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $1,000,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This is still a fair price considering the value to you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1300000}

While $1,150,000 is tempting, I'm still aiming for a higher price. I'll try to counteroffer again."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,150,000 still isn't quite there for me. How about we split the difference and go with $1,275,000? That's a good middle ground and allows us both to walk away feeling satisfied."", ""product_price"": 1275000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you're getting closer.  I'd be willing to go up to $1,200,000. That's a fair offer, and I'm hoping we can close this out.

Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is the same as what John is offering.  It's time to stop negotiating with Bob and sell the product to John."
