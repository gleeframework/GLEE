"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. After careful consideration, we believe it's worth $12000 to you. We're looking forward to your response. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is at your maximum price point. It's advantageous to try and negotiate a lower price.  There are 9 more rounds, so there's time to potentially secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your product, $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $10,500. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer starts the negotiation by showing Alice you're serious about buying but are also willing to pay a bit less than her initial price. This is a reasonable starting point, as it's still above Alice's minimum price point and leaves room for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and would like to make a counteroffer. Considering the value you place on our product, I propose a price of $11500. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has moved closer to your desired price point, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting her offer keeps the negotiation open and allows you to potentially secure a price closer to $10,500. There are still several rounds remaining, so you have time to see if you can close the deal at a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $11,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm comfortable paying $11,000. If you're willing to meet me there, I'm ready to close the deal."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer again shows a willingness to negotiate while remaining firm on your price point.  You've moved closer to Alice's last offer, demonstrating a desire to reach an agreement while still keeping the negotiation in your favor."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your feedback, Bob. I'm glad to see we're getting closer. Considering the value you see in our product, I propose a final price of $10800. This is my best offer, and I hope it aligns with what you're looking for. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $10,800 is a good deal for Bob. It's lower than his maximum price point of $12,000 and closer to his desired price point of $10,500.  There are still a few rounds remaining, but it's unlikely Alice will drop her price much further.  Accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product at a reasonable price while also avoiding the risk of needing to buy from John at a higher price."
