"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm happy to make you an offer. I'm willing to sell it to you for $11,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value it brings to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $11,000 is a good price, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I'm interested,  $11,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. Would you be willing to come down to $10,500? "", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that the product will bring significant value to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10,800. I think this is a fair compromise that balances our interests. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered the price from $11,000 to $10,800, which is a significant decrease. Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible, and this price is within his budget and provides a decent saving compared to John's price.  There's always a risk of further negotiation, but accepting this offer minimizes the potential for a longer negotiation process and ensures a purchase within his desired price range."
