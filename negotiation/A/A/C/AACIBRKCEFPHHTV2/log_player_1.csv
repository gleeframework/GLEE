Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Given the value to me is $12,000, I'm willing to offer $13,000.  This is a fair price considering your value and my value, and allows us both to make a profitable deal.  Let me know what you think! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000.
