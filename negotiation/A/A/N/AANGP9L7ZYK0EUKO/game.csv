"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, but $12,500 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to get at least $13,500 to make this worthwhile. Let's try to find a middle ground.",13500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. I'm still a bit too high at $13,500.  How about we split the difference at $13,000? This would be a win-win for both of us. ",13000.0,Bob,4,
