"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $14,000 is better than $15,000, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to explore a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $12,500.  This feels like a fair price considering the value to both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:** This counteroffer starts at a price that is close to Alice's minimum acceptable price, but still provides room for negotiation.
* **Fairness:** The message emphasizes the idea of a fair deal for both parties, increasing the chances of Alice considering the offer.
* **Room for Negotiation:** The price of $12,500 leaves room for Alice to counter back, ensuring the negotiation process continues."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, but $12,500 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to get at least $13,500 to make this worthwhile. Let's try to find a middle ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Room for Negotiation:**  While $13,500 is a better price than John's offer, there's still room for Alice to come down further.
* **Potential for Lower Price:** By rejecting the offer, Bob can continue to negotiate and potentially secure a price closer to his desired $12,500. 
* **Risk of Reaching a Deadlock:** However, there is a risk that if Bob continues to reject offers, Alice might become unwilling to negotiate further, forcing Bob to buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. I'm still a bit too high at $13,500.  How about we split the difference at $13,000? This would be a win-win for both of us. "", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** This counteroffer shows a willingness to compromise by splitting the difference between Alice's last offer and Bob's previous offer.
* **Focus on Win-Win:** The message emphasizes the benefit for both parties, increasing the likelihood of Alice accepting.
* **Strategic Move:** Offering $13,000 leaves room for a potential counteroffer from Alice, keeping the negotiation active."
