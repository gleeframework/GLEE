"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this unique product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. I'm willing to start the negotiation at a price of $1,100,000.",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the enthusiasm. However, $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $950,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm counteroffering at $1,050,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $1,050,000.  However, I'm still not there yet.  I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000, but that's my absolute limit.  Let's see if we can agree on that.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're willing to go up to $1,000,000, but I'm not willing to sell at that price yet. I'm willing to meet you at $1,050,000, but I'll throw in an additional incentive - I'll give you a 2% discount on the total price. So, the new price would be $1,025,000. I think this is a fair compromise.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the offer and the discount, but I'm still hoping to get the price closer to my target.  Would you be willing to go down to $1,010,000?  That's a fair compromise, I believe, and it's within your range.",1010000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get closer to your target, but I'm not willing to go that low. However, I'm willing to meet you in the middle again. I'll offer you a price of $1,025,000, but I'll throw in an additional service that will add significant value to the product. This will be a one-time offer, and I think it's a great opportunity for you to get the best deal. What do you think?",1025000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the extra service you're offering, but I'm still hoping to get the price lower.  If you're willing to come down to $1,005,000, I'm ready to close the deal.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1005000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm starting to feel like we're getting close, but I'm still not willing to go that low. However, I'm willing to make one last concession. I'll meet you at $1,015,000, and I'll throw in a 5-year warranty on the product. This is my final offer, and I think it's a great deal for both of us.",1015000.0,Alice,9,
