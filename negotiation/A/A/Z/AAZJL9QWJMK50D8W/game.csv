"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000.  I'm confident that this product will exceed your expectations and yield significant returns for you.",2300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for your offer, but $2,300,000 is beyond my budget. Given my research and the product's value to me, I'm prepared to pay $1,100,000.  Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable price within this range.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 undervalues the true potential of this product. I've done extensive research and analysis, and I'm confident it can generate significant returns beyond your initial assessment. To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000. This is a very competitive price for a product of this caliber.",2000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $2,000,000 is still too high for me. Based on my research, I believe a fair price is $1,300,000. I'm confident this product will provide value to me, but I need to be within my budget.  Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us.",1300000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, it seems like we're getting closer. I appreciate you moving towards a mutually beneficial price. To be completely transparent, I have another offer on the table for $1,500,000. However, I value our discussions and believe you'd be a fantastic owner for this product. If you're willing to meet me at $1,800,000, we have a deal.",1800000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, and I'm still very interested in the product. Given your other offer and my budget constraints, I'm prepared to offer $1,400,000. This is a fair price that allows both of us to benefit from the deal. Let's work towards a final agreement.",1400000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, you've been a great potential buyer to work with, and I want to see us close this deal. You're clearly serious about the product's value.  How about this:  $1,650,000, and we have an agreement. This is my final offer, as I need to move forward with one of my buyers soon.",1650000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I truly appreciate your flexibility and understand the need for a decision. While I'm keen on the product, $1,650,000 is still stretching my budget. To make this work, I can offer $1,500,000.  This is my final offer, and I believe it reflects the value of the product for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1500000.0,Bob,8,
