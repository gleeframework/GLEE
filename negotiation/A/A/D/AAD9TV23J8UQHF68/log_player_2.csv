"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this incredible product, knowing its value to you. I'm asking for $1,000,000. This price reflects its unique benefits and represents a great opportunity for you. Let's discuss further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer of $1,000,000 is still too high.  Since you're willing to pay up to $1,200,000, there's room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,000,000 is still above my initial budget.  I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product.  This reflects the value I see in it and is a fair price considering our mutual benefits.  Let's work towards a deal that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective and appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $900,000 is a step closer, it's still below the value I'm seeking. I'm willing to come down to $950,000, reflecting both the product's worth and the potential for a successful partnership.  Let's bridge this gap and finalize the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $950,000, but you're still aiming to save more.  It's worth continuing the negotiation and seeing if you can get her to come down further.  There's still room for compromise, and you don't want to settle prematurely."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my offer.  However, $950,000 is still a bit high for me.  Let's meet in the middle at $925,000.  This price acknowledges the value of the product and ensures a fair deal for both of us.  I'm confident we can reach an agreement that works for everyone."", ""product_price"": 925000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $925,000 is a fair offer, but I'm still holding out for a slightly higher price to reflect the product's unique benefits and the value it brings to your business.  Let's compromise at $940,000. This price allows for a good deal for both of us.  Let's make this happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $940,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $940,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $940,000, which is very close to your last counteroffer of $925,000. It's a good price for you, and it seems likely Alice won't go lower.  At this point, you're close to a deal, and it's not worth risking further negotiations. You're saving a significant amount compared to buying from John, and the risk of losing the deal is increasing."
