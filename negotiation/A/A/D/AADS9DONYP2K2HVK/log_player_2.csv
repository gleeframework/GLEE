"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start the negotiation at a price of $1,400,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,300,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can do $1,350,000, which is a great deal for both of us. What do you think?
