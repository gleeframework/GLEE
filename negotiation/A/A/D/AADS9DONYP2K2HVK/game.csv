"Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $1,400,000 is a bit out of my price range. I'm very interested in the product, but I can only offer $1,300,000 at this time.  Let me know what you think.",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,300,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can do $1,350,000, which is a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",1350000.0,Alice,3,
