"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product for a one-time price of $18,000. It's a unique opportunity to get a product worth $10,000 to you for a great deal. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $18,000 is significantly more than Bob's maximum budget of $10,000.  It makes sense to try and negotiate a lower price before considering buying from John."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're looking to make a deal, but $12,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering $14,000. It's a fair price that still gives you a great value for the product, and it's closer to what I'm looking for. Let me know if this works for you!

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While $14,000 is better than $18,000, it's still above Bob's budget.  It makes sense to continue negotiating to try and get a price closer to $12,000 or even lower."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to go up to $13,000, but I'm still a bit below my target. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'm counteroffering $13,500. This is the lowest price I'm comfortable with, and I think it's a great deal for both of us. Let me know if this works for you!

Bob should choose to buy from John.  While Alice has come down to $13,500, this is still higher than Bob's budget and the price John is offering. It makes more sense to buy from John and save the additional $3,500."
