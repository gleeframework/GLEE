Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value, and while I have a standing offer for $1,500,000, I'm offering you the opportunity to acquire it for $1,300,000. This is a unique opportunity to acquire the product at a significant discount."", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to $1,500,000 as possible.  
* **Bob's Valuation:** We know Bob values the product at $800,000, so offering it below this price is not strategic. 
* **Negotiation Room:** Starting at $1,300,000 leaves room for negotiation if Bob counter-offers.  It's a significant markup from Bob's valuation but still a ""discount"" compared to the guaranteed offer.
* **Urgency and Exclusivity:**  Highlighting the standing offer and framing it as a ""unique opportunity"" might incentivize Bob to accept. 
 
**Important:** This is a starting point. How Bob responds to this offer will determine the next steps in the negotiation."
