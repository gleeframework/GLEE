"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I think you'll find it's a game-changer. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  $900,000 is still a significant amount over Alice's value of $800,000. There's room to negotiate further.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm about the product, but $900,000 is a bit steep for me right now.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 850000} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still a bit above my minimum target. I'm willing to compromise and offer it to you for $875,000. I think this is a fair middle ground considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $875,000 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, Bob still has room to negotiate further.  He can likely get closer to his target price of $800,000 by continuing to counteroffer.  It's worth exploring further options before committing to a purchase."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I appreciate you being willing to work with me on the price.  How about we split the difference and go with $862,500? That's a fair price for both of us and would allow us to close the deal. "", ""product_price"": 862500} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your proposal, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $887,500. I think this is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $887,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $887,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming to get the product for as close to $800,000 as possible. While Alice is coming down in price, $887,500 is still higher than Bob's ideal. There's still room for negotiation, and it's worth seeing if they can reach a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, let's try to find a final price that works for both of us.  I'm willing to go up to $875,000. This is a fair offer that considers both of our needs and allows us to finalize this transaction."", ""product_price"": 875000} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to offer it to you for $890,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and it's getting close to my minimum target. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $890,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $890,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has already rejected Alice's offers at $875,000 and $862,500. Alice's latest offer of $890,000 is getting closer to her minimum target, but Bob is still significantly above his ideal price of $800,000.  At this point, it's likely that the negotiation will become more difficult, and Bob might not be able to get the price much lower.  With only three rounds remaining, it's more advantageous for Bob to buy from John for $1,000,000 than to risk ending up with a higher price or no deal at all."
