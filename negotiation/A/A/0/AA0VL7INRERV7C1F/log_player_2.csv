(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting very close to your desired price, you have 3 rounds left and it's still worthwhile to try and get a better deal.  It's possible to squeeze out a little more savings, and you're still far enough away from your absolute limit that rejecting doesn't risk losing the deal entirely."

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thank you for your persistence and for coming down to $855,000. We appreciate your commitment to this deal. In response, we are willing to accept a price of $860,000 for the product. This price still maintains a healthy profit margin for us while being competitive with your offer. We believe this is a fair compromise and hope it will help us conclude this transaction. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $860,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $860,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is the last round, and Alice's offer is $60,000 above your ideal price, but still significantly better than what John would charge. You've already rejected several offers, and there's no guarantee Alice will accept a counteroffer. Accepting this offer is the best way to ensure you get the product at a reasonable price."
