"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","I'll start by making an offer to Bob. Since the product is worth $100 to me, I'll aim to get as close to that price as possible. I'll offer Bob the product for:

{""product_price"": $90}

This is a reasonable price, considering the product is worth $80 to Bob. Let's see how he reacts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","Bob's offer is lower than I expected, but I still need to consider my options. Since the product is worth $100 to me, I'm not willing to sell it for $75. I'll choose option (2) and reject Bob's offer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll make a counteroffer to try to get a better price. I'll offer Bob the product for:

{""product_price"": $85}

Let's see how Bob reacts to this revised offer!"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Since Bob rejected my initial offer and I rejected his counteroffer, I'll make another counteroffer that's slightly higher than my previous one. I'll offer Bob the product for:

{""product_price"": $87.50}

This price is still below my target of $100, but it's a reasonable compromise considering the product is worth $80 to Bob. Let's see if Bob is willing to meet me halfway!"

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll make another counteroffer to try to get a better price. I'll offer Bob the product for:

{""product_price"": $92.50}

This price is getting closer to my target, but I'm still willing to negotiate. Let's see if Bob is willing to meet me at this price!"
