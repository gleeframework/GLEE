"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start the conversation with an initial offer of $1,200,000, which is the minimum price I'm willing to accept.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go at this time. I'm very interested in this product, and I'm prepared to pay $950,000. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in the product.  I hope we can reach a mutually agreeable solution.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thank you for your counteroffer of $950,000. I appreciate your interest in the product and understand that it's a bit above your budget. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $950,000, as it's below my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering $1,075,000. I believe this price is a fair compromise considering the value the product brings to you and the minimum price I'm willing to accept.",1075000.0,Alice,3,
