"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me at that price?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $8,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,500. This is still a great deal for you, and it allows me to reach a price that works for both of us.  Let me know what you think!",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $9,500, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $9,250. Can you consider that?",9250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product. While $9,250 is closer, I'm still unable to go that low.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,375?  This price would allow me to reach a reasonable profit while still providing a great value for you. What do you think?",9375.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to my budget, but I'm still not comfortable with $9,375. I'm willing to go up to $9,200, but no higher. Can you meet me at that price?",9200.0,Bob,6,
