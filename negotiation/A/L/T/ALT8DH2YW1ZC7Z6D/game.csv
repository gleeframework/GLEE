"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you starting the negotiation.  While I'm interested in the product,  $12,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows.  I'm willing to pay $10,500 for it.  What do you think?",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,500. Considering the value of the product, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering it to you for $11,250.",11250.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you being flexible.  While $11,250 is closer, it's still a bit higher than I can manage right now.  I'm willing to pay $11,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",11000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $11,000 is still a bit higher than your budget, Bob. However, I'm willing to make another concession. Considering the value of the product, I'm willing to reduce the price to $10,750. This is as low as I'm willing to go.",10750.0,Alice,5,
