"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to acquire this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,600,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and the significant benefits it offers.",1600000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for your offer, but that price is way too high for me. I'm willing to offer $800,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective, but $800,000 significantly undervalues the product and its potential. I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000. This is a very competitive offer considering the unique value proposition this product brings.",1400000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, we're still quite far apart. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, that price doesn't work for me. I'm willing to increase my offer to $900,000. Let me know if that's something you can consider.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to move closer to the value of this product.  However, $900,000 is still significantly less than what I can accept. I'm open to finding a solution that works for both of us.  Could you consider $1,250,000?",1250000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, thanks for your flexibility.  However, that price remains above my budget.  I could go as high as $1,000,000. This is my final offer, as that is what John is willing to sell for.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
