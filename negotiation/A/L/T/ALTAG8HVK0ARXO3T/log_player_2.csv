"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm aiming for a price around $1,150,000.  What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer of $1,150,000 is better than John's price of $1,200,000, Bob can potentially get a better deal by negotiating with Alice.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but I'm looking to spend a bit less.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you coming back with an offer.  I'm willing to negotiate, but $1,050,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is a good deal for Bob. It's lower than John's price of $1,200,000 and also closer to Bob's ideal price. While further negotiation might be possible, the risk of Alice rejecting further counteroffers and ultimately leading to buying from John at a higher price makes accepting this offer the best choice."
