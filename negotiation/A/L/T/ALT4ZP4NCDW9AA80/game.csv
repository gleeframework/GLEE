"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we begin our negotiation, I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000. This is a great starting point, and I'm open to negotiations. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate the opportunity to discuss this product with you. However, $950,000 is a bit higher than I'm currently comfortable with. I'm interested in the product, but I'm looking to pay closer to $750,000.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $825,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $825,000 is closer, but I'm still hoping to find a price that's a bit lower.  I'm willing to offer $800,000 for the product.  This is a significant investment for me, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects the value we both see in the product.",800000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, Bob. However, I've already compromised significantly by offering $825,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. I'm now offering the product to you for $815,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a great value considering the product's worth to you. What do you think?",815000.0,Alice,5,
