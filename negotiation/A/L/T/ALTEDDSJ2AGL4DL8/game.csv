"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-value asset. My initial offer is $1,200,000. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm looking to get at least $1,500,000 for the product.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, $1,200,000 is still a bit high for me.  While I recognize the value of this product, I'm only willing to pay $850,000 at this time.  I'm confident that this is a fair offer, considering I have other options available.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to make an offer, but $850,000 is below my minimum target. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my target price. My revised offer is $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the market conditions.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,100,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $950,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer and a good compromise.  I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your flexibility, but $950,000 is still below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to get closer to my target price. My revised offer is $1,050,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the market conditions. I'm getting a bit concerned that we might not reach an agreement, so I'm willing to make one more concession to try to close the deal.",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand you need to get a good price, but $1,150,000 is still more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $1,050,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer and a fair price considering the market conditions. This is my final offer.

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,050,000 is still $450,000 below my target. I'm getting close to my limit, but I need to get as close to $1,500,000 as possible.
