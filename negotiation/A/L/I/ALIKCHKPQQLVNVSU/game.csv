"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. I'm willing to make a serious investment in this product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget. Can you consider my counteroffer?",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position. While I appreciate your interest, $750,000 is simply too low for me.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This represents a significant discount, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.  Consider this my final offer.",850000.0,Alice,3,
