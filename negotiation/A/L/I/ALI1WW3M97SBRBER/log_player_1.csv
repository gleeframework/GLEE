Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm pleased to offer you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I know it would be incredibly valuable to you, considering its potential. I'm proposing a price of $925,000. This is a fair deal considering its worth. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 925000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  We want to get as close as possible to Bob's $1,000,000 valuation without pushing him away.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $925,000 leaves some space for Bob to potentially negotiate a bit, while still securing a significant profit for Alice.
* **Alternative Option:**  It's important to remember John's offer of $800,000 acts as a safety net.  Alice is guaranteed at least that amount, so the offer to Bob aims higher."
