Alice's offer is higher than what she values the product for, leaving room for negotiation. I should make a counteroffer to try and get a better price."

While Alice is moving closer to my desired price, there's still room for negotiation. I'll reject this offer and propose a counteroffer that's closer to my target price."

Alice is unlikely to go much lower, and this price is a good compromise. Accepting the offer at $11,250 saves me a significant amount compared to buying from John."
