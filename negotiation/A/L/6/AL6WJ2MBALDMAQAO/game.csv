"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $2000000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm interested in this product, but I can only offer $1200000 at this time.  Let me know what you think.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While $1200000 is below my minimum, I'm willing to compromise slightly to facilitate this deal.  I'm prepared to lower the price to $1700000.  This reflects the unique value of this product and allows for some wiggle room for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1700000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1700000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm prepared to go up to $1400000. This is a fair price for both of us, given the product's value and my budget. Let's see if we can agree on this.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
