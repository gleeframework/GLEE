"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand you're looking to spend less, but I'm not willing to go as low as $90. How about we meet in the middle at $110? It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $110 is still a bit too high for me. I'm happy to meet you halfway between our last offers at $100.  Let me know what you think.",100.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go down to $100. I'm willing to compromise a bit more, though. How about we meet at $115? It's still a good price for the product, and I think you'll be happy with it.",115.0,Alice,5,
