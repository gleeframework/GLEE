"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this exceptional product, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire it at a fair price. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,300,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer:** $1,300,000
* **Your maximum budget:** $1,500,000
* **John's price:** $1,500,000

Since you can get the product from John for your maximum budget, it makes sense to reject Alice's offer. You can then negotiate with John or try to find another seller."
