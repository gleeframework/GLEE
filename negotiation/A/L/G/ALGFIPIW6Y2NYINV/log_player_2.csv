# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a great product for you that I think you'll really love.  I'm offering it to you for $100. This is a fantastic deal as it's worth a lot more to you. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice's offer of $100 is below your $120 maximum, you can likely get a better price. Rejecting her offer might lead her to propose a lower price, or you can always buy from John for $120."
