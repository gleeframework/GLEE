"Hi Bob, I understand that $175 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $135. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product at this price.",135.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $135 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm sticking with my original offer of $100. If you're not willing to accept that, I'll have to consider buying from John.",100.0,Bob,4,
