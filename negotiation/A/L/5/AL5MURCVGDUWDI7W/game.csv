"I appreciate your enthusiasm, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,200,000 doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  Let's find a middle ground.  I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This allows for a healthy margin for both of us.  I'm confident this product will be a game-changer for you, and I'm eager to see you succeed with it.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice, but I'm still not convinced that $1,350,000 is the right price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think a more reasonable price would be $1,225,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1225000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,225,000 still feels a bit too low.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This is a fair price considering the significant potential of this product.  I believe we're close to a mutually beneficial agreement.  Let's work together to make this happen.",1300000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still not ready to meet at $1,300,000. I'm willing to go up to $1,275,000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1275000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,275,000 is still significantly below the value of this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I'm offering $1,287,500. This is a very fair price, given the potential this product offers. Let's finalize this deal. ",1287500.0,Alice,7,
