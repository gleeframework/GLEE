"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth $120 to you, and we're looking to maximize our earnings. Let's start with an offer of $110. We believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $110 is a good price, Bob's goal is to save as much as possible. There are still 9 rounds to negotiate and potentially get a lower price.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to explore counter-offers and potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, $110 is still a bit high for me.  Given the value to me, I'm willing to pay $105.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. We appreciate your willingness to meet us halfway. Considering the value of the product to both of us, let's aim for a mutual agreement. Our counteroffer is $107.50. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $107.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $107.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to Bob's desired price.  While a bit higher than his initial counteroffer, $107.50 is still within Bob's budget and a decent savings compared to John's price. It's a good compromise and a fair price considering there are fewer rounds left to negotiate."
