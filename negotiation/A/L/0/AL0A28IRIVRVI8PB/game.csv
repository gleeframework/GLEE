"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm definitely interested but $13,000 is a bit high for me.  Would you consider $11,500? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",11500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  $11,500 is a bit lower than I'd hoped for, but I'm willing to compromise. How about we split the difference and go with $12,250?  I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us.",12250.0,Alice,3,
