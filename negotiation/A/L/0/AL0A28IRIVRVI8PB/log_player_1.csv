Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product I think you'll be very interested in. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $13,000.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

This offer is strategic for a few reasons:

* **It's a strong starting point:** It's significantly higher than my minimum but leaves room for negotiation.
* **It's a clear signal:** It shows Bob that I'm serious about selling but also value the product.
* **It's a good starting point for counteroffers:**  Bob will likely counter, and I'm prepared to negotiate further. 

I'll be ready to accept a counteroffer if it's close to my desired price, or I can make a counteroffer of my own.  If Bob proves unreasonable, I can always go with John's offer of $10,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm definitely interested but $13,000 is a bit high for me.  Would you consider $11,500? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still lower than my desired price. I'm going to counter with my own offer. I believe there's still room to negotiate and get a better price. I can make a counteroffer that's closer to my initial offer, but not so high as to scare Bob off completely."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  $11,500 is a bit lower than I'd hoped for, but I'm willing to compromise. How about we split the difference and go with $12,250?  I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 12250}
``` 

I'm offering to split the difference between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. This signals that I'm flexible and willing to negotiate, while still staying within my desired price range. This approach increases the chances of reaching a mutually agreeable price."
