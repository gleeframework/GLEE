Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the opportunity, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but given my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price closer to what I can afford. My counteroffer is $1,400,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but my initial offer considered the product's true value. I'm willing to negotiate, so let's meet halfway. I'll lower my price to $1,700,000."",
""product_price"": 1700000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. While I understand the value of the product, I still believe we can find a middle ground. My counteroffer is $1,600,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

While I could push for more, accepting Bob's offer of $1,600,000 is the best choice at this point. It's a significant profit above my minimum, and continuing to negotiate risks losing the sale altogether."
