Round 2
Bob's offer:

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $9,500 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to try and negotiate a higher price with Bob in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $9,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500.  This is still a fair price for both of us, and I believe you'll find the product to be worth every penny.  Let's make a deal!"", ""product_price"": 10500}

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. I'm still determined to get a price closer to my minimum. I'm going to try one more counteroffer before considering selling to John."

I'm going to sell the product to John for $12,000.  While I would prefer to sell to Bob, we've reached a stalemate, and it's becoming clear that we are too far apart on price. I can't afford to keep negotiating with Bob and risk losing out on a guaranteed sale to John."
