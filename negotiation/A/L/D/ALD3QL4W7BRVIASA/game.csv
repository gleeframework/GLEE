"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,500. That's my maximum budget for this product.",12500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $12,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $13,250. This is a fair compromise, considering the value of the product to both of us. Let me know your thoughts.",13250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit higher than $13,250. I'm willing to go up to $12,800. That's the highest I'm willing to pay for this product.",12800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I respect your position, but $12,800 just doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to go down to $13,000, but that's my final offer.  It's a fair price considering the value you place on the product and gives us both a good deal.",13000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $13,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'm offering $12,500. I think that's a fair price for both of us.",12500.0,Bob,6,
