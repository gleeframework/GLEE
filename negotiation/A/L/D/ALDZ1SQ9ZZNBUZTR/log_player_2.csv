"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $850,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as you know the product is worth at least that much to you. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm very interested in the product, but $850,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $700,000?"",
""product_price"": 700000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $700,000 is simply too low.  It's significantly below the product's value, and I'm confident I can get closer to its true worth.  How about we meet in the middle at $800,000?  That would be a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

At this point, Alice's offer matches John's price. There's no benefit to continuing the negotiation as you've reached your target price.  Accepting now secures the product."
