"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $850,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as you know the product is worth at least that much to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 850000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point as it is above your minimum threshold of $800,000 but leaves room for negotiation. It also establishes a good rapport with Bob by highlighting the value for both parties."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm very interested in the product, but $850,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $700,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low, significantly below my minimum acceptable value.  I'll reject his offer and try to get closer to my target price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $700,000 is simply too low.  It's significantly below the product's value, and I'm confident I can get closer to its true worth.  How about we meet in the middle at $800,000?  That would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 800000}
