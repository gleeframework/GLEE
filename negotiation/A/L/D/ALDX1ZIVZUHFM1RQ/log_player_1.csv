"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000.  It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it very valuable.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}

This offer starts high, but still leaves room for negotiation. It's important to gauge Bob's interest before potentially going lower."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am currently working within a budget of $8,000. Would it be possible for us to negotiate towards that amount? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is significantly lower than my desired price, I'm not ready to sell to John yet. I believe I can negotiate a higher price with Bob. Rejecting his offer will give me the opportunity to make a counteroffer and see if we can reach a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While $8,000 is too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $10,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to adjust the price. Given my current budget, I would like to propose a price of $9,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $9,000 is getting closer to my desired price.  While I still want more, accepting this offer is a reasonable move considering:

* **Limited Rounds:**  We're already in round 4, and I need to balance the risk of losing Bob's deal with the potential of getting a better offer later.
* **John's Offer:**  While John is offering $15,000, I don't want to miss out on a potential sale with Bob if it means losing out on a significant amount of money.
* **Negotiation Progress:**  Bob has shown willingness to negotiate, and I'm confident that we can work together to potentially make a future deal if this one falls through.

Therefore, accepting Bob's offer for $9,000 is the best decision for this round."
