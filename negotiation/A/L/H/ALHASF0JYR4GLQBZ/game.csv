"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a great starting point, and I'm open to discussing further. What are your thoughts?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm very interested in the product, and I'm willing to pay $750,000.  This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing you a good profit while giving me a solid deal.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $850,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you and my initial offer of $900,000. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $850,000 is closer to where I want to be, I'm still hoping to get a little closer to my initial offer. I'm prepared to pay $800,000 for the product.  This would be a great outcome for both of us, leaving us both satisfied with the deal. Let's see if we can make this happen.",800000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $800,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $825,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,5,
