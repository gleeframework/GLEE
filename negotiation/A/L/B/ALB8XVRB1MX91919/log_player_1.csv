Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000.  I believe this represents a fair deal considering its significant worth. Let me know your thoughts, and we can discuss further."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, you start negotiations significantly higher than Bob's perceived value.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** Offering it at $1,300,000 allows some room for Bob to negotiate while still staying well above his perceived value and close to your minimum acceptable price.
* **Highlighting value:** The message emphasizes the ""unique value"" and ""significant worth"" to justify the high price and potentially sway Bob's perception. 

**Goal:**  The aim is to secure a price as close to $1,300,000 as possible. If Bob rejects this offer, you can always fall back on John's guaranteed purchase at your desired price."
