Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000.  It's a great deal for you, and it's a good price for me.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is strategic:

* **It's above your minimum:** $14,000 is higher than your $12,000 minimum, so you're already making a profit.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  Bob values the product at $15,000, so he might be willing to pay a bit more than $14,000.
* **It's not too aggressive:**  A much higher price could make Bob immediately reject the offer.

This approach allows for a potential negotiation while still starting with a strong offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $12,500 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is above your minimum of $12,000, it's still significantly lower than your initial offer of $14,000.  You're likely to get a better price by continuing the negotiation.  

Here's why rejecting Bob's offer is the best strategy:

* **Potential for a Higher Price:**  There's a chance you can convince Bob to pay closer to your initial $14,000 price, as he's already expressed interest.
* **Avoiding a Loss:**  Selling to John for $12,000 would only give you your minimum, while continuing the negotiation offers the potential to make a larger profit. 

By rejecting Bob's offer, you maintain your negotiating power and can try to secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! I understand your offer, but $12,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little bit to $13,500. That's still a great price for you, and it's fair to me. Let's see if we can close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting Halfway:**  My counteroffer of $13,500 is exactly halfway between your initial offer of $14,000 and Bob's offer of $12,500. This shows flexibility and willingness to compromise while still protecting your interests.
* **Positive Tone:**  The message is friendly and encouraging, highlighting the benefits for Bob.  This helps maintain a positive relationship and encourages Bob to consider accepting the offer.
* **Fair Value:** $13,500 is still significantly higher than your minimum of $12,000, ensuring you make a profit. It's also likely to be appealing to Bob, who values the product at $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'd be willing to pay $13,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $13,000 is a good compromise. It's above your minimum of $12,000, ensuring you make a profit, and it's only $500 less than your last counteroffer.  

Here's why accepting is the best strategy:

* **Closing the Deal:** Continuing to negotiate could risk losing Bob entirely, especially as he's already expressed some hesitation.  
* **Minimizing Risk:**  While a higher price is always desirable, accepting $13,000 guarantees a sale and eliminates the chance of Bob backing out or going back to John.
* **Fair Value:**  $13,000 is a reasonable price, considering the value Bob places on the product and your initial goal of maximizing your earnings.

By accepting Bob's offer, you secure a good profit while minimizing the risk of losing the deal."
