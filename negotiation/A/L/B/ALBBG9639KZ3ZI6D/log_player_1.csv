Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm offering it to you for $175. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price above Bob's perceived value of $100, but still below my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** This leaves room for negotiation while ensuring I don't immediately lose a potential sale. 
* **Positive Tone:**  A friendly message can make Bob more receptive to negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer, but $175 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $120. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $120 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  
* **Opportunity for a counteroffer:**  I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price by making a counteroffer.
* **Selling to John is still an option:**  If the negotiation with Bob fails, I can still sell to John for $150, so I'm not in a rush to accept a low offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $120 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $140.  Let's find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 140}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-offer:**  This counteroffer is closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Positive tone:** The message remains friendly and encourages further negotiation. 
* **Leaving room:**  There's still some wiggle room for negotiation, which increases the chances of a successful deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $140 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $120.  It's the best I can do. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Stalemate:**  Bob is insistent on $120, which is far below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  
* **No room for further negotiation:**  I've already made a concession and there's no indication that Bob is willing to budge further.
* **Selling to John is the best option:**  By selling to John, I can secure my minimum acceptable price and avoid further potentially fruitless negotiations."
