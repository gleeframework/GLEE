"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'll be interested in. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $90. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $90 is less than John's price of $100, it's still above your $80 limit.  You haven't explored all your options with Alice yet. By rejecting this offer, you might be able to negotiate a better price with Alice, closer to your desired range."
