Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I have a product that I believe would be a great asset to your business.  I'm offering it to you for $1,000,000. This is a significant discount from its true value to me.  I understand this is a substantial investment, but I'm confident it will generate strong returns for you.  Let me know if you'd like to discuss this further."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:**  I'm offering the product for $1,000,000. This is a significant discount from my minimum acceptable value of $1,200,000.  It also leaves room for negotiation if Bob wants to counter-offer. 
* **Message:**  I'm framing the offer as an opportunity for Bob, highlighting its potential value to his business. I'm also emphasizing the discount to make the offer more appealing. 

**Why this approach:**

* **Maximizes profit:**  This price gives me a good profit ($200,000) while still being potentially attractive to Bob. 
* **Flexibility:** This leaves room for negotiation if Bob counters. I can potentially reach a higher price if he's interested.
* **Focus on value:**  The message focuses on the benefits for Bob, not just the price, which could increase his willingness to consider the offer.

**Remember:** This is just one potential strategy. The best approach depends on your specific circumstances and your assessment of Bob's willingness to negotiate."
