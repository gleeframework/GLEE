"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be a great asset to your business.  I'm offering it to you for $1,000,000. This is a significant discount from its true value to me.  I understand this is a substantial investment, but I'm confident it will generate strong returns for you.  Let me know if you'd like to discuss this further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

``` 

**Explanation:**

You are looking to pay no more than $800,000. Alice's offer of $1,000,000 exceeds your budget.  Therefore, you should reject her offer and buy from John for $800,000."
