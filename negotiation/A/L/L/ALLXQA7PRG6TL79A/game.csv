"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $9,000 is a bit higher than I was hoping for.  Would you be willing to go down to $8,500? I'm very interested in your product, and I think this price would be fair for both of us.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $8,500 is closer to where I'd like to be, but I'm still a little bit off.  How about we meet in the middle at $8,750?  That way we both get a good deal.",8750.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm still a bit higher than I'd like to be at $8,750.  I'm willing to go up to $8,250.  That's a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",8250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $8,250 is simply too low for me.  Let's split the difference again. I'm willing to come down to $8,500.  This is a fair price, and I think we can finally close this deal.",8500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $8,500. However, I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to go up to $8,100. This is my final offer, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement. Let's close this deal!",8100.0,Bob,6,
