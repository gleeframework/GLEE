"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that's worth a lot to you. I'm willing to let it go for $130. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($100) but lower than what I know the product is worth to Bob ($150). This gives room for negotiation.
* **Friendly Tone:** Using a friendly and engaging message sets a positive tone for the negotiation. 
* **Highlighting Value:** Mentioning the product's value to Bob helps him understand the price is fair."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you're willing to negotiate.  How about $110? It's still a good price for me, and it leaves some room for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Room for Improvement:**  Bob's offer is still lower than what I'd like to get.  I believe there's more room for negotiation. 
* **Strategic Counter-offer:** I'm aiming to maximize my profit and will use the next round to make a counter-offer closer to my desired price.
* **John's Offer:** While $100 is secure, I can likely do better with Bob, especially since he's already shown interest in the product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you're willing to negotiate. $110 is a bit low for me, but I'm open to a compromise. How about $120? That's still a great deal for you, and it gives us both a fair outcome. "", ""product_price"": 120}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a compromise by coming down from my initial offer but staying above Bob's offer.
* **Emphasize Value:** I'm again highlighting the value of the product to Bob to justify the price.
* **Positive Tone:**  Maintaining a positive and collaborative tone is important for keeping the negotiation moving forward."
