"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that's worth a lot to you. I'm willing to let it go for $130. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's worth trying to get a better price from Alice.  $130 is still a bit high for the value you place on the product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you're willing to negotiate.  How about $110? It's still a good price for me, and it leaves some room for both of us."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you're willing to negotiate. $110 is a bit low for me, but I'm open to a compromise. How about $120? That's still a great deal for you, and it gives us both a fair outcome.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
$120 is a good deal for me and still leaves some room for Alice to make a profit.  It's better than buying from John and keeps the negotiation going smoothly."
