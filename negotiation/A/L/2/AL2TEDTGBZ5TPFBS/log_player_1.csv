{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd love. I'm offering it to you for $90. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 90}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly above the minimum I'm willing to accept. This gives me some room to negotiate if Bob wants to counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but $90 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $70? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is below my minimum price of $80. I'm not willing to sell it for less, so I'll reject his offer and counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest but $70 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $85? It's still a great deal for a product worth $80."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your perspective, but $85 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $75? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer of $75 is still below my minimum price of $80.  I'm not willing to go lower, and I don't want to risk further negotiation.  It's better to secure the sale with John for $80."
