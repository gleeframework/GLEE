"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit too expensive. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $12,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. What do you think?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I'm eager to find the product a good home, $12,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. Could you do $17,000? That feels like a fair compromise.",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for the counteroffer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $17,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $14,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget. What do you think?",14000.0,Bob,4,
