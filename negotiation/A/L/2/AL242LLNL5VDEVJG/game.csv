"Alice, your price is a bit high for me. I'm interested in this product, but I can only go up to $8,500.  Let me know if that works for you.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $8,500 is too low for me to consider. Could you do $11,000?  I'm confident this product will exceed your expectations.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $11,000 is still a bit steep for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,500?  I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us.",9500.0,Bob,4,
