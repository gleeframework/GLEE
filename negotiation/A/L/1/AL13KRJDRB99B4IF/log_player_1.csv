"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 115}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $115. This is a good starting point because it's above my minimum price of $100, but still leaves room for negotiation.  It also gives Bob a good deal since he values the product at $120."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $110 is still a good deal for me, as it's above my minimum price of $100. It's also likely that if I reject his offer and make a counteroffer, we might end up in a stalemate, and I might be forced to sell to John for a lower price. Accepting his offer ensures I get a good price and avoid the risk of getting stuck in a negotiation loop."
