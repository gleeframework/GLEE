"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product at a price of $12,000. It's a great opportunity to get a high-quality item at a competitive price. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is $2,000 over your maximum budget. It's worth negotiating to try and get a better price. You can always buy from John for $10,000 if you can't reach a deal with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm really interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to pay $9,500 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $9,500 is a bit lower than I was hoping for. However, I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer the product to you for $11,000. This is a fair price considering the value it brings. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still higher than my maximum budget of $10,000. Although it's a step closer, there's still room for negotiation. I'll reject her offer and try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $11,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $10,500. This is the absolute maximum I can offer. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're willing to go up to $10,500, but I'm still not convinced that's a good price for this product. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $11,200, which is the lowest price I'm willing to accept. This is a fair price considering the value it brings. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's final offer is still $1,200 over my maximum budget.  While it's tempting to continue negotiating, I'm running the risk of getting stuck in a cycle of counteroffers.  John offers the product for my maximum budget, so it's the safest and most efficient choice to buy from him."
