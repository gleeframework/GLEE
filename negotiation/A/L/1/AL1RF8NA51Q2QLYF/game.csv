"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm really interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to pay $9,500 for it. Let me know what you think.",9500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $9,500 is a bit lower than I was hoping for. However, I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer the product to you for $11,000. This is a fair price considering the value it brings. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $11,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $10,500. This is the absolute maximum I can offer. What do you say?",10500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're willing to go up to $10,500, but I'm still not convinced that's a good price for this product. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $11,200, which is the lowest price I'm willing to accept. This is a fair price considering the value it brings. What do you think?",11200.0,Alice,5,
