Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the product for $14,000. I believe this product would be highly beneficial to you, even at a slightly lower price than its absolute value to me. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I could sell the product to John for $15,000, there's a chance to get a higher price from Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product for $14,000 creates a win-win situation. Bob gets a $2,000 discount from the product's worth to him, and I earn $1,000 more than selling it to John. 
* **Positive Framing:** The message highlights the potential benefit to Bob while subtly acknowledging the lower price is a concession on my part. 
 
This approach aims to secure a quick and profitable sale with Bob."
