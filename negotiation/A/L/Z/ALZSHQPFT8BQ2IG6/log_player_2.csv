Please let me know if you would like to proceed with this offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer

While $14,000 is less than your maximum budget, there's a chance Alice might be willing to lower the price further. Rejecting her initial offer opens the door for negotiation. You can always fall back on buying from John for $15,000 if needed."
