"I'd like to offer you the product for $15,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you is $8,000, and I'm willing to negotiate if you're interested.",15000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but $15,000 is way above my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product, which is still a fair price considering the value to me. Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $15,000 is a bit steep, but $8,500 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $12,500. This is a fair price considering the value to you is $8,000, and it's a 50% profit for me.",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $12,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $9,500. This would be a fair compromise, allowing you a profit while still staying within my budget. What do you think?",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go as low as $9,500, but I'm willing to meet you halfway between $12,500 and $9,500. Let's try $11,000. This is a compromise that still allows me to make a profit, but also shows that I'm willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial price.",11000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $11,000 is still a bit higher than I can afford. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product. This would be a good compromise for both of us - a fair profit for you and a price within my budget.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",10000.0,Bob,6,
