"Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective on the value, but $900,000 is significantly below what I can accept.  This product has considerable potential, and I'm confident it can generate substantial returns for you. Would you be willing to consider a price closer to $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your confidence in the product's potential, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1,050,000. I believe this is a fair price that balances the product's value with my budget.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
