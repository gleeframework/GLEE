Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 14000} 
```

This offer leaves some room for negotiation, as Bob values the product at $15,000, but also ensures I get a good price, significantly above my minimum of $10,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

$12,000 is still too low for me, especially given that I know Bob is willing to pay more. I'll counter with a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000} 
```

I'm willing to come down a little bit from my initial offer, but I'm still holding firm on a price that's closer to my valuation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

```

While I'd prefer a higher price, $12,500 is a decent offer and closer to my desired price than John's offer. This eliminates the risk of further negotiation and ensures a sale."
