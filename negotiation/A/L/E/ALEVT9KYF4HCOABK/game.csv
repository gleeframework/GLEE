"Alice, while I appreciate your offer,  $1750000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1100000 for the product, which I believe is a fair price considering its value to me.  Let's see if we can work something out.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $1100000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need something closer to my original offer.  How about $1600000? This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident it still represents great value for you.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1600000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1200000,  which is a significant increase from my previous offer.  This shows my commitment to making this deal work.  Let's find common ground.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
