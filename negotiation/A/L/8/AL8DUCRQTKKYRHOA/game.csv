"Bob, I appreciate your offer but it's not quite where I need to be. I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000 for the product. This reflects its value and leaves room for both of us to benefit from the deal. What do you say?",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but it's still a bit too high for me. I can offer $950,000. That's a significant increase from my previous offer and would be a fair deal for both of us.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to find a good deal, but $950,000 is still below my minimum.  How about we meet in the middle? I'm willing to offer the product for $1,100,000. This gives you a great price and lets me secure a fair return.  Let's close this deal!",1100000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, you're getting closer! I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,025,000. That's a very strong offer and shows I'm serious about buying.  Let's make this work!",1025000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I appreciate you increasing your offer, but I'm still not there yet.  I'm willing to go down to $1,075,000 for the product. This is a fair compromise, and it reflects the true value of what I'm offering.  Let's finalize this deal!",1075000.0,Alice,7,
