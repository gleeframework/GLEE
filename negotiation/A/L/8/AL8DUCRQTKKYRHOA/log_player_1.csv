Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $800,000 for the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $800,000 is a significant amount, it's far below my minimum acceptable value of $1,500,000.  I'll try to negotiate a better price with Bob in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but it's still a bit too high for me. I can offer $950,000. That's a significant increase from my previous offer and would be a fair deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to find a good deal, but $950,000 is still below my minimum.  How about we meet in the middle? I'm willing to offer the product for $1,100,000.
