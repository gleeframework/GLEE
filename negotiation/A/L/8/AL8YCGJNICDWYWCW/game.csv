"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you my product for $1100000. This is a significant discount from its true value to me, but I believe it's a fair price that allows us both to benefit from this transaction. Let me know your thoughts!",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1000000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1000000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1050000?  This price still allows you a good margin for profit while also being closer to my valuation. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above my target. I'm willing to make a serious offer, and I think $980000 is a fair price for the product. I'm hoping we can meet on this price.",980000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, while I appreciate your persistence, $980000 is still a bit below my minimum. I'm willing to come down a little further, but I need to stay above $1000000. How about $1025000? This is a compromise that allows both of us to walk away with a positive outcome. Let me know your thoughts.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to find a compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget with your latest offer. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget. I'm thinking of $1005000, which is the midpoint between your last offer and my target price. I hope we can meet on this price.",1005000.0,Bob,6,
