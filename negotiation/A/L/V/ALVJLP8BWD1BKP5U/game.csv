"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to buy this valuable product from me. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $800,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's worth to you.",800000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $800,000 is a bit too high for me. Could you do $500,000?",500000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $800,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to lower the price to $700,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to you.",700000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice.  How about we meet in the middle at $600,000? That would work for me.",600000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $600,000 is a good compromise, but I'm still not willing to give up too much. I'm willing to go a bit lower and offer it to you for $650,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",650000.0,Alice,5,
