"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a fantastic deal, and I'm confident you'll find it highly valuable. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $1,400,000 is a better deal than John's $1,200,000, Bob can potentially get a better price by negotiating with Alice. There's still room for a counteroffer to get the price closer to Bob's maximum value of $1,200,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product. Let's meet in the middle and make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 1250000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1,250,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little further to $1,350,000. This reflects the significant value you'll gain from the product, and it's a fair compromise. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,350,000 is within Bob's budget and is a better deal than buying from John for $1,200,000.  While Bob could continue negotiating, there's a risk that Alice will walk away, and he'll be forced to buy from John.  Accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product at a reasonable price."
