"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I think this product is great, $16,500 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $14,000 for it.  What do you think?",14000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate you're interested in the product.  $14,000 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $15,500.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  What do you say?",15500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. $15,500 is still a little higher than I'd like to go. I'm willing to offer $15,250, which is right in the middle of our two offers. If this is acceptable, I'm ready to purchase now.",15250.0,Bob,4,
