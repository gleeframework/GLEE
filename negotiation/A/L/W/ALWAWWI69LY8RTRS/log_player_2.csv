"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic opportunity to purchase [product name].  Given its value and potential, I believe a price of $1,350,000 is fair. This is a limited-time offer, as I do have other interested parties. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While the offer of $1,350,000 is more than Alice values the product for, it's significantly less than your maximum budget of $1,500,000 and the price John is offering. Accepting this offer saves you $150,000."
