"Hello Bob, thank you for your interest in my product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm offering it to you for $2,300,000. I believe this price reflects the significant return on investment you'll see.",2300000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your time and consideration, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,800,000. I believe that's a fair price given the market value of similar products. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget.",1800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, Bob, and I appreciate you meeting me halfway. Considering the unique features and long-term value this product offers, I propose a price of $2,100,000. This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges the value you're gaining.",2100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still not convinced that $2,100,000 is a fair price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to be more aggressive this time. I'm thinking $1,600,000 is a more reasonable price for a product that's worth $1,500,000 to you. I'm willing to make a deal, but I need a better price.",1600000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your directness. It seems we both see the value in this product, even if our valuations differ.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,900,000? This recognizes the value while finding a compromise.",1900000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still not convinced that $1,900,000 is the right price. I'm willing to compromise, but I think $1,700,000 is a more reasonable price for the product. I'm willing to make a deal, but I need a bit more room to maneuver. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price.",1700000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, we're getting close, but I need you to understand the value this product represents. My final offer is $1,850,000. This is a firm price, and I believe it's more than fair considering the long-term benefits you'll gain.",1850000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm starting to feel like we're not going to meet in the middle. I'm willing to make one more serious offer, and that's $1,600,000. This is my final counteroffer. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",1600000.0,Bob,8,
