{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $11,000. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this is a fair price that reflects its worth."", 
""product_price"": 11000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Aiming for a price close to Bob's perceived value ($12,000) maximizes potential profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting high allows room for Bob to negotiate down, potentially still landing within a very profitable range.
* **Secure the Higher Sale:**  While John offers a guaranteed $8,000, there's a chance Bob will accept a price significantly higher."
