"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $110. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Alice's initial offer of $110 is above Bob's maximum budget of $80.  It's best to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product but $110 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay.  I'd be happy to pay $80 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 80}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Start with a strong offer:**  Bob goes straight for his maximum price, demonstrating his commitment to getting a good deal. 
* **Be polite and respectful:** A friendly tone makes it more likely Alice will consider the offer.
* **Set the expectation:** Bob is clear that this is his highest offer, putting the ball in Alice's court."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $80 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to come down to $95.  This is still a fair price for the value you'll get from this product.  Let's try to make this work! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down in price, $95 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $80. He has already shown his willingness to pay $80, so it makes sense to reject this offer and try to negotiate further. There's still room for Alice to come down a bit more, and Bob can always buy from John if he needs to."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for being flexible.  $95 is closer, but I'm still only able to go up to $85.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it will let me get the product I need. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 85} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incrementally increase the offer:** Bob is showing he's serious about negotiating and is willing to meet Alice halfway. 
* **Focus on fairness:**  Highlighting that $85 is a fair price for both of them makes it more appealing to Alice.
* **Reinforce the need:** Reminding Alice that this will allow Bob to get the product he needs emphasizes his commitment to the deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $85 simply doesn't work for me.  I'm firm on my price of $90.  This is still a great value for the product, and it's the best I can do.  Let's close this deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still above budget:**  While Alice has lowered her price again, $90 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $80. 
* **Room for negotiation:**  Alice has shown flexibility, so there's still potential to negotiate further.  Bob can try to push for a lower price, knowing he can always buy from John if necessary. 
* **Staying firm:**  Rejecting this offer shows Alice that Bob is serious about his price point and is willing to walk away if needed."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  However, $90 is still a bit outside my budget.  I can offer $87, which is a fair price for both of us.  It's the best I can do, and it would allow me to get the product I need.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 87} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small increment:**  Bob is offering a small increase from his previous offer, showing he's serious about closing the deal but not conceding too much.
* **Focus on fairness:**  He emphasizes that $87 is fair for both of them, appealing to Alice's sense of reason.
* **Reiterate the need:**  He reminds Alice that this price allows him to get the product, making it a win-win situation."
