"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $110. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!",110.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product but $110 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay.  I'd be happy to pay $80 for it. Let me know what you think.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $80 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to come down to $95.  This is still a fair price for the value you'll get from this product.  Let's try to make this work!",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for being flexible.  $95 is closer, but I'm still only able to go up to $85.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it will let me get the product I need. What do you say?",85.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $85 simply doesn't work for me.  I'm firm on my price of $90.  This is still a great value for the product, and it's the best I can do.  Let's close this deal!",90.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  However, $90 is still a bit outside my budget.  I can offer $87, which is a fair price for both of us.  It's the best I can do, and it would allow me to get the product I need.  What do you think?",87.0,Bob,6,
