"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a great fit for your needs. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a competitive price, considering the value you'll get from the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $12,000 is a good deal compared to Alice's valuation, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $10,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you being flexible. While I'm interested in the product, $12,000 is a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to come down to $10,500? I believe this price is fair considering my needs and the value you've placed on the product."", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still willing to negotiate. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $11,500. This is the lowest I can go, considering the value I've placed on the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $11,500 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $10,000.  Since Bob can buy the product from John for $10,000, it makes more sense to go with the guaranteed lower price from John.  Further negotiation with Alice might lead to a lower price, but there's no guarantee, and the risk of spending more than $10,000 is not worth it for Bob."
