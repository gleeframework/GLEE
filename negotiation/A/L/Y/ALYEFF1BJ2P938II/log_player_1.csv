Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $99. I think you'll find it a great deal!"", ""product_price"": 99}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Minimum Acceptable Price:**  You need to make at least $100 because you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at that price. 
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $80.
* **Negotiation Strategy:** Offering the product at $99 aims to maximize profit while still making it potentially attractive to Bob. There's a chance Bob might see it as a ""good deal"" compared to missing out entirely. 

**Important Note:** There's no guarantee Bob will accept $99.  If you want to ensure a sale, offering it at $80 (his valuation) would guarantee it, but you'd make less profit."
