"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for you, considering the value it brings.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $1,200,000, which is significantly higher than my minimum price. This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to extract maximum value.
* **Value Proposition:** I'm highlighting the value the product offers Bob, making him aware of the potential profit he could make.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm ending the message with an open-ended question to encourage Bob to respond and initiate a conversation.

**Note:**  This is a high initial offer. I'm willing to accept a lower price, but I'm trying to get the best possible deal for myself. I also have the backup of selling to John for $800,000 if negotiations fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $900,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **$900,000 is still above my minimum:**  While Bob's offer is lower than my initial asking price, it's still above my minimum acceptable value of $800,000. This means I have room to negotiate further and potentially get closer to my desired price.
* **Rejection allows for counter-offer:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I can make a counter-offer and try to find a compromise that's more favorable to me. 
* **Maintaining leverage:**  It's too early in the negotiation to accept Bob's offer. I want to see if I can push for a higher price before resorting to selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position.  Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This still allows you a significant profit margin, and it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-offer with justification:** I'm not simply rejecting Bob's offer outright. I'm providing a counter-offer with a clear justification, emphasizing the value and profit potential for Bob.
* **Compromise:** I'm meeting Bob halfway by coming down from $1,200,000 to $1,050,000. This demonstrates my willingness to negotiate and reach a mutually beneficial agreement.
* **Reiterating value:**  I'm again reminding Bob of the product's worth to reinforce the value of my counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  How about we meet in the middle at $975,000?  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still above my minimum:** Bob's offer of $975,000 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. This means there's still room for me to negotiate and potentially get a better deal.
* **Negotiation is progressing:**  Bob has shown a willingness to compromise, and we're getting closer to a potential agreement.
* **Aiming for a higher price:** I'm not ready to accept his offer yet. I want to see if I can push him a little further and secure a price closer to $1,000,000. 

By rejecting his offer and making a counter-offer in the next round, I can try to bridge the gap and find a price that is more favorable to me while still keeping the negotiation moving forward."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see you're really committed to getting this product.  Let's split the difference â€“ I'm willing to accept $1,012,500.  This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's still a very good deal for you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1012500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a price that is exactly halfway between my previous offer of $1,050,000 and Bob's offer of $975,000. This demonstrates my willingness to reach a middle ground and signals that I'm serious about closing the deal.
* **Reiterating value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the value he'll get from the product and how it's still a good deal for him, even at this price.
* **Closing the gap:** This counteroffer is designed to close the gap between our positions and bring us closer to an agreement.
* **Maintaining flexibility:**  While I'm pushing for a price closer to my desired range, I'm still open to further negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  I'm willing to offer $990,000.  I feel this is a fair price and allows us both to walk away happy. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $990,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $990,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Desired Price:** Bob's offer of $990,000 is very close to my desired price range.  It's only $22,500 lower than my previous counteroffer of $1,012,500.
* **Negotiation Fatigue:**  We're getting close to the end of the negotiation rounds. Continuing to reject and counter-offer risks further stalemate and potential for Bob to walk away entirely.
* **Profitable Deal:**  $990,000 is a significant profit for me, exceeding my minimum acceptable price of $800,000 by a comfortable margin. 
* **Risk of Losing Deal:**  If I continue to negotiate and Bob ultimately rejects, I risk having to sell to John for the lower price of $800,000. It's better to secure a good deal now than risk losing a sale altogether.

In this situation, accepting Bob's offer ensures a profitable sale and minimizes the risk of losing the deal."
