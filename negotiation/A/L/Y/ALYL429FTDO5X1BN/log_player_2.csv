"Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $20,000 is far more than his maximum price, and he has a guaranteed alternative with John.  It makes sense to try to negotiate a lower price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8000}
``` 

Bob is going to start by offering a price significantly lower than Alice's initial price. This sets a lower bar for negotiation and shows Alice that Bob is serious about getting a good deal.  Since Bob is willing to pay $10,000 for the product, offering $8,000 is a reasonable starting point."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $18,000 is closer to his maximum price, it's still higher than what he's willing to pay. There's still room for negotiation, and he can try to get a better price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

Bob is going to increase his offer slightly to $9,500. This is a compromise between his previous offer and Alice's latest offer, showing that he's willing to meet her halfway. It's also a significant discount from Alice's latest price and still below his maximum price.  This counteroffer will hopefully be enough to tempt Alice into accepting, but still leaves some room for negotiation if she rejects it."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $16,500 is getting closer to his maximum price, it's still higher than he wants to pay. He's already shown a willingness to negotiate and can likely get a lower price from Alice by continuing the back and forth.  It's worth risking another round of counteroffers to see if he can reach a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000} 
```

Bob is going to increase his offer again, but only slightly to $11,000. This is still below his maximum price and shows Alice that he is serious about buying the product but is also not willing to pay her asking price. This is a calculated risk: if Alice rejects, he can always buy from John. If Alice accepts, he saves a significant amount of money."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

Bob should choose to buy from John.  Alice's offer of $17,000 is still too high, and with each round of negotiation, the price seems to be stuck in the $16,000 - $18,000 range.  It's clear that Alice is unwilling to budge much further, and Bob doesn't want to risk going back and forth any longer. John is offering a price that is within Bob's budget, and he can be certain of purchasing the product without any more negotiations."
