"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that you might be interested in.  I'm asking for $110 for it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($100) to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Being Friendly:** A friendly message can help establish a rapport and make Bob more receptive to the offer.
* **Value Proposition:**  While I haven't explicitly stated the value of the product to Bob, the message hints at its desirability. 

I'm aiming to see if Bob is willing to pay a price closer to my desired value.  If he rejects, I'll adjust my strategy in the subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $110 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay.  How about $85?  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** $85 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $100. 
* **Negotiation is Possible:** While Bob's offer is low, it shows he's interested. This means there's room for negotiation, and I can try to get closer to my desired price.
* **Opportunity to Increase Value:**  By rejecting the offer, I can counter with a higher price and potentially extract more value from the deal. 

**Next Step:** I will counter Bob's offer with a price closer to my minimum acceptable price, aiming to reach a mutually agreeable outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer, but I can't go as low as $85.  How about we split the difference at $95?  That's still a good deal for you, and it gets us closer to a deal."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a compromise by meeting Bob halfway, which can make him feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **Maintaining Value:**  $95 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $100, but it shows flexibility.
* **Reinforcing Value:** I emphasize that $95 is still a good deal for Bob, reminding him of the product's worth.

I'm hoping this counteroffer will lead to a successful agreement. If Bob rejects again, I will adjust my strategy based on his willingness to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $95 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we settle at $90?  That's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Target:** $90 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $100. 
* **Limited Rounds:** With only 6 rounds remaining, it's becoming increasingly risky to keep rejecting offers.
* **Risk of Selling to John:** If I keep rejecting Bob's offers, I risk losing the deal and having to sell to John for a lower price ($100).  

While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, accepting Bob's offer at $90 ensures a sale and minimizes the risk of losing out completely."
