"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm really interested in the product, but $115 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Would you be willing to consider $105? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",105.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $105 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $110. This gives you a good deal and still allows me to get a fair price for my product. Let me know what you think.",110.0,Alice,3,
