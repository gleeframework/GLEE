"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $115. I think this is a fair price considering its value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

You can likely get a better price than $115, so it's worth trying to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm really interested in the product, but $115 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Would you be willing to consider $105? I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $105 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $110. This gives you a good deal and still allows me to get a fair price for my product. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Alice has come down to $110, which is within your budget and still a good deal. There's no guarantee you'll get a lower price, and you risk losing the product altogether if you continue to negotiate."
