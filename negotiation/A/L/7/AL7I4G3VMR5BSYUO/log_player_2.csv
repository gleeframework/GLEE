Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:** Alice's offer is just slightly above my previous counteroffer. It's a good compromise, and it's much better than buying from John. It's likely that continuing to negotiate will just increase the price, so it's a good time to accept this offer."
