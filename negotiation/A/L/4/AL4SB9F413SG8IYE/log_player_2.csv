"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think you'll really like it. Would you like to buy it from me for $140? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  You are willing to pay up to $150, but Alice is asking for $140. 
* **There's room for negotiation.** You can likely get a better price by making a counteroffer. 
* **It's early in the negotiation.** You have 10 rounds to close a deal, so there's no need to rush into accepting the first offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $140 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  How about $130?  I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 130}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a fair price, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we try $137.50? I think that's a good compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $137.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $137.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still a bit high.** You are looking to save as much money as possible, and $137.50 is still above your target of $130.
* **There's still room for negotiation.** Alice is showing flexibility by lowering her price.  You can likely get even closer to your target price by making another counteroffer. 
* **You have time.** You still have 7 rounds left, so there's no need to settle for a price that's not ideal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  I'm still a bit hesitant at $137.50.  Would you be willing to come down to $135?  I'm confident this is a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 135}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting close to my minimum price, Bob. I'm willing to go down to $138, but that's as low as I can go. It's a great product, and I think it's worth more than that. Can you meet me at $138? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $138. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $138
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is close to your target price.** She's dropped her price to $138, which is only $3 above your desired $135.
* **You have limited rounds left.**  You've already used 4 rounds, and you only have 6 left before you're forced to buy from John.
* **The risk of going to John is high.** Buying from John would cost you $150, which is more than Alice's current offer. 
* **There's a chance Alice will reject your next offer.** This could lead to further negotiation rounds, potentially leaving you with less time and a worse deal.

It's strategically better to accept Alice's offer and secure the product at a price that's only slightly higher than your target. You've achieved a decent outcome while minimizing your risk."
