"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $90 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $95. This is a great deal for you, as you know the product is worth more than that to you.  What do you say?",95.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $85 is just too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $90. This is still a good deal for you, as it's lower than my initial price. Let's close this deal!",90.0,Alice,5,
