"Alice, thanks for the offer. However, that price is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to offer $800,000 for the product.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but it's unfortunately too low.  I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000 to meet you halfway. This is still a significant discount from my original offer, and it reflects the value I believe the product holds. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand the value of the product, but I have a budget in mind. I'm willing to increase my offer to $950,000. Let me know if that works for you.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $950,000 is still too low. Let's try to find a middle ground. I'm willing to go down to $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and my initial offer.  I hope we can reach an agreement in this round.",1100000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I understand we're getting close, but $1,025,000 is still a bit below what I'm aiming for.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to go down to $1,062,500.  This would be a good deal for both of us, and hopefully, we can finally reach an agreement.",1062500.0,Alice,7,
