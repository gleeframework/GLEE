""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be a valuable asset to you. I'm asking for $11,500. Let me know if you're interested."", 
""product_price"": 11500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to Bob's $12,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting a bit high allows room for Bob to negotiate down, potentially still landing above Alice's minimum.
* **Avoid Appearing Desperate:** Offering it at $10,000 (her minimum) might make Bob think it's worth less. 

By starting at $11,500, Alice is in a strong position to potentially earn a significant profit while still having John as a backup buyer."
