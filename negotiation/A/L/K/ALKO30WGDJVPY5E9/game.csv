"Alice, your offer is a bit high for me. I'm interested in your product but I'm only willing to pay $900,000 for it. This is a fair price, considering its value to me. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest in my product. While $900,000 is a good starting point, I'm still looking for a price closer to my initial offer. Let's compromise at $1,050,000. This price reflects the value of the product and leaves room for both of us to benefit from this deal.  I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
