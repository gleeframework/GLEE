"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it's worth every penny.",9000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested in the product, but $9000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  Would you be willing to come down to $7500?  That's still a good price for you, and it fits within my budget.",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $7500. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $8250. It's a compromise that still benefits both of us, and I think you'll find it's a fair price.",8250.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  $8250 is closer, but I'm still a bit over budget.  How about $8000?  I'm confident that's a fair price for both of us, and it would allow me to move forward with the purchase.",8000.0,Bob,4,
