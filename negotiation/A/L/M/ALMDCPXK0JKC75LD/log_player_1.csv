Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 120}
```

I'm starting with a price of $120, hoping to get a good starting point. If Bob rejects, I can always adjust based on his counteroffer or move on to John for a guaranteed $100."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$90 is below my minimum, so I'm rejecting Bob's offer. I'll try to get a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

I'm going to counter with $105. This is still above my minimum of $100, but it shows I'm willing to compromise a bit. Hopefully, Bob will see this as a reasonable offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum. While I'm tempted to keep negotiating,  I'm concerned the price might not go up much further. It's better to take the guaranteed $100 from John."
