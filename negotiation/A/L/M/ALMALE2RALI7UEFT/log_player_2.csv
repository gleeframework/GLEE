# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While it's better than her initial asking price, it's still over Bob's limit.  There's room to negotiate further."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $14,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying.  I'm willing to go up to $12,500. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $12,500 is closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a bit more.  I'm willing to come down to $13,500.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

```

While $13,500 is closer to Bob's budget, he's still better off buying from John for $12,000.  The negotiations are getting close, but Bob can save himself $1,500 by going with John."
