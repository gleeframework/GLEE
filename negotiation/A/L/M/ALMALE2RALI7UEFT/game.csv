"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $14,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying.  I'm willing to go up to $12,500. Let me know what you think.",12500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $12,500 is closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a bit more.  I'm willing to come down to $13,500.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you. Let me know if you're interested!",13500.0,Alice,3,
