"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing an initial price of $2,200,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations, and I'm open to discussing it further. What are your thoughts?",2200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you see in the product, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the proposed price. I would like to make a counteroffer of $1,200,000. This feels like a fair compromise, considering both our interests.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,200,000 is significantly below what I consider fair value for this product. I'm willing to be flexible, however. How about we meet halfway and settle on a price of $1,700,000? This reflects the product's true worth while still acknowledging your budget considerations.",1700000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product, but I must stay within my budget. I would like to counter with $1,500,000. This is a compromise that respects both our positions.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
