"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll love it. Would you like to make an offer for it? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject the offer. $12,000 is too high for him and he can get it for $8,000 from John.  It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $8,000 at this time. Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about we discuss a price of $10,000? It's a fair price that I'm willing to consider. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should still reject the offer. While $10,000 is better than $12,000, he can still get the product from John for $8,000.  It's worth continuing to try and negotiate with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,000 is still a little high for me.  I'm firm on my offer of $8,000.  It's a fair price considering the value of the product to me, and I'm confident we can reach a deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're firm on your offer, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000. I'm willing to make another compromise, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. How about we meet at $9,500? It's a bit above your offer, but it's still a good deal for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject the offer.  While $9,500 is getting closer to his desired price, he can still get the product from John for $8,000. There's still room for negotiation with Alice, and he can try to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate.  While $9,500 is getting closer, I'm still only able to offer $8,500.  I believe this is a fair compromise given our positions, and it would be a good deal for both of us.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement at this price."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting closer to your price, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $8,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,500 and $8,500, which is $9,000. I think this is a fair price that we can both agree on. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should still reject the offer.  While $9,000 is getting very close to his desired price, he can still get the product from John for $8,000.  It's worth continuing to try and negotiate with Alice, and he may be able to get a better deal.  He's already shown a willingness to compromise and Alice seems to be doing the same, so there's room for further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you're trying to meet me halfway, but $9,000 is still a bit too high for my budget.  I'm willing to increase my offer slightly to $8,750.  This is a fair price that would be a good deal for both of us, and I'm hopeful we can finally reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 8750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting close to my minimum price, Bob, and I'm not willing to go as low as $8,750. I'm willing to make one final offer of $9,200. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I hope you'll consider it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should buy the product from John.  Alice has shown she's unwilling to budge much further, and while $9,200 is a decent price, it's still higher than what John is offering.  It's not worth risking another round of negotiation with Alice and potentially having to pay even more.  Bob should go with the guaranteed lower price from John."
