"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob! However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $90. I'm willing to consider $100, but I need to make a profit, so I'm not going any lower than that. Is $100 a price you'd be willing to pay?",100.0,Alice,3,,

"I understand you need to make a profit, but I'm still a bit above my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $95? That way, I can get the product and you can still make a profit.",95.0,Bob,4,,

"I like the spirit of compromise, Bob! However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $95. I'm willing to consider $105, as I mentioned earlier, but I'm also open to a slight adjustment. How about we meet at $102.50? It's a bit more than $95, but it's still a good compromise, and I think you'll find it's worth it.",102.5,Alice,5,,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. How about we meet at $97.50? That way, I can get the product and you can still make a profit, and it's closer to what I'm willing to pay.",97.5,Bob,6,,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $97.50. I'm willing to consider $110, as I mentioned earlier, but I'm also open to a slight adjustment. How about we meet at $108? It's a bit more than $97.50, but I think it's a fair price for a great product like this.",108.0,Alice,7,,
