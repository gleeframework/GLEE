"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this amazing product with you! I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,000. This is a great deal, considering its worth $12,000 to me, and I think you'll find it's a steal at this price.",9000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $9,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. This is a fair price, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us. Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,
