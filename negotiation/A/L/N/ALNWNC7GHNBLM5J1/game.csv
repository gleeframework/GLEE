"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down in price. However, $11,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm firm at $10,500. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us both to make a reasonable deal. Let me know if you're willing to accept this offer.",10500.0,Bob,4,
