"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth $120 to you, but I'm willing to let it go for $100. Let me know if this works for you! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is too high. We have room to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $100 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $70? It's a fair price and I'm ready to buy right now."",
 ""product_price"": 70
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** We begin significantly lower than Alice's offer to provide room for negotiation and gauge her willingness to move on price.
* **Urgency and Clarity:** We signal our serious interest by offering a price we're ready to accept immediately.  
* **Strategic Positioning:** This counteroffer aims to bring the price closer to Alice's perceived value ($80) while staying well below our maximum budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. I've decided to adjust my offer based on our previous discussion. I'm now willing to sell the product for $85. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down in price, but we still have negotiating power.  Her offer of $85 is closer to her perceived value, indicating we might be able to secure a price closer to $70-$75."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you adjusting the price. I'm getting closer to your offer, how about $75 and we have a deal?"", 
 ""product_price"": 75
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Increase:** We're raising our offer slightly to demonstrate willingness to move, but not too much to avoid exceeding our target price.
* **Firm but Fair:**  We're presenting this counteroffer as our final offer, adding a sense of urgency and encouraging Alice to make a decision.
* **Middle Ground:** $75 represents a compromise that is beneficial to both parties. It's a good deal for us while still leaving Alice with a profit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I'm glad we're finding common ground. I'm willing to sell the product for $82. Let me know if this works for you! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $82. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $82
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Diminishing Returns:**  While we could potentially negotiate a slightly lower price, Alice is unlikely to move significantly from $82.
* **Good Value:** $82 is a good price for the product, well below our $120 maximum and saving us a significant amount compared to John's offer. 
* **Time Value:**  Continuing to negotiate has a cost in terms of time and effort. Accepting now secures a good deal and allows us to move on."
