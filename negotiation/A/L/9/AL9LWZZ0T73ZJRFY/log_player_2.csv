You have three options:

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand where you're coming from, but I can't go as low as $95.  My final offer is $120.  This is a really good deal for this product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120.

**Reasoning:** While Alice is coming down in price, it's unlikely she'll go below $100.  At this point, John's offer is the best deal and guarantees I stay within my budget."
