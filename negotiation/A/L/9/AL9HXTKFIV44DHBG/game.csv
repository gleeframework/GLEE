"Bob, I appreciate your interest!  While $10,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to come down a bit more.  How about $12,000?  This is a great deal for a product worth much more, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it.",12000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you.  $9,500 is still a bit low for me, but to show my willingness to close this deal, I'll come down to $11,000.  It's a fair price for a high-quality product.  Let me know if you're interested.",11000.0,Alice,5,
