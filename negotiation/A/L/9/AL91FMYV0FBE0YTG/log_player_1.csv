"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product with you.  Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,000,000."",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to begin negotiations with a price higher than your desired outcome. This allows room for negotiation and signals the product's value to you.
* **Above Bob's Value:** The initial price is significantly above Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000). This allows you to gauge Bob's interest and potentially secure a deal closer to your minimum acceptable price.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** By starting high, you demonstrate a willingness to negotiate, which can encourage Bob to engage in the process.

This strategy aims to maximize your potential profit while keeping the door open for a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your enthusiasm, $2,000,000 is significantly above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000, which is still a fair price for the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is exactly his perceived value, which was expected. Accepting this offer would leave a significant amount of money on the table. We have room to negotiate and try to get closer to our desired outcome.  Selling to John right now would be a safe option, but there's still potential to secure a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective. While $2,000,000 represents the premium value of this product, I'm open to finding a solution that works for both of us. I'm willing to come down to $1,800,000.  This price reflects the unique benefits and potential this product offers."",
""product_price"": 1800000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** While we're not accepting Bob's offer, it's important to show some flexibility.  Coming down by $200,000 demonstrates a willingness to negotiate.
* **Still Above Bob's Value:** The new price is still significantly above Bob's stated value, leaving room for further negotiation.
* **Reiterating Value:** The message emphasizes the product's benefits and potential, subtly justifying the higher price point.

This counteroffer aims to keep the negotiation moving while still aiming for a price that's closer to your minimum acceptable amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,800,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm sticking to my offer of $1,200,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product to me. I'm hoping we can reach a deal at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is holding firm at his initial offer, indicating he might be less flexible than hoped. However, we still have time and room to negotiate before considering John's offer. Accepting $1,200,000 now would be leaving potential profit on the table. A counteroffer that strategically moves closer to a potential compromise is the best way to proceed."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I respect your position, but I believe we can find a middle ground that benefits both of us.  To move this forward, I'm willing to offer the product for $1,600,000. This is a significant adjustment on my end, demonstrating my commitment to reaching a deal."",
""product_price"": 1600000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Movement:** This counteroffer represents a larger price reduction ($200,000), signaling  seriousness about reaching an agreement. 
* **Midpoint Approach:**  The price is now halfway between your initial offer and Bob's offer. This can be a psychologically persuasive tactic, suggesting fairness.
* **Deadline Awareness:**  We're approaching the halfway point of the negotiation rounds. While we have time, a sense of urgency is subtly implied to encourage a response from Bob.

This offer aims to strike a balance between securing a favorable price and keeping the negotiation moving towards a successful conclusion."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your continued efforts to find a solution, but $1,600,000 is still beyond my budget.  My offer remains at $1,200,000. This is a fair price, and I'm confident it's a good deal for both of us.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Inflexibility:** Bob has not budged from his initial offer, indicating he's unlikely to move significantly higher. 
* **Opportunity Cost:** Continuing to negotiate with Bob risks missing out on a guaranteed sale to John at $1,500,000. 
* **Minimizing Risk:** While there's a chance Bob could eventually agree to a higher price, selling to John guarantees a profit and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation.

At this point, the certainty of John's offer outweighs the potential, but uncertain, upside of continuing with Bob."
