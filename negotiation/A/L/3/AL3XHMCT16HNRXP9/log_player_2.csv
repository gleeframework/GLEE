Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $900,000 is a bit too low for me to consider, I'm open to finding a middle ground. How about we settle at $1,025,000? This reflects a significant discount from my initial offer and recognizes the value this product brings.

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still higher than your ideal price point. You should reject her offer and try to negotiate a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position and I'm keen on making this work.  Let's try this - I'm willing to come down to $980,000. This is my final offer, as it represents a significant compromise on my end and still reflects the true value of the product.  What do you say?

Alice has come down significantly from her original price, and you're only $80,000 away from your maximum budget. It's worth accepting this offer, as you're unlikely to get a lower price from Alice."
