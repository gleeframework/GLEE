"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe you would find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $130. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $130 is a good deal compared to John's $150, there's still room for negotiation.  You can likely get the price lower by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $130 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. How about $110? I'm really hoping to get a good deal on this."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your position, but I can't go as low as $110. Would you consider $120? It's a fair price considering the value you'll be getting. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down from $130 to $120. This is a good deal, considering your limit is $150 and John is selling it for that price.  It's worth accepting the offer to save $30."
