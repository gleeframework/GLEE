,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1050000. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but I think $950000 is a more reasonable price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I don't think I can go any higher than that.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a fair price, Bob. However, considering the product's value to you is $1200000, I think $1050000 is still a reasonable offer. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. Let's try $1025000.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above $1000000. I'm willing to pay $975000 for the product. This is my final offer.",975000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to go below $1050000. I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal, but I need to make sure I get a good price. Let's try $1025000 again, and I'll throw in some extras to sweeten the deal.",1025000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm not interested in the extras, and I'm still not willing to pay $1025000. I'll make a final offer of $980000, and that's as high as I'm willing to go. If you're not willing to accept this price, I'll have to consider buying from John.",980000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to get a good deal, Bob, but I'm starting to think you're not taking this product seriously. I've been willing to work with you, but I need to make a profit. I'll make one last offer: $1020000, and that's as low as I'm willing to go. If you're not interested, I'll have to consider other options.",1020000.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
I'm not interested in the product at $1020000. I think it's time to walk away. I'm going to consider buying the product from John for $1200000. Good luck finding another buyer.,0.0,Bob,10,
