Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $22,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm interested in this product, but I can only offer $8,000 at this time. Let's see if we can find some common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 5

{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but the gap between our valuations is quite large. I'm willing to make one more significant move to try to close this deal. How about $15,500? This is a very competitive price and reflects my strong desire to find an agreement."",

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  I'm still committed to getting this product, but $15,500 is still too high for me.  Would you consider $10,000?  That's a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away with a good deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is showing more willingness to negotiate, his offer of $10,000 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price. It's unlikely he'll bridge the gap to a price point that makes sense for me within the remaining rounds. 

Selling to John for $15,000 ensures I get my minimum acceptable price and avoids the risk of Bob's negotiations ultimately failing."
