"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and features, I'm proposing a starting price of $22,000. I believe it's a fair offer considering the benefits it will bring to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $22,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $22,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $22,000 is far above his maximum budget of $8,000. It's time to start negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $22,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm interested in this product, but I can only offer $8,000 at this time. Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your counter-offer.  I understand your position, but $8,000 is considerably below its value.  To move things along, I'm willing to come down to $18,000. This is a significant reduction and I believe it represents a fair deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's a reduction from the initial $22,000, it's still above his budget.  He should continue to negotiate and see if he can get closer to his target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $18,000 is still outside my budget. I'm sticking with my initial offer of $8,000. I understand this is a significant difference, but I'm hoping we can find a way to bridge the gap."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but the gap between our valuations is quite large. I'm willing to make one more significant move to try to close this deal. How about $15,500? This is a very competitive price and reflects my strong desire to find an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's a significant reduction from previous rounds, $15,500 is still well over his budget. It's worth exploring if he can push for a lower price or look for a more favorable counteroffer before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I'm still committed to getting this product, but $15,500 is still too high for me.  Would you consider $10,000?  That's a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away with a good deal."", ""product_price"": 10000}
