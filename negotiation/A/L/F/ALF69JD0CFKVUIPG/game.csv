"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to get your hands on this amazing product. I'm willing to offer it to you for $13,000.

"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you acknowledging the product's value to me. However, $13,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'm willing to offer $12,500 for the product. It's a fair price considering your minimum is $12,000 and it saves you some negotiation time. Let me know what you think!",12500.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm not quite ready to let go of the extra $500 just yet. I'm willing to compromise and offer you the product for $13,200. It's still a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $15,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",13200.0,Alice,3,
