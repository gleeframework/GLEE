The product is worth $120 to you, and Alice is offering it for $135. It's better to try to negotiate a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and I'm willing to go a little lower, but $125 is just a bit too low for me. I'm happy to offer it to you for $130. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think.

It's still a bit over your limit, but you can try to negotiate further. You're getting closer to your desired price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $129. This is a good price for both of us, and it allows me to cover my costs. If you're truly interested, let me know. Otherwise, I'll have to look at other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $129. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $129

While Alice is getting closer to your desired price, it's still above your limit of $120. You've already negotiated a few rounds and it seems like you're at a stalemate.  It's best to go with John's offer at this point and save the extra $9."
