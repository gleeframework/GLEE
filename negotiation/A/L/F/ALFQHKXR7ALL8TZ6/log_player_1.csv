Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $115. It's a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

This is a reasonable starting point:

* **It's above your minimum:**  $115 is higher than your minimum value of $120. 
* **It's below John's offer:** This keeps the door open to potentially getting a better price from Bob.
* **It's close to Bob's value:** $115 is only $15 more than Bob's value, so there's room for negotiation. 

Let me know if you'd like to try a different offer, or if you want me to handle Bob's response!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $105. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and counteroffer. While $105 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum desired value. I want to see if I can get closer to my goal of $120."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $105 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $110,  which is still a good deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm offering $110 to Bob, which is still a good deal for him as it's only $5 more than his maximum price.  It's also closer to my desired price of $120."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $107.50? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $107.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $107.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While it's tempting to take $107.50, it's still significantly below my minimum goal of $120.  I'm willing to risk one more counteroffer to see if I can get closer to that."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $107.50 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you at $109.  This would be a good deal for both of us and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 109}
```

This counteroffer is a compromise, offering a price that's closer to Bob's offer but still higher than my minimum goal. It's a good strategy to show that I'm serious about negotiating but still willing to reach a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really close to walking away, but I'm willing to make one more offer. How about $108? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $108
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $120.  This is a much better deal for me than anything I've been able to get from Bob. While I've enjoyed the negotiation process, at this point, it's clear Bob isn't willing to come close to my minimum goal.  It's time to move on and secure the best possible deal."
