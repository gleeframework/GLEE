"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a fantastic product that I think would be a great fit for your needs. I'm offering it to you at $12,500. This is a great deal considering its value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice's starting offer is halfway between her valuation ($10,000) and my maximum ($15,000). There's a good chance I can negotiate a better price by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product but $12,500 is a bit steep for me. How about we settle at $11,000?"",
""product_price"": 11000
}
```

**Reasoning:** I've started with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's opening offer but still leaves room for negotiation. This tests the waters and gives me a sense of how flexible Alice is willing to be."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $11,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, how about $11,500?  Let's meet in the middle and close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice is negotiating, but her counteroffer is still closer to her initial price than mine.  I'll push a little further to see if she's willing to come down more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand that you're looking for a fair price, Alice.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,250?  That's a good compromise for both of us."",
""product_price"": 11250
}
```

**Reasoning:** I've countered with the exact midpoint between our previous offers. This shows Alice I'm willing to compromise but also holds my ground on getting a good deal."
