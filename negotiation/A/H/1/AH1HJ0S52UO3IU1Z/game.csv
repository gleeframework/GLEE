"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1400000. This is a great deal, considering its value to you is $1200000. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm starting with a strong offer.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1100000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. What do you think?",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1100000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1300000. This is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you is $1200000. Let me know if this is something you're interested in.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice, but I'm still a bit short of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1200000, which is the maximum I'm willing to pay. Can you consider this price?",1200000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to go up to $1200000. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $1280000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to me is $1500000. Let me know if this is something you're interested in.",1280000.0,Alice,5,
