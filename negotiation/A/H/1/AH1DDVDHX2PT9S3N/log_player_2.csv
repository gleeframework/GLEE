While $140 is within my budget, I want to try and get a better deal. It's worth exploring if Alice is willing to go lower."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $130 is too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $135?

**Reasoning:**

While $135 is a good price, I'm still hoping to get it for $130. I'm willing to push a little further, but if Alice doesn't budge, I'll need to consider buying from John."
