"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible product, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start the negotiation at $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you is $1,000,000, and I'm willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your maximum value. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price before resorting to John's offer."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your budget constraints, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,050,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. I can offer it to you for $1,175,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the value you place on the product and the minimum price I'm willing to accept.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's counteroffer is lower than her initial offer, it's still above my maximum value.  I'm willing to try one more counteroffer to see if we can reach a price I'm comfortable with."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I can see you're serious about this product. I'm willing to meet you at $1,100,000, but I need to make a bit more to reach my target. I can offer it to you for $1,150,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the value you place on the product and my minimum requirements. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still higher than my maximum value of $1,000,000.  While there's a chance we could negotiate further, it's more likely we'll be stuck in a cycle of counteroffers.  Buying from John guarantees I get the product at my maximum price and avoids further negotiation."
