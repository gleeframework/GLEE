"I'm excited to offer you this incredible product, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start the negotiation at $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you is $1,000,000, and I'm willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial deal.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I see the value in this product, $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm happy to pay up to $1,050,000 for it. Let's see if we can find common ground there.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,050,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. I can offer it to you for $1,175,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the value you place on the product and the minimum price I'm willing to accept.",1175000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,175,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000. This is a fair price, considering the value you place on the product and my maximum budget.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I can see you're serious about this product. I'm willing to meet you at $1,100,000, but I need to make a bit more to reach my target. I can offer it to you for $1,150,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the value you place on the product and my minimum requirements.",1150000.0,Alice,5,
