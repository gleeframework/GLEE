"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really love. I'm willing to let it go for $130, which is a great deal considering its value. What do you think?",130.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am only able to pay up to $80 for it. Would you be willing to meet me halfway?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand you're looking for a good deal.  While $80 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $100.  This would be a fair price for both of us. What do you think?",100.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Unfortunately, $100 is still slightly out of my budget. Could we perhaps meet at $90? I believe this would be a fair compromise.",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  $90 is getting closer, but I'm still a bit short of where I need to be.  How about we split the difference and go with $95?  That would be a fair compromise for both of us.  Let me know what you think!",95.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I understand your position and I appreciate your efforts to reach an agreement. However, I'm still not able to pay $95 for the product. Could we perhaps meet at $90? I believe this would be a fair compromise for both of us.",90.0,Bob,6,
