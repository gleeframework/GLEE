Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $120. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're aiming to get more than $80, and $120 is a good starting point.
* **It's below Bob's value:**  He values the product at $150, so there's room for negotiation.
* **It's a clear and concise message:** It leaves no room for confusion and encourages a quick response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $90 is better than selling to John, there's still room for negotiation to get closer to my desired price.  I'll counteroffer Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is still a little low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $105?  That's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand, Alice.  While $105 is closer, I'm still aiming a bit lower. How about $98? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $98. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $98
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

$98 is a good compromise and pretty close to my desired price. It's also significantly more than selling to John.  I'll take it!"
