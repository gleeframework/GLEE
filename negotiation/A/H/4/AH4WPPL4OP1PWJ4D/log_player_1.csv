I'm starting with a price of $15,000.  This is a reasonable starting point, as it's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.  It also allows for some room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my minimum, I still believe I can get a better price. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer and see if we can find a middle ground."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm offering $13,500. This is a compromise, closer to Bob's offer but still leaves some room for negotiation. I believe it's a fair price considering my minimum and Bob's offer."

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I was hoping for a slightly higher price,  $13,000 is a good deal and significantly more than my minimum acceptable price. It's also a fair compromise considering the back-and-forth negotiation."
