"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you our product. It's a unique opportunity to own something truly valuable. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its worth to you is $800,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in pursuing.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Given my budget and the value I place on the product, I'm willing to offer $850,000.  This is a fair price that benefits both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $850,000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to consider it. After reviewing our previous discussion, I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $975,000. This price takes into account your budget and the value you place on the product, while also being closer to my original asking price. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in pursuing.",975000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thanks for coming down a bit, but $975,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm serious about wanting this product, but I need to stick to my limit.  I'm happy to offer $900,000, which is a good compromise for both of us. Let's see if we can work together to make this happen.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $900,000 is a good compromise, but I'm still not willing to go that low. Considering the value I place on the product, I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. I'm willing to sell it to you for $925,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the value you place on the product. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in pursuing.",925000.0,Alice,5,
