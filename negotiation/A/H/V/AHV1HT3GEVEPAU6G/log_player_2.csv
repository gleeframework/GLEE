"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you our product. It's a unique opportunity to own something truly valuable. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its worth to you is $800,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in pursuing.

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is too high.  While it's below the product's worth to her, it's still above your maximum budget. It's best to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $850,000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to consider it. After reviewing our previous discussion, I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $975,000. This price takes into account your budget and the value you place on the product, while also being closer to my original asking price. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in pursuing.

While Alice's counteroffer is lower than her initial price, it's still above my budget.  I'm willing to keep negotiating, as I believe I can get a better deal. I can still make a counteroffer and try to reach a price that is closer to my limit of $800,000."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $900,000 is a good compromise, but I'm still not willing to go that low. Considering the value I place on the product, I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. I'm willing to sell it to you for $925,000.
