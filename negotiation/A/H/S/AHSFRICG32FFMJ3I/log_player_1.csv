"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm starting high, knowing the product is worth $100 to me and hoping to get as close to that as possible. I'm confident Bob will counteroffer, and we can then negotiate from there."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $90 is better than nothing, I'm hoping to get closer to my minimum of $100. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 95}
```

I'm going to counter with $95. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer, and I think it's a fair price that we can both agree on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I'd love to get closer to $100, we're already halfway through the rounds, and it's getting risky to keep rejecting offers. $92 is still a good profit for me, and I don't want to risk losing the deal completely."
