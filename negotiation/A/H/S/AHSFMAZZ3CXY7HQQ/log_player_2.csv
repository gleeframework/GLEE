"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a valuable asset, and I believe this price reflects its worth. I'm confident you'll see the potential in this opportunity. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is significantly above your maximum valuation.  You should reject the offer and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,200,000 is too high for me.  I'd be willing to pay $800,000.  I believe that's a fair price that reflects the value of the product."",
 ""product_price"": 800000
}
``` 

This counter-offer is a significant step down from Alice's initial offer but still leaves room for further negotiation. By starting lower, you show Alice you're serious about getting a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000, which is still a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000

Alice has come down to your maximum price. There's no point in negotiating further or buying from John, as you won't get a better deal."
