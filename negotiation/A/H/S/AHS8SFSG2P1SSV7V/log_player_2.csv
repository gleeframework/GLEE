Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $9,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm still willing to make a deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $7,500. It's a great compromise that still reflects the product's value to you.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $7,000 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $7,250. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

**Reasoning:**  

While Alice is coming down in price, it's clear she's unlikely to go much lower than $7,250. At this point, the potential savings of a few hundred dollars by continuing to negotiate with Alice are outweighed by the risk that she won't budge further.  Buying from John for $8,000 guarantees you get the product and avoids the uncertainty of further haggling."
