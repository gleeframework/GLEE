"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product, and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $140. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's initial offer is too high. We can try to negotiate a better price in the following rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $140 is a bit steep for me. Could you do $110?"",
""product_price"": 110
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  I'm starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's asking price. This leaves room for negotiation and signals that I'm looking for a good deal.
* **Not Insultingly Low:** While I'm aiming low, $110 is still above Alice's perceived value of the product ($120), giving her a potential profit margin. 
* **Polite and Open:** The message aims to keep the negotiation friendly and collaborative."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. How about we meet in the middle at $125? That's a very fair offer considering its value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Room to Negotiate:** While $125 is closer to a reasonable price, it's still above my target. Alice moving towards my offer suggests there's flexibility.
* **Limited Rounds:**  With only a few rounds left, I want to apply a bit more pressure to see if I can get closer to $110. 
* **John as Backup:** I'm keeping John's offer in mind as a fallback if I can't get a satisfactory price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  How about we settle at $115?  That's a fair compromise, don't you think?"",
""product_price"": 115
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** By suggesting $115, I'm signaling a willingness to compromise but also holding my ground near my desired price range.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  As rounds progress, I'm conveying a slight sense of urgency to encourage Alice to accept a deal sooner rather than later.
* **Positive Tone:**  Maintaining a positive and collaborative tone throughout the negotiation is important for a successful outcome."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're definitely a tough negotiator, Bob!  I'm willing to come down a bit more. How about $120?  That's my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's Bottom Line:** Alice stating ""$120 is my final offer"" strongly suggests she won't go any lower.  This matches her perceived value of the product, so pushing further is unlikely.
* **Good Deal:** $120 is a solid price, well below my $150 maximum and a decent saving compared to John's offer.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Continuing to negotiate has risks. Alice might not budge, and I'd end up with a worse deal or having to go with John anyway."
