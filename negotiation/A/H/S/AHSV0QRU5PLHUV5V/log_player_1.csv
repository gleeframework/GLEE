Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $100. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it."", ""product_price"": 100}
```

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above Bob's value:**  Bob values the product at $80, so he might be willing to pay a bit more.
* **It's below your minimum:** It's above your minimum of $120, so you still make a profit.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** If Bob counteroffers, you can still negotiate up to your minimum.

By starting at $100, you establish a strong initial position and leave room for Bob to counteroffer without you immediately having to accept a price lower than you'd like."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because:

* **It's below my minimum:**  I'm not willing to sell the product for less than $120. 
* **I have a better option:** Selling to John for $120 guarantees me a better profit. 

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can either make a counteroffer to Bob or move on to John.  However, since John is willing to pay my minimum, it's safer to sell to him right away."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $105. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 105} 
```

Here's why this is a good counteroffer:

* **It's a compromise:** It's higher than Bob's offer but lower than my initial offer, showing flexibility.
* **It's still above my minimum:** I'm still making a profit at $105.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** If Bob rejects this, I can still consider going down a little more, but only if it's closer to my minimum. 

This counteroffer demonstrates that I'm willing to negotiate but also that I'm not desperate to sell at any price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not sure $105 is a good deal for me. I'd be willing to pay $95 for the product. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While Bob's offer of $95 is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below it. I'm not willing to sell for less than $120, and John is already offering that price.  Selling to John is the most logical choice right now, as it guarantees me the best possible profit."
