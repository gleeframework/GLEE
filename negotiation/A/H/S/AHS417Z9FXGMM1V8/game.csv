"Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in. I'm offering it to you for $15000. It's a unique opportunity, and I'm confident it's worth the price. What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the uniqueness of the product, but I am looking to keep my expenses within a certain budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $14000?",14000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While $14000 is a good offer, I'm still hoping to get closer to my original asking price. How about we split the difference and settle on $14500? It's a fair compromise that allows both of us to walk away feeling satisfied.",14500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still not able to meet at $14500. Could we perhaps aim for $14000? This would allow me to stay within my budget while also acknowledging the value of the product.",14000.0,Bob,4,
