I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This is higher than my minimum value, but it gives me room to negotiate if Bob counteroffers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

$7,000 is significantly lower than my minimum value, so I'm rejecting Bob's offer and will counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $10,000. This is still above my minimum value, but lower than my initial offer, showing I'm willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $8,500 is closer to my minimum value, I'm still not satisfied with the price. I'm going to counteroffer again, hoping to get closer to my desired amount."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm counteroffering at $9,500.  This is a smaller increment than before, showing that I'm getting closer to a possible deal with Bob, but still above my minimum value."
