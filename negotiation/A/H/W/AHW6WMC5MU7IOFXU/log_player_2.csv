"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is a good price, it's still above Alice's value of $8,000. This means there's room for negotiation. By rejecting the offer, Bob can attempt to get a better price and save more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to get a price as close as possible to Alice's value of $8,000. This counteroffer of $10,000 is a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer of $12,000, leaving room for potential compromise.  It also allows Bob to gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above Bob's desired price point, which is likely closer to $10,000. There's still room to negotiate and potentially get a better deal by rejecting this offer and counter-offering again. Bob is still better off than buying from John at $15,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is slowly increasing his offer, demonstrating his willingness to negotiate while still trying to keep the price below $11,000.  This counteroffer of $10,500 is a slight increase from his previous offer, showing flexibility but still leaving room for a potential compromise.  It also puts pressure on Alice to potentially meet him halfway."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $11,000 is now within Bob's budget and is a good compromise.  While Bob could try to negotiate further, the risk of losing the deal to John or further delaying the purchase is too high. Accepting this offer allows Bob to secure the product at a reasonable price."
