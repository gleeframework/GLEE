"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $1,500,000 to you. Let's make this happen!",1400000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, your offer is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit too low for me. How about $1,300,000? That's still a great deal for you, and it gets us closer to a deal. Let's find a middle ground!",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm still interested in the product, but $1,300,000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,250,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it keeps us within a reasonable range. Let's close this deal!",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,250,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,275,000. This is a fair compromise that allows us both to get a good deal. Let's finalize this!",1275000.0,Alice,5,
