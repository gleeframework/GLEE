Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd find valuable. I'm willing to offer it to you for $175. Let me know if you're interested!"", 
""product_price"": 175
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Value:**  You know Bob values the product at $150, giving you room to negotiate above your minimum.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $175 allows for potential counter-offers from Bob while still aiming for a price higher than your guaranteed $150 from John.
* **Not Being Too Greedy:**  While you could aim higher, a smaller price difference makes it more likely Bob will accept without further negotiation."
