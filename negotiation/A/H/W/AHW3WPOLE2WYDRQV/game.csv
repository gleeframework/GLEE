"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm about the product. However, $1100000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to offer $950000. I believe this is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident it will be a profitable investment for you as well.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $950000 is a bit below your target, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a price of $1050000. This is the best I can do, and I believe it's a fair compromise considering the value of the product.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but I'm still a little hesitant at $1050000.  I'm willing to go up to $1000000.  I believe this is a fair price considering the value of the product, and it would allow me to proceed with this investment.  Would you be willing to consider this offer?",1000000.0,Bob,4,
