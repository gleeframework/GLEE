``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's significantly lower than my minimum price of $1,000,000, but still leaves room for negotiation.  I'm hoping to leverage Bob's interest and potentially reach a deal close to my desired price. If he rejects, I'll be ready to counteroffer and explore other options."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product, but I'm looking to keep my expenses within a certain budget. Would you consider selling the product for $850,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $850,000 is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum threshold of $1,000,000. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my minimum.  It's important to remember that I have the option to sell to John for $1,000,000 at any point, so I have some leverage in this negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, I believe the value of this product justifies a slightly higher price. Let's meet in the middle at $950,000. This price reflects the product's exceptional qualities and allows for a mutually beneficial deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I've considered your proposal, Alice. While I respect the value of your product, I believe we can still find common ground. Could you possibly lower the price to $925,000? This would allow us to move forward while staying within my budget constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer of $925,000.  While it's still below my ideal price, it's getting closer to my minimum.  I'm confident that I can make a good profit on this sale.  It's also important to remember that selling to John for $1,000,000 is always an option, but there's a chance that Bob might reject my next counteroffer, making this deal more risky."
