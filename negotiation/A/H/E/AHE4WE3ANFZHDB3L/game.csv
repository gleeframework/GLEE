"Hi Alice, $200 is a bit steep for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I can only go up to $100.  Let me know what you think.",100.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $200 is already a steal for this product! How about we meet in the middle at $160? It's a fair price considering the value you'll be getting.",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $160 is still too high for me. I'm really keen on this product, but my absolute limit is $120. Let's see if we can find common ground.",120.0,Bob,4,
