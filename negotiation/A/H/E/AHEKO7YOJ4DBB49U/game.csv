"I appreciate your time, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider my offer?",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $750,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to stay above $800,000 to make this worthwhile.  Let's compromise at $825,000. It's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to cover my minimum value. What do you say?",825000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $825,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $750,000 and $825,000, which would be $787,500. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price point.",787500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $787,500 is still too low for me.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to drop my price to $805,000.  This is a significant compromise on my end, and it's the absolute lowest I can go.  Let's finalize this deal at this price, and both of us can walk away happy.",805000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $805,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $795,000 and $805,000, which would be $800,000. However, I'd like to make a slight adjustment to $797,500. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price point.",797500.0,Bob,6,
