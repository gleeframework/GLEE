"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm definitely interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Could you consider coming down to $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand your budget constraints, Bob. However, I have to consider the value that this product brings to the table. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I can offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is my best and final offer for now.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Thanks Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  How about we split the difference between our last offers and land at $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"I like your thinking, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $1,000,000. I can do $1,050,000, which is still a compromise, but it's the lowest I'm willing to go. This is my final offer.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
