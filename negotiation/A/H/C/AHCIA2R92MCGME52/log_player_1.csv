"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1000000} 

I'm starting high, aiming for a price that reflects the product's value to me.  However, I'm open to negotiation and will assess Bob's response carefully."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, I want to see if I can squeeze out a bit more. I'll reject his offer and try to counter with a slightly higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000} 
```

I'm counteroffering at $900,000. This is still a significant discount from my initial offer, but it's closer to my minimum acceptable price. I want to see if Bob is willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is lower than my minimum acceptable price, and I've already made a counteroffer.  I'm not confident I'll be able to get a better price with further negotiations.  It's time to secure the deal with John for $800,000, which is my minimum."
