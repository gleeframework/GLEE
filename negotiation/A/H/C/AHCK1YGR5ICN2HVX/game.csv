"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,000,000. I believe this is reflective of its worth, but I'm open to discussing further.",1000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,000,000 is quite a bit higher than my budget.  Considering the value you've mentioned, I'm willing to offer $850,000. I'm eager to close this deal, but need to stay within my financial constraints.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming back with an offer.  To be frank, $850,000 is a bit too low for me to consider.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $950,000. I'm confident this product will exceed your expectations and generate significant value.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $950,000 is still outside my comfortable range. I'm willing to increase my offer to $900,000.  This shows my serious interest in acquiring the product, but I need to stay within my budget.  What are your thoughts?",900000.0,Bob,4,
