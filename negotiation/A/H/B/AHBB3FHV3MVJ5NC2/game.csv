"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this exceptional product with you. I believe it has the potential to bring significant value to your business. I'm open to negotiations, but I want to start with a price that reflects its true worth. I'm offering the product to you for $1500000.",1500000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $1500000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your interest in the product, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to make a counteroffer. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $1200000. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I believe the product's value is closer to $1400000. Would you be open to discussing a compromise around that number?",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1400000, Alice, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1300000. Is that a number you'd be comfortable with?",1300000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I see you're willing to meet me halfway, Bob, but I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to make another concession, but I think $1350000 is a more reasonable price for the product. I'm open to further discussion, but I'd like to see some movement from your end.",1350000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to make another concession, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $1350000. I'm willing to meet you at $1250000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. I'm starting to think that this product is worth a lot to you, and I'd like to get a better sense of its value to you before we proceed.",1250000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to get a sense of the product's value to me, Bob, but I'm not willing to disclose that information. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1300000, but I'm open to discussing further. I'm not willing to go any lower than that, though.",1300000.0,Alice,7,

"I appreciate your willingness to make another concession, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $1300000. I'm willing to meet you at $1200000, but I'm starting to think that's the best I can do. I'd like to know if you're willing to meet me at that price or if we're at an impasse.",1200000.0,Bob,8,
