Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I know it's of significant value to you, and after careful consideration, I'm proposing a price of $2,250,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and potential.  What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 2250000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since I have a guaranteed buyer at $1,500,000 (my minimum acceptable price), I can start with a significantly higher offer to Bob.
* **Testing the waters:** This initial offer allows me to gauge Bob's interest and willingness to pay a premium. 
* **Room for negotiation:** Even if Bob counters, there's a good chance we can settle on a price significantly higher than $1,500,000.

By starting high and being open to negotiation, I maximize my chances of securing the best possible price from Bob."
