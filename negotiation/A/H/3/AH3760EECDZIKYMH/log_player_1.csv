{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd be interested in. I'm asking for $140 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

This offer starts at a price slightly below what Bob values the product at, leaving room for negotiation.  It's important to start with a strong offer, but not one that's immediately rejected."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for offering the product, Alice. I appreciate it. However, I was hoping to find a price closer to $100. Would it be possible for you to lower the price a bit? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still below my minimum threshold of $100. I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but I'm still trying to get a fair amount for the product.  How about we meet in the middle at $120?  This is still a great deal for you, considering the product is worth $150 to you. "", ""product_price"": 120}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello again, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Considering the product's value to me, I would like to propose a price of $110. I hope this is acceptable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $110 is very close to my minimum threshold of $100.  It's not ideal, but it's a better deal than selling to John. I'll accept it to avoid further negotiation and secure a sale."
