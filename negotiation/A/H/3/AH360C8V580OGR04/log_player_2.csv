"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'm willing to offer you the product for $800,000. I think this is a fair starting point, considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is a great starting point, but I can likely get a better price.  Rejecting the offer allows me to make a counteroffer and potentially save more money."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand your perspective, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. However, I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to lower the price to $850,000. I think this is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you and my initial offer. What do you think?

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to my target price, I'm still confident I can get a better deal.  I'm going to reject her offer and counter again, aiming for a price closer to $700,000."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make one more concession. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $825,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to you and my initial offer. I think this is a fair compromise, and I'm willing to move forward with the sale if you're willing to meet me at this price. What do you think?

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down significantly, and her offer is now only $75,000 more than my initial counteroffer. While I could try to negotiate further, it's likely that Alice won't budge much more.  At this price, I'm still saving a significant amount compared to buying from John, and it's a reasonable price considering the value of the product to me. It's time to close the deal."
