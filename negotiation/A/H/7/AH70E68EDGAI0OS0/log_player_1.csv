{""product_price"": 20000}

I'm starting with a price of $20,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price of $15,000, but it leaves room for negotiation.  I'm hoping to gauge Bob's interest and see how high he's willing to go."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $15,000 is my minimum, I'm hoping to get a bit more. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 18000} 
```

I'm offering $18,000, which is halfway between my minimum and Bob's offer. This shows that I'm willing to compromise, but I still believe the product is worth more than $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $16,000 is a good compromise.  It's higher than John's offer, and it's only $2,000 less than my initial asking price. I'm happy to accept and sell the product to Bob."
