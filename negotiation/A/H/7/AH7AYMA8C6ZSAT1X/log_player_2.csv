"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,400,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as it's well below your estimated value and significantly higher than what I could get elsewhere.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $1,100,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1,300,000. This still leaves you with a good profit margin, and it's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's meet in the middle!
