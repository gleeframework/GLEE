"Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,400,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as it's well below your estimated value and significantly higher than what I could get elsewhere.  Let me know what you think!",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $1,400,000 is a bit high for me.  Would you consider $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $1,100,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1,300,000. This still leaves you with a good profit margin, and it's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's meet in the middle!",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you're not willing to go as low as $1,100,000. How about we meet in the middle at $1,200,000? That seems like a fair compromise.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
