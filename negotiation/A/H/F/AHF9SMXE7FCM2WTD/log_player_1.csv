Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I need to stay within my budget. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000.

I'm willing to be flexible, but $900,000 is a significant way off from where I see this product's value.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000? This feels like a fair price that reflects the true worth of what's being offered."", ""product_price"": 1100000}"

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, I'm still a bit far from being comfortable with the price. Would you be willing to consider $950,000? I'm trying to find a mutually beneficial price that works for both of us.

While Bob is showing willingness to negotiate, he's still significantly below my minimum. It's time to cut my losses and take John's guaranteed offer."
