"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $15,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $12,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the price.  While I value your interest, $12,000 is a bit too low for me to accept. How about we meet in the middle at $13,500?",13500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thank you for the revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $12,500? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my means.",12500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm sensing we're getting close. I'm willing to come down slightly more. How about $12,500?  This is my final offer, as I need to consider other potential buyers if we can't find an agreement.",12500.0,Alice,7,
