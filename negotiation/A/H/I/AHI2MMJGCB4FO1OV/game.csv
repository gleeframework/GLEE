"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. I'm willing to pay a fair price for the product, but I'm on a tight budget. Can you meet me halfway?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your budget concerns, Bob, but $90 is quite a bit lower than what I had in mind.  Could you do $140?  That's a significant reduction on my initial offer.",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $140 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again. Could you consider $110? I'm really interested in this product, and I'm willing to pay a fair price, but I need to stay within my budget.",110.0,Bob,4,
