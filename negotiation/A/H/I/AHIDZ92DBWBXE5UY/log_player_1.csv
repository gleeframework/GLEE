"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000} 
```

I'm starting with a price of $13,000. This is a significant discount from my minimum value of $15,000, but it leaves room for negotiation and still ensures I earn a decent profit.  I'm confident Bob will see the value in this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low. While it's tempting to take the $11,000, I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price. I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000} 
```

I'm offering $12,000. This is a compromise from my previous offer, but still higher than Bob's offer.  I'm hoping this will show him I'm serious about negotiating but also willing to be flexible."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm still not comfortable with Bob's offer. While it's getting closer, I'm going to risk it and counteroffer again.  I'm starting to feel the pressure of the limited rounds, but I'm not willing to settle for a price that's too far below my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11500} 
```

I'm offering $11,500. This is a significant drop from my previous offer, but I'm hoping it will be enough to convince Bob. I'm getting closer to his offer, but I'm still holding onto some profit. I'm hoping we can reach an agreement soon, as the rounds are ticking away."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I've reached my limit.  Bob's offer is getting too low, and with only four rounds left, the risk of not getting a better price is too high. I'm going to sell to John for $15,000. This guarantees me my minimum price and avoids the risk of a drawn-out negotiation that might not result in a satisfactory outcome."
