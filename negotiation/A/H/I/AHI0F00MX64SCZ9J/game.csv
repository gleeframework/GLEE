"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the opportunity, $10,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Considering the product's value to you, I'd be willing to pay $9,000. This allows for a healthy profit margin for you and saves me some money. What do you think?",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and would like to make a counteroffer. Given the value this product holds for you, I propose we agree on a price of $9,500. This still allows for a good profit margin while being reasonable for you.",9500.0,Alice,3,
