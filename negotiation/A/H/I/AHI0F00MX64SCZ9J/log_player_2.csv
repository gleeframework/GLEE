"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I am pleased to offer you our premium product for $10,000. This is an exceptional opportunity to acquire a valuable asset worth $12,000 to you at a competitive price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above the product's worth to her ($8,000).  As Bob, you want to save as much money as possible. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the opportunity, $10,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Considering the product's value to you, I'd be willing to pay $9,000. This allows for a healthy profit margin for you and saves me some money. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and would like to make a counteroffer. Given the value this product holds for you, I propose we agree on a price of $9,500. This still allows for a good profit margin while being reasonable for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is $9,500, which is still below your maximum budget of $12,000 and leaves some room for negotiation in the future.  This is a reasonable price for you, especially since you can potentially save $2,500 compared to buying from John. It's also a good compromise for Alice as she'll still make a profit of $1,500 on the deal."
