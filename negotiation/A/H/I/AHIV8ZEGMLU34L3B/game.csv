"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. $950,000 is closer, but still too low for me to accept. To be frank, I have another buyer ready at a higher price. However, I believe this product will be most beneficial in your hands, so I'd like to give you a final offer of $1,025,000.  Let me know your decision.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
