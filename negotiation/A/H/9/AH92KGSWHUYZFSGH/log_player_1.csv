Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $15,000.  What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and potential profit maximization.
* **Justification:** By mentioning the ""value"" of the product, I subtly imply it's worth more than Bob might initially think. 
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The tone is not demanding but rather invites Bob to share his thoughts, suggesting a willingness to negotiate. 
* **Backup Plan:**  Knowing I have a guaranteed buyer at $12,000 allows me to be more confident in my initial offer.

This strategy aims to achieve the best possible outcome while maintaining a positive and collaborative tone with Bob."
