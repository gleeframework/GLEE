You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer

Alice's offer is a good deal, but it's possible to get a better price. If you reject her offer, you can try to negotiate a lower price or see if she'll counter-offer.  You can always go with John for $1,500,000 if needed, so you have some bargaining power."
