"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $110. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

Since you're looking to save as much money as possible, and the product is worth $100 to you,  it makes sense to reject Alice's initial offer of $110. You can try to negotiate a lower price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you're willing to work with me. I'm really interested in this product, but $110 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying. Would you be willing to go down to $105? "", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still looking to get a good value for my product. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our prices. How about $107.50? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $107.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $107.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While $107.5 is better than Alice's initial offer, it's still more than the $100 you're willing to pay. You can try to negotiate a lower price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet me halfway, but I'm still a little bit above my budget.  Would you be willing to come down to $102.50?  I'm very interested in this product, but I need to make sure it fits within my spending plan."", ""product_price"": 102.5}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make another concession. However, I'm not willing to go below $105. I think that's a fair price considering the value this product brings. Would you be willing to meet me at $105? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
``` 

You've reached a point where Alice is unwilling to go lower than $105. While this is a better price than her initial offer, it's still above your maximum budget of $100.  Since you have the option to buy from John for $100, it's the most financially responsible decision at this point."
