"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 170}
```

I'm starting with a price higher than what I know the product is worth to Bob. This is a common negotiation tactic to see if he's willing to pay a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I can still do better. I'm confident that I can get a price closer to my minimum of $150.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 160}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly, but I'm still holding firm on getting a price higher than what I know the product is worth to Bob. I'm aiming to meet him halfway, but I'm not giving in completely."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $145
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer again. While it's getting closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a bit more.  I'll counteroffer again in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 155}
```

I'm lowering my price again to $155. This is getting very close to my minimum and I'm hoping that Bob will accept this offer. I'm confident that I can get a better price from John if Bob continues to reject my offers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $148. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $148
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While I'm close to my minimum,  it's getting very risky to continue negotiating with Bob. He's clearly not willing to pay more than $148, and I'm not sure I can convince him otherwise. John is offering my minimum, and I'm confident I can get the same amount from him.  Therefore, I'm going to sell to John and avoid any further risk."
