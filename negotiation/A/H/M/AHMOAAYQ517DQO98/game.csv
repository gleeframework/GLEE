"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me right now. Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that the product is worth a premium. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a compromise that I believe is fair, considering the value it will bring to your business.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $1,000,000 is your maximum budget, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $1,050,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
