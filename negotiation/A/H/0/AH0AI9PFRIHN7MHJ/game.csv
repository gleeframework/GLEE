"Hi Alice,  $950,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to get a better deal.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but I can't go that low.  How about $900,000?  That gives us both a good deal and keeps the negotiation moving forward.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $875,000 is still too low for me.  Let's split the difference at $887,500. This is a fair price that gets us closer to an agreement. What do you say?",887500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $887,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $880,000. This is a fair price that's closer to where I need to be, and I'm confident we can close the deal at this price.",880000.0,Bob,6,
