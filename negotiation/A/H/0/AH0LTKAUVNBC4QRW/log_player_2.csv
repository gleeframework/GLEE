You should reject Alice's offer. It's still too high for your desired price range. You have room to negotiate and potentially get a better deal."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice. While I appreciate you, $13,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product, given its value to me. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 10000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but $10,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $11,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500

Alice has moved closer to your desired price range and $11,500 is a good deal for you.  You can save $3,500 compared to buying from John."
