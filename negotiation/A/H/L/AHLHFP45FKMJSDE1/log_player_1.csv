"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a unique product that I believe will be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $20,000.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 20000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price of $20,000, which is significantly higher than my minimum. This allows for room to negotiate down if necessary.
* **Positive tone:** I'm using a positive and friendly tone to build rapport with Bob.
* **Highlighting value:**  I'm emphasizing the potential value of the product to Bob. 

This approach aims to establish a starting point for negotiation while also leaving room to adjust based on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of the product might be high, but my budget is limited. Could we perhaps agree on a price closer to $10000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $10,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than my minimum value of $15,000. I'm not willing to sell at such a low price yet. 

I'll counter with a price closer to my minimum, hoping to find a compromise that's more favorable. I have 8 more rounds to negotiate with Bob, so there's still time to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $10,000 is below my minimum, I'm willing to consider a price closer to your offer.  How about $17,000? This gives us both some room to compromise and ensures I can still cover the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 17000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Acknowledging Bob's offer:** I'm showing respect for Bob's position by acknowledging his offer and explaining why it's not feasible.
* **Counter-offering with a compromise:** I'm offering $17,000, which is closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum. This shows willingness to compromise while maintaining a reasonable price.
* **Highlighting mutual benefit:** I'm framing the offer as a compromise that benefits both parties. This can encourage Bob to accept the offer and move forward with the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a price of $15000 for the product. I hope this proposal is acceptable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $15,000 is exactly my minimum. This is a good deal for me, considering I could sell to John for the same price.  While there's always a chance I could get a slightly higher price, I'm not willing to risk losing the deal altogether. It's time to accept and move on."
