# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500

It's worth trying to get a lower price from Alice. You can counteroffer and see if she's willing to negotiate."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer but I can't go that low.  How about $11,000? That's a fair price considering the value of the product, and it's still lower than what I'd be getting elsewhere. Let's find a middle ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000.

You can still try to negotiate a lower price with Alice.  You're close to your target of $10,000.  A counteroffer might lead to a better deal."
