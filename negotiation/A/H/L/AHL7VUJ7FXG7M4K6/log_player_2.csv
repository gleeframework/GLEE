Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob! However, $100 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to compromise further, so I'm counteroffering at $140. This is my final offer, and I'm confident you'll love the product at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140

It's clear Alice is unlikely to go below $120.  Since you have the option to buy from John for $100, it's in your best interest to do so and maximize your savings."
