"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $9,500. I'm willing to pay that amount, but I'm not sure I can go any higher. Let me know what you think!",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $9,500 is still a bit lower than I can accept. How about we meet in the middle at $11,000? This would still be a great deal for you, and it would allow me to make a fair profit. Let's see if we can reach an agreement! ",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, but $11,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $10,200, but no higher. I think that's a fair price considering the product's value to me. Let me know if that's something you'd be willing to consider.",10200.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your persistence. I'm willing to go down to $10,500 as a final offer. This is a significant compromise on my end, but it's the closest I can come to meeting your price. If you're not able to accept this, I'll have to move on to another buyer.  Let me know your decision.",10500.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $10,500 and my previous offer of $10,200. I'll make a counteroffer of $10,350. If you're willing to accept this, I'll buy the product from you.",10350.0,Bob,6,
