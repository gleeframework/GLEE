"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $175. It's a great deal for you and I'm sure you'll find it very useful."", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price above Bob's perceived value, but still within a range that might entice him to negotiate. 
* **Positive Framing:** I'm using positive language to emphasize the value of the product to Bob.
* **Room for Negotiation:** This price leaves room for potential negotiation in the following rounds.

**Important Note:** This is just the first offer.  I will continue to adjust my strategy based on Bob's responses in subsequent rounds to maximize my profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer. While I'm interested, $175 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $80 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** $80 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Opportunity for Negotiation:** I need to continue negotiating with Bob to try and reach a price closer to my desired value. 
* **Selling to John is a Backup:** While selling to John for $150 is a guaranteed profit, I believe I can potentially get a better price from Bob through further negotiation. 

**Next Steps:**

I'll send a counteroffer to Bob in the next round, aiming to bring the price closer to my minimum acceptable value while still being open to negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $80 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $130. This price still gives you a good deal and allows me to make a fair profit.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 130}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm lowering my price from $175 to $130, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate.
* **Fair Price:** $130 is still significantly above Bob's offer of $80, but allows for potential compromise in subsequent rounds.
* **Positive Framing:** I'm emphasizing the deal for Bob and framing it as a fair price for both of us.

**Next Steps:**

I'm prepared to continue negotiating with Bob. If he rejects my counteroffer, I will adjust my strategy based on his response. However, I'm keeping the option of selling to John open, as I want to ensure I don't lose too much money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  $130 is still a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to go to $100.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to stay within my budget.  Let's see if we can reach a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** $100 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Negotiation Continues:** I'm not yet at a point where I'm willing to sell for less than $150, and I see an opportunity to further negotiate with Bob.
* **Keeping Options Open:** While selling to John is a guarantee of $150, I'm optimistic that I can potentially get a better price from Bob with continued negotiation.

**Next Steps:**

I'll send a counteroffer to Bob in the next round, aiming to bridge the gap between our desired prices. I'll keep in mind the importance of reaching a mutually acceptable price while ensuring I don't lose out on a significant profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to accept $120 for the product. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 120}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** By offering $120, I'm essentially splitting the difference between my last offer of $130 and Bob's offer of $100. This demonstrates a willingness to compromise.
* **Still Above Minimum:** $120 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $150, but it represents a significant concession on my part. 
* **Final Offer Tone:** I'm framing this as a final offer, increasing the pressure on Bob to accept.

**Next Steps:**

If Bob rejects this offer, I will seriously consider selling to John for $150.  I'm nearing my limit on how much I'm willing to reduce the price, and I want to ensure I don't lose out on a significant profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $120 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm sticking with my offer of $100.  If you're serious about selling, this is the best price I can offer.  Let me know if you're willing to accept. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Stalemate:** Bob has been consistent with his offer of $100, and I've already compromised significantly from my initial price. 
* **Profit vs. Time:**  Continuing negotiations could result in a further price reduction, potentially leading to a lower profit. 
* **Guaranteed Profit:** Selling to John for $150 guarantees me a profit and avoids the risk of further negotiation. 

**Decision:**

Given Bob's insistence on $100 and my desire to secure a reasonable profit, I'm choosing to sell the product to John for $150. While it's not the highest price I initially hoped for, it ensures I meet my minimum price requirement and avoids the risk of further negotiation."
