"I appreciate your understanding, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me at this price?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, $850,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to stay above $900,000 to make this worthwhile. I'm offering $925,000. This is a fair price that acknowledges your needs while ensuring I get a reasonable return on this valuable product. Let's find common ground.",925000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $925,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to be at $875,000 or lower. Can you consider this price point?",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget concerns, but $875,000 still doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  I'm willing to make a final concession and come down to $900,000. This price is fair to both of us and allows us to close this deal. Let's meet in the middle and finalize this transaction.",900000.0,Alice,5,
