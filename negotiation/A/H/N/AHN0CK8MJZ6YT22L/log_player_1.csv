Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your understanding, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me at this price?

While $850,000 is a decent offer, I believe I can still get closer to my desired price. I'll counter Bob's offer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, $850,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to stay above $900,000 to make this worthwhile. I'm offering $925,000. This is a fair price that acknowledges your needs while ensuring I get a reasonable return on this valuable product. Let's find common ground."", ""product_price"": 925000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:

While $875,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm not willing to sell for that price yet. I'll see if I can get Bob to come up a bit more in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget concerns, but $875,000 still doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  I'm willing to make a final concession and come down to $900,000.
