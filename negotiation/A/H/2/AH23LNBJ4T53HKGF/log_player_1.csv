"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your interest in the product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially offering it to you for $1,800,000."", 
""product_price"": 1800000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with an ambitious offer, leaving room for negotiation. This anchors the negotiation at a higher point. 
* **Show Confidence:** A strong initial offer signals confidence in the product's value.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The $1,800,000 price tag leaves a substantial margin for negotiation while ensuring I remain well above my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to offer $1,400,000 for it. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,400,000 is a significant amount, it's still substantially below my initial ask and leaves a lot of potential profit on the table. I'm willing to negotiate, but not to that extent this early in the process.  I'll provide a counteroffer to see if we can find a more agreeable middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  I'm confident in the value this product brings. To move us closer, I'm willing to come down to $1,650,000."", 
""product_price"": 1650000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** My counteroffer splits the difference between my initial ask and Bob's offer, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate while still aiming high.
* **Strategic Concession:** By making a significant concession ($150,000), I signal to Bob that I am serious about reaching a deal but expect movement on his end as well.
* **Maintaining a Strong Position:** The $1,650,000 price point still allows for a healthy profit margin and keeps the negotiation anchored above my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand the value of the product, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to offer $1,500,000 for it. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is moving closer to my range, but $1,500,000 is still a significant amount less than my initial ask. I believe the product is worth more and I'm willing to push for a better deal. We're not so far apart that a compromise can't be reached. I'll continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. Let's find a compromise. If I reduce the price to $1,575,000, would that be agreeable to you?"", 
""product_price"": 1575000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference (Again):**  This counteroffer meets Bob halfway between his last offer ($1,500,000) and my previous ask ($1,650,000).
* **Signaling Flexibility:** By consistently showing a willingness to move towards his price, I aim to build trust and encourage Bob to reciprocate.
* **Maintaining Profitability:** While this offer is a significant reduction from my initial ask, it still provides a substantial profit margin above my minimum. 
* **Sense of Urgency (Implicit):** As we're now past the halfway point of the negotiation, subtly implying a sense of urgency might encourage Bob to make a decision."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting closer to the price I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to offer $1,525,000 for the product. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,525,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,525,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Profit:** While not ideal, $1,525,000 is still a very good offer and represents a significant profit above my minimum. 
* **Negotiation Fatigue:** After several rounds, it's clear Bob is committed to negotiating but is unlikely to move substantially higher.  
* **Opportunity Cost:**  Continuing to negotiate carries the risk of Bob lowering his offer or walking away altogether. Accepting now secures a good deal and allows me to move on to other opportunities.
* **John as Backup:**  While John provides a safety net, accepting a slightly lower offer from Bob outweighs the potential hassle of restarting negotiations with a new buyer."
