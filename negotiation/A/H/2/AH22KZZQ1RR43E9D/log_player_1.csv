"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

This offer leaves room for negotiation while still securing a profit above my minimum acceptable price.  I'm starting high, knowing Bob values it at $1,500,000, and aiming to meet somewhere in the middle."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $1,300,000.  This price still offers you a good profit while keeping the deal within my budget. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is above my minimum, I'm not ready to settle just yet. There's still room for negotiation, and I'm hoping to get closer to my initial offer of $1,400,000. I'll counter with a slightly lower price to see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to both of us. Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. I'm still aiming for $1,325,000. This price would be a good compromise, allowing you a solid profit margin while staying within my budget. Let's work this out! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,325,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd like to push for a higher price, Bob's offer is getting close to my initial target and we've already had a few rounds of negotiation.  It's better to accept this deal and secure the profit than risk losing him and having to settle with John for a lower amount."
