"Thank you for offering the product, Alice. I understand its value to you, but my budget is limited. I am willing to pay up to $8,800 for the product.",8800.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,800 is a bit too low for me.  Considering the value this product brings, I'm willing to come down to $9,200. This price still allows me a good margin while staying within a range that makes sense for you.  Let me know what you think.",9200.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for adjusting your price. However, I still feel that $9,200 is slightly above my budget. Would you consider lowering it to $8,700? I believe this would be a fair compromise for both of us.",8700.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $8,700 simply doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $9,000. This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a reasonable margin for both of us.  It's my final offer.  Let me know if we can agree.",9000.0,Alice,5,
