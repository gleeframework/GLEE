"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you place on the product, but I am looking to keep my spending within a certain budget. I would like to propose a price of $10,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for the counteroffer.  I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $10,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but how about $11,000?  This allows me to still make a decent profit while giving you a fair price.  What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,
