# Alice's message: I'd like to offer you the opportunity to purchase this exceptional product at a competitive price of $1,100,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer

``` 

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is $1,100,000, which is lower than your maximum budget of $1,200,000. Even though you can get the product from John for the same price, accepting Alice's offer saves you $100,000."
