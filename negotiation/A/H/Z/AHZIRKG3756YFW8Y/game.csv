"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're working with a tighter budget, but I'm still looking to maximize the value of this product. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to ensure I get a fair price. I'm counteroffering at $650,000. I believe this is a reasonable price considering the product's value to you.",650000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to stretch your budget, but I'm still not convinced that $620,000 is a fair price for this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. I'm counteroffering at $630,000. This is my final compromise, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",630000.0,Alice,5,
