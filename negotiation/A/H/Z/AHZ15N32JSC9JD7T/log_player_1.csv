Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,450,000.  I believe this is a very competitive offer considering its true worth. Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1450000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed sale at $1,500,000, aiming slightly lower with Bob allows for potential profit beyond my minimum.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $1,450,000 is significantly more than Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000) but leaves room for him to negotiate if he's very interested.
* **Alternative Buyer:** The message subtly reminds Bob that this is a time-sensitive opportunity, as I have another buyer lined up.

This approach aims to strike a balance between securing a quick sale at a good profit and potentially maximizing earnings if Bob is highly motivated."
