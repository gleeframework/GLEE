Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm asking for $95 for it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

The product is worth $100 to you, and Alice is asking for $95.  You can likely get a better price. It's worth negotiating."

{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $95 is a bit high for me.  How about $85?  I'm interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget."", ""product_price"": 85}
