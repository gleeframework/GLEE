Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal for you, and it's worth more than what you're willing to pay. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm offering the product for $100, which is a compromise between my minimum price ($120) and Bob's estimated value ($80). 
* **Message:** I'm framing the offer as a good deal for Bob, highlighting the value he'll be getting. I'm also leaving the door open for negotiation. 

This strategy aims to:

* **Secure a sale:**  A $100 sale is better than no sale, especially if I can sell to John for $120.
* **Start negotiation:**  By leaving the door open for counteroffers, I can potentially secure a higher price. 
* **Avoid immediate rejection:**  A lower initial offer might make Bob more likely to negotiate instead of immediately rejecting."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice, but that's a bit too steep for me right now. I'd be willing to pay $65 for it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $65. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $65
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $120. While $65 is better than nothing, it's still not a good deal for me. I want to see if I can get closer to my target price by counter-offering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer, but $65 is a bit too low for me. I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to come down a bit more. How about $85? This is a great opportunity for you to get a valuable product at a fair price."", ""product_price"": 85}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm offering the product for $85. This is a compromise between Bob's offer of $65 and my minimum acceptable price of $120. 
* **Message:** I'm emphasizing that I'm willing to negotiate but still maintaining my stance that $65 is too low. I'm also framing the offer as a win-win situation for both of us.

This counteroffer aims to:

* **Move the negotiation forward:** It shows Bob I'm serious about selling but also that I won't settle for a price too far below my minimum.
* **Increase the potential for a deal:**  $85 is closer to Bob's initial estimate of $80, making it more likely he'll accept.
* **Avoid selling to John:**  While selling to John is always an option, I'm trying to maximize my profit by securing a deal with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $75? That seems like a fair compromise to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $75 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still not satisfied with the deal.  I'm willing to negotiate further to see if I can get a better offer from Bob.

* **Reasoning:**  I'm still hoping to get a price closer to $85 or higher.  Selling to John for $120 is always an option, but I want to see if I can secure a better deal with Bob before resorting to that."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $75 is closer, but I'm still hoping to get a bit more for the product. How about $80? That seems like a fair compromise, given the value of the product. I'm confident you'll be happy with it."", ""product_price"": 80}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm offering the product for $80, which is a midpoint between my last offer of $85 and Bob's offer of $75. 
* **Message:** I'm acknowledging Bob's compromise while also stating my belief that the product is worth more than $75. I'm framing the offer as fair and beneficial to both of us.

This counteroffer aims to:

* **Find common ground:** I'm trying to find a price that both Bob and I are comfortable with.
* **Increase the chance of a deal:** By showing flexibility and being willing to compromise, I'm hoping to push Bob toward accepting my offer.
* **Maximize profit:**  While $80 is below my ideal price, it's still significantly better than $75 and closer to my minimum acceptable price of $120."
