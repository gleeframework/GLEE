"Thank you for your response, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to meet somewhere in the middle. In order to move forward, I would like to propose a price of $90 for the product. This still allows us to share the value we each see in it.",90.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you're trying to get the best value for the product.  However,  $90 is still a bit high for me. I'm happy to meet you halfway at $87.50.  This would allow us both to make a reasonable deal.",87.5,Bob,4,
