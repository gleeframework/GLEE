Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, you're really close to the price I was thinking, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $1,000,000. I'll give you a slight nudge, and I'll sell the product to you for $1,002,500. This is my final concession, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?

Bob should buy from John. He's only two rounds away from potentially missing out on the deal with John, and Alice is being stubborn.  It's not worth risking it for an extra $2,500."
