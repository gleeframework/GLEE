"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to purchase my product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $950,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and am open to discussing this further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $950,000 is still too high for him. He can try to get a better price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the price.  While $850,000 is certainly attractive, I'm still confident in its higher value.  How about we meet in the middle at $900,000?  This allows me to acknowledge your interest while still reflecting the product's true worth.

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While $900,000 is better than her first offer, it's still above his target price.  There's still room for negotiation, and Bob can try to get a lower price in the next round."
