Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you today for $130. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides."", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** We know the product is worth $150 to Bob.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $80.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $130 leaves space for potential counter-offers from Bob while still securing a significant profit for you. It's unlikely Bob will accept $150 outright.
* **Alternative Buyer:** You have a safety net with John at $80, so there's less pressure to accept a low offer from Bob. 

This strategy aims to maximize your profit while still making the offer attractive to Bob."
