Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer to send to Bob:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, so you won't accept anything less.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,000,000 to Bob.  
* **Negotiation Room:** There's a potential negotiation space between $1,000,000 and $1,500,000.

**Strategy**

You want to aim high but leave Bob feeling like he's getting a reasonable deal.  Here's a strategy:

1. **Start High:**  Begin with an offer above Bob's perceived value to give yourself room to negotiate.
2. **Justification:**  Provide a reason for the high price (e.g., market value, unique features).
3. **Leave Room:**  Don't start at your absolute minimum; allow for some back-and-forth.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase [product name]. Given its current market value and unique features, I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000. I believe this represents a fair price for the value you'll receive."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Why This Approach Works**

* **Strong Starting Point:**  $1,350,000 is a strong opening, giving you room to negotiate down if needed.
* **Justification:**  By mentioning ""market value and unique features,"" you provide a rationale for the price without revealing your guaranteed sale to John.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The tone suggests you're open to discussing the price further, making Bob more likely to engage.

**Important Note:** This is just one approach. You might adjust the price and message based on your understanding of Bob's negotiation style and your risk tolerance."
