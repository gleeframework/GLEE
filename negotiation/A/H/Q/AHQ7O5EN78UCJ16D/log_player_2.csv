"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on this product. I think you'll find it's worth it. How does $130 sound? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

``` 

While $130 is less than your maximum budget, there's a chance to get a better price. Alice is clearly trying to get a profit margin. Rejecting her offer might lead to a counter-offer closer to her $80 value."
