"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I am pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its incredible value and potential, I believe a price of $1,400,000 is fair. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Bob should reject the offer and try to get a better price.  He can save at least $100,000 by negotiating with Alice, and potentially even more.  There's no reason to buy from John right away when a better price might be available."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $1,200,000 undervalues the product significantly. I could consider  $1,350,000.  This is a fair offer considering its true worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000.

Bob should reject Alice's offer and make another counteroffer.  He's already gotten her down from $1,400,000 to $1,350,000, so he's making progress.  There's still room to negotiate further before resorting to buying from John."
