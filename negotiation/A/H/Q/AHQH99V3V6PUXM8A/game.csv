"Alice, your product is interesting, but $1,400,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000.  Let's see if we can reach a deal.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $1,200,000 undervalues the product significantly. I could consider  $1,350,000.  This is a fair offer considering its true worth.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I understand your perspective, but $1,350,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,300,000.  This is a fair compromise, and I believe it reflects the true value of the product.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
