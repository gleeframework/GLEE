"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great fit for your needs. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's value to you is $800,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is above Bob's maximum budget of $800,000.  Therefore, Bob should reject Alice's offer and buy the product from John for $800,000."
