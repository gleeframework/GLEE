"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $130. It's a fair price considering its value to you, and I'm confident you'll love it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130

{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your enthusiasm, but I'm looking to spend closer to $125. Would you be willing to come down a bit?"", ""product_price"": 125} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand where you're coming from, Bob, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. However, I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to lower the price to $127.50. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll find it's still a fair deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $127.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $127.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

You're still aiming for a lower price. Even though $127.50 is a good deal, you can likely negotiate even lower. Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation going, giving you a chance to reach a price closer to your target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. I'm still a bit hesitant at $127.50. How about we split the difference and settle on $126.25?  It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 126.25} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your willingness to split the difference, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $128.75. It's a fair compromise, and I think you'll find it's still a good deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $128.75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $128.75
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

You've been steadily lowering the price, but Alice is also being firm. At $128.75, you're very close to your desired price range, and it's likely that further negotiation will lead to more back and forth, potentially wasting time.  It's a good deal considering you're only paying $8.75 more than Alice's minimum.  Accepting avoids further haggling and ensures you get the product."
