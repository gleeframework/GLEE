"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a unique opportunity for you to acquire something worth a million to you, and I'm sure we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product to you, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the price of $1,100,000. Would you consider lowering the price to $950,000? I believe this would be closer to a fair valuation for both of us.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your willingness to negotiate. While your offer of $950,000 is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable threshold. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This price reflects the product's inherent value and allows for a mutually profitable transaction.  Let's work together to reach a final agreement.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for your response. I've considered your offer carefully, and while I understand the value of the product, I am still not able to meet the price of $1,050,000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,000,000, which I believe is a fair compromise considering the product's value to me. I hope this aligns better with your expectations and allows us to reach an agreement.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
