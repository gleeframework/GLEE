Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product to you, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the price of $1,100,000. Would you consider lowering the price to $950,000? I believe this would be closer to a fair valuation for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your response. I've considered your offer carefully, and while I understand the value of the product, I am still not able to meet the price of $1,050,000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,000,000, which I believe is a fair compromise considering the product's value to me. I hope this aligns better with your expectations and allows us to reach an agreement.
