"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500.  It's a great deal for you, and it's a good starting point for us.  Let me know what you think!",11500.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,500. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $10,500 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,000, which is still a great price for the value you'll get.  Let's meet in the middle and see if we can make this work.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above $11,000. I'd be willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll offer $10,750. I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",10750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,750 still isn't quite enough. How about we split the difference again and go with $10,875? I'm really trying to make this work, and I think this offer is fair for both of us.",10875.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still a bit above $10,750. I'm willing to go up to $10,800, but no further. I'm hoping we can meet at this price and finalize the deal.",10800.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand we're getting closer.  I'm willing to go down to $10,900, which is a significant compromise on my part. I believe this offer is a fair compromise, and I hope we can finally reach an agreement.",10900.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above $10,800. I'm willing to meet you at $10,850, but that's as high as I can go. I'm hoping we can finally agree on a price.",10850.0,Bob,8,
