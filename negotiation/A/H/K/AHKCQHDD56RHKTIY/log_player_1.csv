Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a steal at $149. It's a great deal, let me know if you're interested!"",
""product_price"": 149
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $150, I want to see if Bob will pay even slightly less.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting high but slightly below John's offer allows room for Bob to potentially negotiate down a little, still getting me a price higher than $150. 
* **Urgency:**  Phrases like ""for a steal"" and ""great deal"" might entice Bob to make a quicker decision."
