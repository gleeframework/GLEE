"Thank you for your initial offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit overpriced. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's worth to me.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,200,000 is significantly below its market value.  I'm willing to be flexible, but I need a price that reflects the product's true potential. How about we meet in the middle at $1,400,000?",1400000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for the counteroffer, Alice. I understand your perspective, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. How about we try $1,280,000?",1280000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but $1,280,000 is still cutting it too close. Let's settle at $1,340,000. This price reflects the value while recognizing your willingness to negotiate.",1340000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down, Alice, but $1,340,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again. How about we try $1,320,000?",1320000.0,Bob,6,
