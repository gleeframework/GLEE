Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 95}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's higher than your minimum acceptable price of $80, but leaves some room for negotiation.  It also reflects the fact that the product is worth more to Bob, giving him an incentive to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $85 is better than selling to John, it's still lower than my ideal price. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob to see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
``` 

I'm willing to compromise a bit further, but I'm still holding out for a price closer to my initial offer.  This counteroffer should be appealing to Bob since it's closer to his offer than my last one."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $82. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $82
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is only $2 less than what John is willing to pay.  Since I'm not sure I can get a better offer from Bob, I'll accept his offer and sell the product for $82."
