"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I believe a starting price of $1,400,000 is fair. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is higher than the product's worth to her ($1,200,000) but still lower than your maximum budget ($1,500,000). This means there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the initial offer gives you the opportunity to propose a lower price and potentially save money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I'm interested, I'm not sure I can justify that price right now.  I'd be willing to pay $1,300,000, which is still a great deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1300000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest, Bob.  While your offer is tempting, I believe the true value of the product is closer to my initial price. Would you consider $1,350,000?  It's a compromise that reflects the significant benefit you'll gain. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,350,000 is still within my budget and represents a good compromise.  Accepting this offer will allow me to secure the product at a price lower than John's offer.  It also leaves a bit of room for Alice to make a profit, which could encourage her to be more willing to negotiate in the future."
