Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm interested in your product, but $14,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $12,500 for it. Can you consider this offer?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

I will reject Bob's offer. I can get a slightly better price from John, and I think I can get a better offer from Bob if I counter."

``` 
I will accept Bob's offer.  $13,000 is a good price, considering John is only willing to pay $12,000.  There's no guarantee that I can get a better offer from Bob in the next round, and it's getting closer to my minimum acceptable price."
