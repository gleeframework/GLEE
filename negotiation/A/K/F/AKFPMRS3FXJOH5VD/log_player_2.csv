"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is far too high.  It's above your maximum budget and leaves little room for negotiation.  It's best to reject the offer and see if Alice is willing to come down in price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your initial offer is a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product, which is still a good deal for you considering your value.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial price, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate.  It's also within your budget, but still leaves room for potential compromise.  This should encourage Alice to consider your offer seriously."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,200,000 is unfortunately below what I can accept.  I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000, which is still a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product.  Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above my maximum budget.  It's worth seeing if I can push her down further with another counteroffer.  There's still room for negotiation before I have to consider buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $1,600,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000, which is a fair compromise given the value of the product.  Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer shows that I'm serious about buying the product but I'm not willing to overpay.  It's a significant step down from Alice's offer and still leaves room for negotiation. Hopefully, this will encourage her to meet me halfway."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $1,400,000 is getting closer, but I'm still not quite there.  I'm willing to come down to $1,550,000. This is a significant concession on my part, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the value you'll gain from the product.  Let's try to finalize this deal - I'm ready to make this happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,550,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is coming down in price, but $1,550,000 is still above my maximum budget.  I'm going to counteroffer one more time to try and push her down further before considering buying from John. There's still room for negotiation, and I want to see if we can reach a mutually acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further.  While $1,550,000 is closer, I'm still aiming for a price within my budget. I'm willing to offer $1,500,000 for the product.  This is a fair price given the value and our ongoing negotiations.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a final push to reach a price within my budget. It's a significant step closer to Alice's last offer, and hopefully, she will see that it's a reasonable compromise. This offer is also my maximum limit, so if Alice rejects it, I'll have to consider buying from John."
