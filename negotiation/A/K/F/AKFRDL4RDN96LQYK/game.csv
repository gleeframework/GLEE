"I'm still very interested in the product, but I think $825000 is the maximum I'm willing to pay. I'd like to make a final offer, so I'm sticking with my previous offer of $825000. Can you accept it or not?",825000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that $825000 is your final offer, Bob, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make one last offer to try to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $900000. It's the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great deal for you.",900000.0,Alice,7,
