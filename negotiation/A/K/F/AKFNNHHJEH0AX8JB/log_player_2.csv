"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you a unique opportunity to acquire a valuable product that I believe would be a great asset to your business. I'm confident that this product is worth at least $1200000 to me, and I'm willing to let it go for a very competitive price.  I understand you may have your own valuations, so I'm offering it to you for $1500000. This price allows for some wiggle room and reflects the potential value I see in your hands.  Let me know if you're interested in discussing this further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000.
