Given its incredible value and potential, I'm proposing an initial price of $2,250,000. I'm confident that this is a fair starting point for our discussion. What are your thoughts?"",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. This product is good, but not quite that good. I'd be willing to pay $1,125,000.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,125,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I understand your perspective, that offer is significantly below the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down to $1,950,000. This reflects the product's unique nature and potential for a significant return on investment. What do you say?"",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but that's still more than I'm looking to spend.  How about we meet in the middle somewhere? I'm willing to go up to $1,300,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** We are still significantly above John's offer. Bob is showing willingness to move towards a middle ground.  There's room for negotiation, and I want to see if we can get closer to $1,500,000 before accepting or going to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're right, meeting in the middle seems fair. To show you I'm serious about getting this done, let's make it $1,725,000. This price reflects the value while acknowledging your willingness to negotiate."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, it seems like we're getting closer. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,400,000 to try and find a solution that works for both of us.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob's offer is now very close to John's guaranteed offer, and significantly above our minimum. Continuing to push for a higher price carries the risk of Bob reducing his offer or walking away. Accepting secures a good deal and avoids potentially missing out on a sale altogether."
