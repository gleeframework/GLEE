Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $11,500. I believe it holds significant value for you, and this price reflects its worth while still being a fair offer."", 
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($12,000) as possible without scaring him off. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  While $11,500 is a strong starting point, there's a chance Bob might try to negotiate down. This leaves us some wiggle room to still get a price higher than John's offer.
* **Confident Tone:**  The message conveys the product's value and presents the price as fair, increasing the likelihood of acceptance."
