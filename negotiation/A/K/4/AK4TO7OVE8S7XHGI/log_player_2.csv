# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  You're aiming to save as much as possible, and $1,150,000 is still significantly above your target of $1,200,000.
* **Negotiation is necessary.** There's room for negotiation since Alice values the product at $1,000,000.
* **John's price is the safety net.** While you want to save more, John's offer provides a guaranteed purchase option if negotiations fail."

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. In light of this, I am prepared to consider a price closer to your proposal. Therefore, I am extending a counteroffer of $1100000 for the product. This still maintains a reasonable profit margin for us while acknowledging your budget constraints. I hope this revised offer is more in line with what you are considering. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high.** While it's closer to your target, you're still paying $100,000 more than your goal. 
* **Negotiation is still viable.**  Alice is clearly willing to negotiate, and you have room to push for a lower price.
* **John's offer is your backup.**  It's important to keep John's offer in mind in case negotiations with Alice break down.

You should counteroffer Alice again, aiming for a price closer to your budget."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

* **Alice is getting closer.**  Her offer is now only $90,000 above your goal. 
* **You're still within negotiation range.**  You can likely get a price even closer to your goal.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is very close.** Her offer is only $85,000 above your target.

* **John's offer is your fallback.**  It's important to remember that you have a guaranteed option to buy from John.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is very close to your goal.**  You're only paying $14,000 more than your target. 
* **You have only one round left.**  If you reject this offer, you'll be forced to buy from John at a higher price.
* **This is a reasonable compromise.**  While you could try to push for a lower price, there's no guarantee Alice will accept, and you risk losing the deal entirely.

It's better to accept Alice's offer and secure the product at a price that's still within your budget."
