{""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

I'm starting with an offer of $900,000. This is a good starting point because it's above my minimum value but still leaves room for negotiation. I'm hoping to maximize my profit, but I'm also aware that Bob has a strong incentive to buy this product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $850,000 is closer to my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price. I'm going to make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 875000}

I'm counteroffering with $875,000. This is a compromise, but it's still closer to my initial offer and above my minimum. I'm hoping Bob will see the value in the product and be willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000.

Bob is firm on his price of $850,000. While I would prefer to get closer to my initial offer, it's not worth risking the deal and ending up with nothing. I'm going to accept his offer and secure the sale for $850,000."
