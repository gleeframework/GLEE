Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm willing to part with it for $1,100,000."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** You know Bob values the product at $1,200,000.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $1,000,000 (your guaranteed offer from John).
* **Maximizing Profit:**  Offering the product at $1,100,000 allows you to capture a significant portion of the value difference while still ensuring Bob sees a $100,000 gain from purchasing.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between a price attractive to Bob and maximizing your profit."
