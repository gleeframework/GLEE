Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and your counteroffer. However, $800,000 significantly undervalues the true worth of this product and its potential. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This is a significant concession, reflecting my eagerness to find a mutually beneficial deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you moving closer to a feasible price point.  While $1,200,000 isn't ideal, I'm willing to consider offers closer to $1,600,000. I believe this reflects the product's true value and offers a fair deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
