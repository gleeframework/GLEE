"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you a chance to be the first to own this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm initially offering it at $2,300,000. I'm confident this is a fair starting point for negotiations."",
""product_price"": 2300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Anchor:** Starting with a price significantly higher than your minimum ($2,300,000 vs. $1,500,000) sets a strong anchor. This might make Bob perceive subsequent offers as more reasonable, even if they are still above his valuation. 
* **Justification:** Mentioning the product's ""potential"" provides a vague but plausible reason for the high price without revealing your true bottom line.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  Clearly stating this is a ""starting point"" signals your willingness to negotiate and invites a counteroffer from Bob.

By starting high, you give yourself room to negotiate down while still aiming for a price well above both Bob's valuation and your guaranteed offer from John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your initial offer is way above my budget. I'm interested in this product, but I can't go higher than $800,000. This is my best and final offer.  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than both your minimum and your starting offer. Accepting would mean a substantial loss. While his message sounds firm, there's still room for negotiation. You have the security of John's offer, so it's worth continuing the negotiation to explore if Bob will move closer to your range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and your counteroffer. However, $800,000 significantly undervalues the true worth of this product and its potential. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This is a significant concession, reflecting my eagerness to find a mutually beneficial deal."",
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Rejection Justification:** You acknowledge Bob's offer but firmly state that it's too low, emphasizing the product's value.
* **Significant but Not Drastic Reduction:** You drop your price by $400,000, a substantial move that might signal willingness to negotiate further without giving away too much too soon.
* **""Mutually Beneficial"":**  This phrasing aims to keep the tone positive and suggests you are looking for a win-win, even though your offer is still significantly above Bob's stated limit. 

You are still significantly above Bob's valuation, but this counteroffer tests his resolve and allows you to gauge his willingness to move closer to your range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price, but $1,900,000 is still out of my range. I'm willing to go up to $1,200,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer has increased significantly to $1,200,000, but it's still below your guaranteed sale price with John ($1,500,000). While his offer is getting closer to your acceptable range, there's still potential to negotiate a better deal. You have six rounds left, and Bob's willingness to move suggests he's motivated."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you moving closer to a feasible price point.  While $1,200,000 isn't ideal, I'm willing to consider offers closer to $1,600,000. I believe this reflects the product's true value and offers a fair deal for both of us."",
""product_price"": 1600000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledgement and Encouragement:** You acknowledge Bob's movement and use positive reinforcement to encourage further negotiation.
* **Strategic Positioning:** Your counteroffer ($1,600,000) is a strategic point: 
    *  Above your safety net ($1,500,000 from John).
    *  Significantly below your previous offer, signaling flexibility.
    *  Leaves room for Bob to counter, ideally above $1,500,000.

You're aiming to guide Bob closer to your desired range without revealing your absolute bottom line.  This approach keeps the negotiation active while ensuring you can still walk away with a profit if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $1,600,000 is still beyond what I can reasonably afford.  I'm firm on my previous offer of $1,200,000.  If you're not willing to meet me there, I'll have to look at other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has now repeated his $1,200,000 offer twice while stating it's his ""firm"" price.  His language about looking at ""other options"" suggests he might be trying to pressure you, but you have a strong alternative. 

* **Risk vs. Reward:** Continuing negotiations with Bob carries the risk of him not budging further. You could potentially lose the guaranteed $1,500,000 from John if the negotiation drags on.
* **Strong Alternative:** John's offer provides a safe and profitable way out. Accepting John's offer eliminates the risk of ending up with a less favorable outcome.

While there's a slight chance Bob might come up further, the current situation suggests it's not worth jeopardizing a guaranteed $1,500,000."
