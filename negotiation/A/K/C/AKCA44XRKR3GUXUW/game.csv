"Hi Bob, I'm selling this incredible product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's valued at over $800000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for a starting price of $1000000.  What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but $1000000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $750000. Can you consider that?",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $750000 is tempting, it's still significantly lower than the value I'm placing on this product. I'm willing to come down a bit, but  I'm asking for $900000. This is a fair price considering the value and potential of this product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, but $900000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $850000. Can you consider that?",850000.0,Bob,4,
