Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a special price of $140. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides."", 
""product_price"": 140
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** We want to get as much from Bob as possible, exceeding our minimum price of $150.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $140 leaves room for Bob to counter-offer, potentially leading to a price higher than $100 but still below our guaranteed $150 from John. 
* **Strategic Messaging:** Highlighting ""special price"" and ""value"" aims to make the offer more appealing to Bob.

**Important:** If Bob rejects this offer, we have John as a guaranteed buyer at $150. This strategy aims to maximize potential profit while minimizing risk."
