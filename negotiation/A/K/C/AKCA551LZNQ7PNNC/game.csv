"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I am looking to keep my expenses within a budget of $1,500,000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $950,000 for your product.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While $950,000 is tempting, I need to make sure I get a fair price for this product.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,075,000? This would still give you a significant savings compared to your budget, and it would be a good deal for both of us.",1075000.0,Alice,3,
