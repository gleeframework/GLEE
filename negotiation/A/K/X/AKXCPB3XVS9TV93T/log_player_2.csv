**Reasoning:**

While Alice is holding firm at $725,000 and called it her final offer, it's the best price we've gotten so far and is significantly lower than her starting price.  It's also lower than John's offer of $800,000.  Continuing to negotiate at this point has a higher risk of Alice walking away, forcing us to buy from John at a higher price."
