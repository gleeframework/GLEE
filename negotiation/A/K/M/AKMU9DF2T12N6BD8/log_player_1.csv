Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $11,500. I believe it holds significant value for you, and this price reflects a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to Bob's $12,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting with $11,500 leaves room for Bob to potentially counter-offer, while still ensuring a significant profit for Alice if he accepts.
* **Consider the Alternative:** Alice has a guaranteed sale at $10,000 from John. The offer to Bob needs to be enticing enough to beat that.

By offering a price slightly below Bob's perceived value, Alice increases the likelihood of a successful sale while aiming for the highest possible profit."
