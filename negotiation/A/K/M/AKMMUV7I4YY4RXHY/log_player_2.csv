Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I think there's been a mistake! I chose to reject Alice's offer and consider buying from John, but I didn't make a counteroffer. Let me correct that.

Since I've already decided to consider buying from John, I'll make one last counteroffer to Alice, but I'll make it a lowball offer to see if she'll accept it.
