Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm very interested in the product, but $1,800,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for it.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. While $1,800,000 represents its full value, I'm willing to come down to $1,450,000 to find a mutually beneficial agreement. This is a significant price reduction and reflects my eagerness to work with you."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,450,000 is still above my budget. Let's split the difference - I'm offering $1,125,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us both to come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,125,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is steadily increasing his offer, indicating he's motivated. While John offers a guaranteed $1,200,000, there's still room to negotiate a better deal with Bob before settling for John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I see you're serious about this product and I respect your approach to this negotiation.  Let's settle this â€“ I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise that reflects the product's value."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you getting closer to my budget. However, $1,300,000 is still more than I can afford. I'm willing to go up to $1,200,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**  Bob has met your minimum acceptable price. There's no guarantee you can negotiate a higher price with him, and John's offer provides the same amount. It's best to take the sure thing and accept Bob's offer."
