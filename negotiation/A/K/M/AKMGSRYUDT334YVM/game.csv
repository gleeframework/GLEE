"Thanks for the offer Alice, but $120 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $90 for it. What do you think?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $90. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $105. What do you think?",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the compromise Alice, but $105 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. How about $100? I'm sure we can both be happy with that.",100.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $100. I'm willing to give you a slight discount, but I think $110 is the lowest I can go. What do you think?",110.0,Alice,5,
