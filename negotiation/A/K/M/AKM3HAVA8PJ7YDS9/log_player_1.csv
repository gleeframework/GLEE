Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

This offer is slightly higher than Bob's valuation of $800,000, but still lower than John's valuation of $1,000,000. This leaves room for Bob to feel like he's getting a good deal, while still ensuring a profit for you.  

Let's analyze why this is a good strategy:

* **Maximize Profit:**  Even if Bob rejects the offer, you're guaranteed $1,000,000 from John. 
* **Potential for Higher Gain:**  There's a chance Bob might accept the offer, earning you $950,000. 
* **Motivating Factor:**  By offering a price slightly above Bob's perceived value, you're giving him a reason to consider your offer.

Remember, there's no guarantee Bob will accept. But this offer strikes a balance between maximizing your potential profit and ensuring a secure fallback option."
