Round 2
Bob's offer:

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for working with me. That last offer was closer, but I need to be realistic with my budget. Would you consider $1,425,000? I think that's a fair offer considering the market value.

You have three options:

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is slowly increasing his offer, he's still significantly below my minimum. At this point, the potential gains from continuing to negotiate with Bob are outweighed by the guaranteed $1,500,000 from John. It's time to cut my losses and take the sure thing."
