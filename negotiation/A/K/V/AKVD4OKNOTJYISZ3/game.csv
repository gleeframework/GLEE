"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a fair offer. I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000 for the product.",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but that price is a little high for me. Could you do $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $1,100,000 might be a bit steep for you. I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $1,050,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair compromise.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. I'm getting closer, but $1,050,000 is still a stretch for my budget. How about $950,000?  That's a significant move on my part.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. However, $950,000 is still a bit below my target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I'm counteroffering at $1,025,000. This is the best I can do, and I think it's a fair compromise.",1025000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, you're tough! I do value this product and I'm willing to keep talking. How about  $980,000? I'm really trying to make this work.",980000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your enthusiasm and willingness to negotiate. However, $980,000 is still a bit below my target price. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm counteroffering at $1,030,000. This is the best I can do, and I think it's a fair compromise.",1030000.0,Alice,7,
