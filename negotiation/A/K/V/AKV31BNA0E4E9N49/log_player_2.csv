# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am delighted to present you with our premium product, which I believe would greatly benefit you. Given its value to you, I understand it's worth $12,000. To make this opportunity accessible, I am offering it to you at an exclusive price of $10,000. This is a special offer tailored to appreciate your interest and commitment to the product. Please let me know if you are interested in proceeding with this offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly starting high. She knows your maximum is $12,000 and is trying to anchor you to that price. By rejecting her initial offer, we might be able to negotiate a better deal, closer to John's $12,000 price."
