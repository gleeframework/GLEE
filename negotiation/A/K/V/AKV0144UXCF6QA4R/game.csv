"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $20000. This is a great opportunity to get your hands on something truly unique and valuable. What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but I'm not sure I can justify spending $20000 on this product. I was thinking more along the lines of $10000. I'm still interested in the product, but I need to be mindful of my budget. Can you meet me at $10000?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $10000 is a bit of a stretch for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $17000. This is still a great deal, and I think you'll find the product is worth every penny. What do you think?",17000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $17000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm thinking more along the lines of $12000. I'd love to get this product, but I really need to be at or below my budget. Can you consider meeting me at $12000?",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $12000 is still a bit lower than I'd like, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm thinking of a price of $14000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great deal for you. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to make concessions, but $14000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to walk away and buy the product from John for $12000 if we can't meet in the middle. Can you really meet me at $12000?",12000.0,Bob,6,
