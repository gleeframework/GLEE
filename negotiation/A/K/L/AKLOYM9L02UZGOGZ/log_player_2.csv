"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which has been valued at $100 by myself. Considering its quality and the benefits it provides, I believe it's worth more than what you're willing to pay. However, I'm willing to negotiate. How about we aim for a price closer to $90? I think this would be fair for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json

``` 

Alice's offer of $90 is still above your maximum budget. By rejecting her offer, you can proceed to buy from John at your desired price of $80."
