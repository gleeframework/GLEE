"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which has been valued at $100 by myself. Considering its quality and the benefits it provides, I believe it's worth more than what you're willing to pay. However, I'm willing to negotiate. How about we aim for a price closer to $90? I think this would be fair for both of us.",90.0,Alice,1,
