"Alice, that's a good start. I'm interested in this product, but $1,200,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for it. What do you think?",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell it to you for $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the market demand.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
