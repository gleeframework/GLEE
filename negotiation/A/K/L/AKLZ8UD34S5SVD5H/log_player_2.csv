Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell it to you for $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the market demand. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

$1,100,000 is a good price. It's a significant saving compared to John's offer, and it's within my budget. Let's seal the deal."
