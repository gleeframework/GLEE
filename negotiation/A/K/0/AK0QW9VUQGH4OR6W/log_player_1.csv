Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I know you'll be interested in. I'm asking for $10,000 for it, which is a great deal considering its value. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than my minimum but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Appealing to Bob's value:** I highlight the product's value to him to make the offer seem more enticing.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** This price gives Bob some space to counteroffer, allowing for a back-and-forth discussion. 
* **Potential for a good deal:**  I believe that $10,000 is a fair starting point that balances my desire for a high profit with the chance of a successful negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,000. Would you be willing to consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price of $8,000. While I'm open to negotiation, I'm not willing to settle for a price that significantly undervalues the product for me.  I'll counteroffer with a price closer to my desired range, hoping to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $7,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to come down to $8,500. This is still a fair price considering the product's value to you.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a reasonable price:** $8,500 is still higher than Bob's offer but closer to his range, showing I'm willing to negotiate.
* **Highlight value:** Again, I emphasize the product's value to him to justify my price.
* **Call for agreement:**  I invite him to negotiate further and reach a mutually beneficial price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $8,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to pay $7,500 for the product. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $7,500 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $8,000.  While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm not willing to continue going back and forth with Bob if it means selling the product for less than what John is offering.  Selling to John guarantees me a price that meets my minimum requirements, making it the most sensible choice in this situation."
