"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a price of $12,000. This is a significant discount from my minimum value of $15,000, but it's still above Bob's perceived value of $8,000. This gives Bob some room to negotiate while ensuring I have a good starting point. It also leaves room for me to lower the price if necessary in subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $9,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum value of $15,000. I'm willing to negotiate further and see if I can get closer to my desired price. I have 8 more rounds to make a deal with Bob before resorting to selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm countering Bob's offer with $10,500. This is a compromise that is halfway between my previous offer of $12,000 and Bob's offer of $9,000. This shows Bob I'm willing to negotiate but still value the product significantly more than him. It also leaves some room for further negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $9,500 is getting closer to my desired price, it's still far from my minimum value of $15,000.  I have 6 rounds left to negotiate with Bob and I believe I can get a better price. It's still more attractive to me than selling to John immediately for $15,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm countering Bob's offer with $10,000. This is a further compromise, demonstrating my willingness to meet him halfway while still keeping the price above my minimum acceptable value. This leaves some room for potential agreement in the remaining rounds, and I'm hopeful that Bob will see the value in this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum value, it's still not enough. I believe there's still room for negotiation, and I have 4 rounds left to get a better price. Selling to John for $15,000 is always an option, but I'm still hoping to reach a mutually agreeable deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9750} 
```

**Explanation:**

I'm countering Bob's offer with $9,750. This is a slight compromise from my previous offer of $10,000, demonstrating that I'm willing to negotiate. It also leaves a small window for Bob to counter if he wishes, which could potentially lead to a deal. With only 3 rounds left, I need to start closing the gap to avoid selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,300. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,300
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is getting close to my minimum value of $15,000, I'm still hesitant to accept. There's still room for negotiation, and I have two rounds left. It's risky to sell to John at this point, as I'm confident I can get a higher price from Bob. I'll continue to negotiate with him."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 9
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm countering Bob's offer with $9,500. This is a small concession from my previous offer of $9,750, demonstrating that I'm willing to negotiate and close the deal.  With only one round left, I need to make a final push to get a deal with Bob. Selling to John is still an option, but I'm hoping to get a price closer to my minimum value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer 
(2) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

With only one round left, Bob's offer of $9,250 is still below my minimum value. While I'm disappointed that I couldn't reach a deal with Bob, I'm not willing to settle for a price that's significantly lower than my minimum. Selling to John for $15,000 is the best option to maximize my earnings at this point."
