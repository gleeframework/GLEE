{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $850,000.  It's a valuable piece, and I believe this price reflects its worth.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 850000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price slightly higher than the product's value to Bob. This leaves room for negotiation while still securing a good profit for Alice."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  I'm very interested in the product, and I'd be happy to pay $750,000.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Alice should reject Bob's offer. While $750,000 is a decent price, it's still below her minimum of $800,000.  She has the option of counter-offering to potentially secure a better price or selling to John for her minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but I can't go as low as $750,000.  The product is truly worth more than that.  How about we meet in the middle at $800,000?  That's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 800000}
