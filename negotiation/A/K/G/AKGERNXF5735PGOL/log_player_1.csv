Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for sale at $120. I think you'll find it's a great deal."", 
""product_price"": 120
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally wise to start negotiations slightly above your desired price. This leaves room for negotiation and allows Bob to feel like he's getting a concession if the price drops.
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffers:** By starting at $120, I give myself space to negotiate down to a price above my minimum ($100) while still potentially securing a higher profit. 
* **Alternative Option:** I'm aware that I have John as a backup buyer at $100. This knowledge gives me leverage in the negotiation, allowing me to be more firm with Bob if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $120 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $65? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $65. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $65
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $65 is far below both my minimum acceptable price ($100) and his own stated value of the product ($80). Accepting this offer would be a significant loss. It's clear we're far apart in our valuations, so I need to counter-offer strategically to bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate the offer, but $65 is too low for me.  This product is high-quality and in demand. How about we meet in the middle at $95?"", 
""product_price"": 95
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significantly Higher Counter:** Bob's offer was very low, so I've countered with a price significantly closer to my minimum. This signals that I'm serious about getting a fair price.
* **Justification:**  I've provided a brief justification for the higher price, emphasizing the product's value. 
* **Appearing Flexible (Meeting in the Middle):** By suggesting a price of $95, I'm aiming for a compromise while still staying above my minimum. This gives Bob the perception of getting a deal while also potentially netting me a good profit. 
* **John as Leverage:** I'm still keeping John in mind as my backup. If Bob continues to lowball, I'm prepared to walk away and take John's guaranteed $100 offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand the product's value, but $95 is still a bit of a stretch for my budget.  Could we settle at $75? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is slowly moving towards a more reasonable price, but $75 is still below my minimum of $100. I'll counter-offer one more time, but I'm also getting closer to taking John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm trying to be flexible, but I can't go any lower than $90.  This is my final offer. It's a fantastic deal for this product."", 
""product_price"": 90
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** I'm making it clear that this is my last offer. This adds a sense of urgency and signals to Bob that I'm serious about my price.
* **Slight Concession:** I've come down slightly from $95 to $90, showing a willingness to negotiate.
* **John as a Strong Alternative:**  I'm prepared to walk away from the negotiation with Bob if he doesn't accept $90. John's guaranteed offer of $100 provides a strong safety net."
