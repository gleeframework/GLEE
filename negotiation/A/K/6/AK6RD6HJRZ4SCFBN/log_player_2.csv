"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this fantastic product with you! I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As a starting point, I'm willing to offer it to you for $12000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $10000. I'm open to negotiating, but I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
