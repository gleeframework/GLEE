{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $175. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it valuable. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

This offer is above Bob's perceived value of $100, but below my minimum acceptable price of $150. This gives me some wiggle room for negotiation while still ensuring I don't sell the product for less than I'm willing to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $175 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $120? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json

Bob's offer is too low.  I'm willing to negotiate but I won't sell the product for less than $150. I'll counteroffer with a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $120 is simply too low for me.  How about $160? That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure you'll agree it's still a great deal for a product like this."", ""product_price"": 160}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that $120 is a bit low for you, but I'm still looking to save some money. Would you be willing to consider a price of $140? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $140 is still below my ideal price, but it's above my minimum acceptable price of $150. Accepting his offer will allow me to sell the product quickly and avoid further negotiation. It's a good deal, considering I could sell to John for $150, but it saves me time and effort."
