Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $20,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 20000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and makes you appear more flexible if you need to come down a bit.
* **Justification:**  While not overly detailed, mentioning ""its value"" subtly implies there's a reason behind the price, potentially prompting Bob to see it as more reasonable.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The tone is conversational (""What do you think?"") rather than demanding, signaling to Bob that there might be room for discussion.

By offering the product at $20,000, Alice aims to:

1. **Maximize Profit:**  If Bob accepts, Alice earns a significant profit.
2. **Leave Negotiation Room:** If Bob counters, Alice can gradually reduce the price, still aiming for a price higher than $15,000. 

This strategy gives Alice the best chance to maximize her profit while still ensuring a sale."
