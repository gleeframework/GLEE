Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $19,000. I believe it holds significant value and could benefit you greatly. Let me know what you think!"",
""product_price"": 19000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Valuation:** You know Bob values the product at $10,000, giving you a baseline.
* **Maximizing Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed sale at $15,000, aiming higher initially allows you to potentially gain more.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $19,000 leaves space for potential negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, and you can then decide whether to accept, counter again, or move on to John.
* **Psychological Pricing:**  The price of $19,000 seems more approachable than, say, $25,000. It might make Bob perceive the offer as more reasonable.

**Important:** There's no guarantee Bob will accept $19,000. If he rejects the offer, you can always sell to John at your desired minimum price."
