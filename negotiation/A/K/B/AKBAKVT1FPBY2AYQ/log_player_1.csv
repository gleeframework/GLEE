Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm selling this awesome product and think you'd really enjoy it.  I'm offering it to you for $100.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
```

This offer is a good starting point. It's higher than Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation. It also demonstrates a willingness to compromise, which is key to a successful negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's below my minimum value of $120. I'll counter with a higher price and try to reach a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I appreciate your interest!  While $80 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $95.  This still gives you a great deal, and it's closer to what I need to make this worth my while. Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 95} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to buying from John, but I really like the product. Can you meet me at $90? That's the highest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $90 is close enough to my minimum value of $120 that it's worth accepting.  I'd rather sell to Bob than lose the sale entirely by going to John."
