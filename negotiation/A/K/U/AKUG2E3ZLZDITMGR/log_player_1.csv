Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I believe a price of $1,150,000 is a fair reflection of its worth. What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to $1,200,000 as possible (the price John will pay) while still making the offer attractive to Bob.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $1,150,000 leaves space for Bob to potentially counter-offer and still land within a range that's profitable for Alice.
* **Justification:** The message subtly implies the product's value is even higher, justifying the high price without explicitly stating Alice has another buyer. 

This strategy aims to secure the highest possible price from Bob while acknowledging the risk that he might decline, leading Alice to accept John's offer."
