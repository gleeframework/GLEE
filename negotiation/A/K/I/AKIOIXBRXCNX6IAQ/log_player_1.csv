I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This is a good starting point because it leaves room for negotiation while still being a significant profit for me. I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium for the product. If not, I can always negotiate lower, or take the guaranteed $12,000 from John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $13,000 is a good offer, it's still less than my target. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to push for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

I'm going to counter with $14,000. This is a compromise, but it's still above Bob's offer and closer to my desired price. I'm hoping that Bob will see the value in the product and agree to this price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $13,500 is now closer to my desired price and a better deal than selling to John for $12,000.  I'll accept his offer."
