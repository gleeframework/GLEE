"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we discuss the price, I want to start with an offer of $950000. This is a competitive price considering the product's worth to you is $800000. I'm willing to make a concession to get this deal done, but I'm not willing to go below $900000. What are your thoughts?",950000.0,Alice,1,

Considering the product's value to me is $1000000, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm counteroffering at $925000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I hope we can meet in the middle.
