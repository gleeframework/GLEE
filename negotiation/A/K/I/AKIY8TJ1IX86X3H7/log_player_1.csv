Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your BATNA (Best Alternative to a Negotiated Agreement):** You have a strong BATNA because you have John willing to pay your full asking price of $1,500,000. This gives you significant leverage.
* **Bob's Valuation:** The product is worth less to Bob ($1,200,000) than it is to you. 
* **Zone of Possible Agreement (ZOPA):**  The ZOPA exists between $1,200,000 (what Bob values it at) and $1,500,000 (your minimum and John's offer).

**Strategy**

You want to aim high, but not price Bob out completely.  Consider these factors:

* **Relationship:** Do you have a prior relationship with Bob? A good relationship might make him more open to a slightly higher price.
* **Bob's Potential for Future Business:** If Bob could be a repeat customer, it might be worth a smaller profit margin this time.

**The Offer**

Here's an offer that balances maximizing profit with the risk of losing the sale to Bob:

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be a valuable asset to your business.  I'm offering it to you for $1,450,000."",
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Strong but Justified Price:** $1,450,000 is a strong price that captures most of the value difference between your BATNA and Bob's valuation. 
* **Open to Negotiation (Implied):** While you didn't explicitly state it, leaving room between your offer and your BATNA allows for some negotiation if Bob counters.

**Important Note:**  This is just one possible approach. Gauge Bob's initial reaction and be prepared to adjust your strategy if he pushes back strongly."
