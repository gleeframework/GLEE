"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value of this product, $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'd be willing to pay $850,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm still confident that the product is worth more than $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $875,000. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll find it's still a valuable deal.",875000.0,Alice,3,
