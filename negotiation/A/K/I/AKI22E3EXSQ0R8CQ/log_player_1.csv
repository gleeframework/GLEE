Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1000000} 

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,000,000.  This is ambitious, but I want to see if Bob is truly interested and how high he's willing to go.  If he rejects, I'll adjust my price based on his counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $500,000.

Bob's offer is too low. I'm not willing to sell for that amount. I'll reject his offer and try to get a better price in the next round."

I'm counteroffering at $750,000. This is still above my minimum, but I'm showing some flexibility and acknowledging Bob's interest.  Hopefully, this will lead to a more favorable price for both of us."

Bob's offer is still below my minimum, even though it's getting closer. I'm going to reject this offer and try to push for a better price in the next round."

I'm counteroffering at $650,000.  This is a compromise, and I'm hoping Bob will see the value in finalizing the deal at this price.  I'm getting closer to my minimum, but I'm still not willing to go lower."

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

I've been through several rounds of negotiation with Bob, and while we're getting closer, he's not willing to meet my minimum price. To ensure I don't lose out on a good deal, I'm going to sell the product to John for $800,000. It's not my ideal price, but it's still a significant profit and guarantees a sale."
