,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm interested, but $100 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. How about $85? That's still a good deal for you, and it's within my budget.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $100 might be a bit steep for you. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $85. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $92. It's still a great deal for both of us, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. What do you think?",92.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $92 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $88, which is a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think.",88.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $88 is still a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to give up just yet. I'm willing to meet you at $90. It's the highest I can go, but I think it's a fair price for the product. What do you think?",90.0,Alice,5,
