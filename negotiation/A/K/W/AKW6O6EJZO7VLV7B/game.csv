"Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really like it. I'm asking for $140, which is a fair price considering its value.  Let me know what you think!",140.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $140 is a little steep for me. Would you consider selling it for $100?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $100 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $125.  This is a good deal for both of us, so let's see if we can agree.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  How about $110? That's a fair compromise, don't you think?",110.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $110 is still below what I'm comfortable with. Let's split the difference and go with $115.  I think this is a fair compromise.",115.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, it seems like we're getting close. I'm willing to offer you $112. That's the best I can do.",112.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're making an effort, but $112 still isn't quite there. Let's meet in the middle.  I'll accept $113.  It's a fair price, and it will allow us to close this deal.",113.0,Alice,7,
