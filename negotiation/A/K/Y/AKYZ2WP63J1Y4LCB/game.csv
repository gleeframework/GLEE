"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. With that said, I'm willing to offer it to you for $12000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but $12000 is higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $8500 for it, as that's the maximum I can afford right now. Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $10500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to me.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $10500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go to $9000.  This is a significant compromise for me, and I believe it's fair given the value of the product to both of us.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a compromise, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, $9000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to make another concession and offer the product to you for $11000. This is the highest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to me.",11000.0,Alice,5,
