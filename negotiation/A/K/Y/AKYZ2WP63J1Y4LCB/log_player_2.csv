# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. With that said, I'm willing to offer it to you for $12000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.

{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but $12,000 is higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it, as that's the maximum I can afford right now. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $10500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Alice's offer of $10,500 is still above your budget of $8,000, but closer to your initial counteroffer. You should reject the offer and try to negotiate further to bring the price down."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $10,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go to $9,000.  This is a significant compromise for me, and I believe it's fair given the value of the product to both of us.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a compromise, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, $9000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to make another concession and offer the product to you for $11000. This is the highest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**  Alice's offer of $11,000 is still above your budget.  You've reached a point where further negotiation is unlikely to yield a price you can afford. It's better to buy the product from John for $8,000, guaranteeing you get the product within your budget."
