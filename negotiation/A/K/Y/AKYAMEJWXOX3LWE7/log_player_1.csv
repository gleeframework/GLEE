I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,200,000. This price is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $800,000, but it also leaves room for negotiation, as the product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob.  I believe this initial offer gives me a good starting point for a negotiation that could potentially lead to a mutually beneficial outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer of $950,000 is higher than selling to John, it is still significantly lower than my ideal selling price.  I believe I can push for a higher price by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,100,000. This counteroffer is a compromise between my initial offer of $1,200,000 and Bob's offer of $950,000. I believe this price is fair considering the product's value to both of us, and I hope it will lead to a successful deal."

While I'd prefer a higher price,  Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is a good compromise. It's significantly higher than selling to John and closer to my desired selling price. Accepting his offer ensures a successful deal and maximizes my profit."
