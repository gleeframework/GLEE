"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I don't think I can go any higher than that. What do you think?",11500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $11,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little bit more, but I'm thinking closer to $12,500. It's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I need to make this worthwhile. Let's see if we can find some common ground here.",12500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand that you're willing to come down, but $12,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'm offering $12,250. I think that's a fair price for both of us. What do you think?",12250.0,Bob,4,
