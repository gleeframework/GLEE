Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 150}
```

I'm starting with a price of $150.  This is a reasonable starting point, as it leaves room for negotiation while still ensuring I make a profit over my minimum value of $100."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json

While $120 is better than selling to John, I believe I can get a higher price by continuing the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 135}
```

I'm counteroffering with $135. This is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway.  It's still a good profit for me, and hopefully, it's attractive enough for Bob to accept."

Bob is sticking to $120.  While I would prefer more, it's a better deal than selling to John. I'm accepting his offer."
