"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $130. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $160. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $160 is still a bit too high for me. How about $140? I'm really interested in the product, but my budget is limited.",140.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make another concession. I'll offer it to you for $155. It's the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",155.0,Alice,5,
