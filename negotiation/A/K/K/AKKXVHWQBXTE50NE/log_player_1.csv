Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

This offer is significantly higher than my minimum desired price of $800,000, but it still leaves significant room for negotiation.  I'm starting high because Bob values the product at $1,500,000, so I'm aiming to secure a price closer to the middle ground."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

Bob's offer is too low. While it's above my minimum, I believe I can get a better price.  I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can find a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm lowering my price to $1,000,000. This is still a good deal for me, and hopefully it will be acceptable to Bob. I'm trying to meet him halfway while still securing a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still below what I would ideally like, but it's getting closer to my minimum.  Considering that John is only willing to pay $800,000,  I'm going to accept Bob's offer and sell the product for $850,000."
