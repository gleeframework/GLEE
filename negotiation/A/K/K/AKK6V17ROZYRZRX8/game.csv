"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  However, $120 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  How about $90? ",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concern about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $90. How about we meet in the middle at $110? It's still a great deal for you, and I'm willing to compromise to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $110 is still a bit high for me. Let's try $100.  I think that's a fair price that benefits both of us.",100.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $100. I'm willing to give you a slight discount, but I need to make sure I'm still making a decent profit. How about we meet at $115? It's still a good compromise, and I think you'll be happy with the price.",115.0,Alice,5,
