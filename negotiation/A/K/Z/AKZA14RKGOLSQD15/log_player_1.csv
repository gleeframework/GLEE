"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this amazing product for $10,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll see the value in it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $10,000, which is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $8,000. This gives me room to negotiate downwards.
* **Positive Tone:** The message is friendly and positive to create a good rapport with Bob. 
* **Highlighting Value:**  I emphasize the product's value to encourage Bob to consider it seriously. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** I ask Bob for his thoughts to signal I'm open to negotiation. 

**Next Steps:**

I'll observe Bob's response and adjust my strategy based on his actions. If he counteroffers, I'll aim to reach a price that's both profitable for me and appealing to him.  If he rejects my initial offer, I'll consider offering a slightly lower price in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer Alice! I'm really interested, but $10000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go right now. I'm happy to pay $8000. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Counteroffer:** Bob's offer of $8,000 is my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Time Pressure:**  I'm already in round 2, and I want to avoid wasting time on further negotiation. 
* **John's Offer:** While selling to John for $8,000 is an option, accepting Bob's offer allows me to potentially build a relationship with Bob for future transactions. 

**Outcome:**

Accepting Bob's offer allows me to secure the sale quickly and move on to other opportunities. While I initially aimed for a higher price,  achieving my minimum goal is a solid outcome, and I can use this experience to refine my negotiation strategy in the future."
