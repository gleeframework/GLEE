"I'm really interested in the product, but $140 is a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to pay $130 for it. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",130.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest! While $130 is a good price, I'm hoping to get a little closer to my asking price. Would you be willing to meet me at $135? That's still a great deal for you, and it would allow me to get a bit closer to my goal.",135.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $135. Would you be willing to meet me at $132? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",132.0,Bob,4,
