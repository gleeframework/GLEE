"Alice, thanks for the offer!  While I see the value in this product, $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'd be willing to pay $950,000 for it.  This price reflects a fair value for both of us, allowing you a healthy profit and me a good deal.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is a bit too low for me to consider at this time.  I'm confident this product will bring you a significant return on your investment.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,025,000?",1025000.0,Alice,3,
