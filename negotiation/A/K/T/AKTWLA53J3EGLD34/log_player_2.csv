"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic product that I believe would be incredibly valuable to you. Given its unique features and potential, I'm initially offering it for $1,100,000. I'm confident this represents a fair deal considering the return on investment you'll see. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer!  While I see the value in this product, $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'd be willing to pay $950,000 for it.  This price reflects a fair value for both of us, allowing you a healthy profit and me a good deal."", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is a bit too low for me to consider at this time.  I'm confident this product will bring you a significant return on your investment.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,025,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is now below Bob's initial maximum.**  $1,025,000 is less than Bob's $1,200,000 limit.
* **Further negotiation is risky.** While Bob could potentially get an even lower price, there's a chance Alice will reject further counteroffers and he'll be stuck buying from John at a higher price. 
* **This is a good compromise.**  $1,025,000 is a significant savings compared to John's price, and it's likely a fair price for both parties."
