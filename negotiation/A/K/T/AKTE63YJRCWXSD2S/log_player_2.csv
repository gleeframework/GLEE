"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's not worth accepting Alice's offer at this point.  The goal is to save as much money as possible. Rejecting and making a counteroffer is the best strategy to potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 700000}
``` 

This counteroffer starts the negotiation by offering a price significantly lower than Alice's initial offer. It's a bold move but might encourage Alice to negotiate further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is now at your maximum price. Accepting will save you the time and risk of further negotiation, as the price is already at your limit."
