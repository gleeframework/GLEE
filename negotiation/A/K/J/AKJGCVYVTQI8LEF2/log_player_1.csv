Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $2,250,000. This is a unique item, and I believe this price reflects its true worth. Let me know what you think."", 
""product_price"": 2250000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $1,500,000 (your minimum), you have room to start high. Offering a significantly higher price initially allows for potential negotiation and maximizes your potential profit.
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes the ""value and potential"" of the product, framing the higher price as justified. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** While the initial offer is high, the tone remains open for discussion (""Let me know what you think""). This leaves room for Bob to counter-offer if he's truly interested but finds the price too steep.

**Strategy:**

This approach aims to:

1. **Gauge Bob's Interest:** A very high offer will quickly reveal if Bob is a serious buyer willing to pay a premium.
2. **Maximize Profit:**  If Bob accepts, you've secured a much higher profit.
3. **Leave Room for Negotiation:** If Bob rejects the initial offer, you can always negotiate down, knowing you have John as a backup."
