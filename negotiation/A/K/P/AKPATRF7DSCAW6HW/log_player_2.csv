"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a better deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $100. I can meet you in the middle at $140, which is a fair price considering the product's value to you.

You have three options:

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm still not willing to go as low as $115. I can do $145, which is a bit closer to my minimum price, but I think it's still a good deal for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $145
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

It's clear that Alice is not budging much on price. Her offers are hovering around $140-$145, and with each round, the chance of getting a price you're happy with decreases.  It's better to cut your losses now and secure the product for $120 from John."
