"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,500,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations.",1500000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, but I'm looking to negotiate a better price. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. I believe this is a more balanced price considering the product's value and my budget.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. I'm willing to negotiate, but $1,200,000 is too low for me to consider. I can offer the product to you for $1,400,000. This reflects the true value of the product while still offering you a significant discount from my initial asking price.",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,400,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you in the middle and offer $1,100,000 for the product. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand this is a significant investment. However, $1,100,000 is simply too low for me to accept. To be completely transparent, I have another buyer who's offering me $1,000,000. I'm willing to make one final offer to you: $1,300,000. This is a firm price, and I believe it reflects the true value of the product while still offering you a fair deal. Please consider it carefully.",1300000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand you have another buyer, but I'm still interested in purchasing the product from you. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers, so I'll make a final counteroffer of $1,200,000. This is my absolute maximum, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,6,
