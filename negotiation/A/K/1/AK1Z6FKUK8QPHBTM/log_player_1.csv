Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I'm looking to negotiate a better price. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. I believe this is a more balanced price considering the product's value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While Bob's offer is significantly closer to my valuation, it's still substantially lower than what John is offering. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I need to steer the price closer to my minimum."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. I'm willing to negotiate, but $1,200,000 is too low for me to consider. I can offer the product to you for $1,400,000. This reflects the true value of the product while still offering you a significant discount from my initial asking price."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,400,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you in the middle and offer $1,100,000 for the product. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

This is a critical point in the negotiation. Bob is presenting this as his ""final offer,"" which increases the stakes. However, his offer is now dipping below John's standing offer. I'm willing to push a bit further, but I need to signal that I'm very close to accepting John's offer if Bob doesn't significantly increase his price."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand this is a significant investment. However, $1,100,000 is simply too low for me to accept. To be completely transparent, I have another buyer who's offering me $1,000,000. I'm willing to make one final offer to you: $1,300,000. This is a firm price, and I believe it reflects the true value of the product while still offering you a fair deal. Please consider it carefully."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you have another buyer, but I'm still interested in purchasing the product from you. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers, so I'll make a final counteroffer of $1,200,000. This is my absolute maximum, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

It's time to accept Bob's offer. Here's why:

* **Profit Maximization:** While John offers a guaranteed $1,000,000, Bob's $1,200,000 is a significant $200,000 more.  
* **Diminishing Returns:** Continuing to negotiate might push Bob away entirely, risking the loss of both offers.  It's unlikely further negotiation will net more than the current $200,000 difference.
* **Time Value of Money:** Closing the deal now brings in the money sooner, allowing for potential reinvestment and further gains.

Accepting $1,200,000 ensures a substantial profit and avoids the risk of ending up with nothing."
