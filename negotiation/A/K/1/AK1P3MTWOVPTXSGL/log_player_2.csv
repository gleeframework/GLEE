"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $110. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Here's why:

* **Your maximum price:** You're willing to pay up to $120.
* **Alice's price:** Alice is offering the product for $110.
* **John's price:** John is selling for $120.

Since Alice's offer is lower than your maximum and lower than John's price, it's the best deal for you."
