"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. I know it's worth a lot to you, and I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm starting with a price of $1,450,000. This reflects the significant value it holds for you while also giving me a fair return on my investment.",1450000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,300,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider a price closer to $1,300,000?",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have a budget, and I respect that. However, $1,300,000 is simply too low for me to consider.  The value of this product is significantly higher, and I'm willing to negotiate further.  Let's meet in the middle at $1,400,000. This would allow us both to achieve our goals. ",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $1,350,000? This is a compromise that would allow me to stay within my means while still recognizing the value of the product.",1350000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm willing to make one final compromise. I can't go lower than $1,425,000. This is a price that reflects the value of the product while still allowing us to reach an agreement.  If you're not willing to go higher, I'll need to explore other options.",1425000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand your final compromise, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable going above $1,325,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers. Would you consider $1,362,500? This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1362500.0,Bob,6,
