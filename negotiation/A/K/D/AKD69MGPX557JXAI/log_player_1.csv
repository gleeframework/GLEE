Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. I know it's worth a lot to you, and I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm starting with a price of $1,450,000. This reflects the significant value it holds for you while also giving me a fair return on my investment."", ""product_price"": 1450000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,300,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider a price closer to $1,300,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $1,300,000 is a decent offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  I'm going to try to negotiate a higher price with Bob, but I'll keep the option of selling to John in mind if the negotiations don't progress favorably."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have a budget, and I respect that. However, $1,300,000 is simply too low for me to consider.  The value of this product is significantly higher, and I'm willing to negotiate further.  Let's meet in the middle at $1,400,000. This would allow us both to achieve our goals. "", ""product_price"": 1400000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $1,350,000? This is a compromise that would allow me to stay within my means while still recognizing the value of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,350,000 is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to try to negotiate a higher price with Bob, but I'm also getting closer to my limit with the number of rounds remaining. If this counteroffer doesn't work, I might consider selling to John."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm willing to make one final compromise. I can't go lower than $1,425,000. This is a price that reflects the value of the product while still allowing us to reach an agreement.  If you're not willing to go higher, I'll need to explore other options."", ""product_price"": 1425000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your final compromise, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable going above $1,325,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers. Would you consider $1,362,500? This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,362,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,362,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's final offer is still below my minimum acceptable price. With only 4 rounds remaining, the risk of not reaching a satisfactory deal with Bob is high. To guarantee a profit and avoid further negotiation, I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,500,000."
