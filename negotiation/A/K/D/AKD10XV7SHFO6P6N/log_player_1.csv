Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides."",
""product_price"": 119
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's maximum valuation ($100) as possible while staying above our own minimum ($120).
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $119 creates the perception of a deal and a small ""loss"" on our end, potentially enticing Bob to buy.
* **Alternative Guarantee:** Even if Bob rejects the offer, we have a guaranteed sale to John at $120.

This strategy prioritizes securing a sale at a profitable price while leaving a small margin for Bob to feel like he's getting a good deal."
