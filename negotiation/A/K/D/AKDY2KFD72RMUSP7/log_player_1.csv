I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, but still below my minimum.  This allows room for negotiation and hopefully gets Bob thinking about the deal."

Round 2
Bob's offer:

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

Bob's offer is still below my minimum price of $15,000. I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can push for a better price.  While John's offer is tempting, I want to see if I can secure a higher price from Bob.  There are still 6 rounds left."

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum price of $15,000.  While I would prefer to get closer to my desired price, I've already been through 5 rounds of negotiation and we are getting close to the end.   I am going to sell the product to John for $15,000 to secure a deal and guarantee my minimum price."
