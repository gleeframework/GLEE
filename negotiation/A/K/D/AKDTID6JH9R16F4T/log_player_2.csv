"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to show you our top-of-the-line product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $11,500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $11,500 is a good deal, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $10,000.  Therefore, rejecting the offer and attempting to negotiate a lower price makes sense."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I really appreciate you coming down a bit.  However, I'm looking to spend closer to $10,000.  Would you be willing to consider $10,500?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're looking to spend closer to $10,000, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming for a price closer to his maximum budget of $10,000. While Alice has come down slightly, $11,000 is still too high. It's worth trying to negotiate further, especially since there are still several rounds left."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm still looking for a price closer to $10,000, so I'm going to offer $10,750.  This is a good middle ground, and I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 10750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to get closer to your target price, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go below $11,200. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $11,200. This is as low as I can go. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has stated that $11,200 is her bottom line.  Bob has already made a counteroffer at $10,750, and there is a significant gap between their offers. With only 5 rounds left, the chances of successfully negotiating a price below $11,000 are slim.  

Given that Bob can buy the product from John for $10,000, it's the most financially sound decision to buy from John.  This ensures he gets the product within his budget and avoids further negotiation."
