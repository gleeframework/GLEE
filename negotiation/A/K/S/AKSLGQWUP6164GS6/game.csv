"Alice, thanks for the offer, but the price is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay a price closer to its actual value. How about we start at $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to save some money, but I'm not willing to go as low as $800,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me a bit closer to my budget. However, $1,050,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go. Would you be willing to consider $925,000?",925000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go as low as $925,000, but I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,050,000 and $925,000. Let's try $987,500. This is a fair compromise that should satisfy both of our interests.",987500.0,Alice,5,
