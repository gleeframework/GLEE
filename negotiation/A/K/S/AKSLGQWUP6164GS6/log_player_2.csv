Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not willing to go as low as $925,000, but I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,050,000 and $925,000. Let's try $987,500. This is a fair compromise that should satisfy both of our interests. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $987,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $987,500

Alice is consistently meeting in the middle, and further negotiation is unlikely to yield a significantly better price. Accepting at $987,500 secures a decent discount while avoiding the risk of the deal falling through."
