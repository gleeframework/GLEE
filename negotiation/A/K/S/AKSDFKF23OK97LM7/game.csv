"Hello Bob, I'm excited to show you our top-of-the-line product. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to make a special offer just for you. I'll sell it to you for $1200000.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the offer, $1200000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $900000 at this time.  Let me know what you think.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $900000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to be flexible. I can see the value of the product to you, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now willing to sell it to you for $1050000. Let me know if this is more to your liking.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1050000 is still a bit higher than I can comfortably go.  Would you be willing to come down to $950000?  This is my final offer before I consider John's proposal.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $950000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but this time I'll meet you at $1025000. This is my final counteroffer before considering other options.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
