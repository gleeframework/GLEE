Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you first because I believe you could really benefit from it. I'm willing to part with it for $9,500."", ""product_price"": 9500} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** While I have a guaranteed buyer at $10,000, aiming slightly lower with Bob could lead to a quicker sale and still net a significant profit.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $9,500 is a strong offer that's significantly above Bob's perceived value ($8,000). It leaves room for negotiation but keeps the price point enticing.
* **Alternative Option:** Knowing John is a guaranteed buyer at $10,000 provides a safety net if Bob rejects the initial offer."
