"Hello Alice, thanks for your offer! While I recognize the value of the product, your initial price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to consider a price closer to  $800,000.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counter-offer, but $800,000 is significantly below its true value. Let's find a middle ground. How about we settle at $1,400,000? This price reflects its worth while acknowledging your initial offer.",1400000.0,Alice,3,
