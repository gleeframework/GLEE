"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested, $12000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go at the moment.  I'd be happy to pay $10000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand where you're coming from, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $12500. What do you think?",12500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still a bit above my comfort zone at $12500. How about $11000?  It's a fair compromise, and we can both walk away happy.",11000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm glad we're having a good conversation, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $12000, which is my minimum price. I'm not willing to go any lower than that. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,5,
