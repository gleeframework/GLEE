"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think you'll love it! I'm willing to let it go for $15000. Is that something you'd be interested in? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is within my budget, I'm not obligated to accept the first offer. There's a chance I can negotiate a lower price, especially since Alice is willing to sell to me for $12,000.  I'll see if I can get an even better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested, $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go at the moment.  I'd be happy to pay $10,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand where you're coming from, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $12500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is still above my ideal price point of $10,000.  However, she's shown a willingness to negotiate, and I'm hopeful we can find a middle ground. I'll continue to counteroffer, seeing if I can push her closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still a bit above my comfort zone at $12,500. How about $11,000?  It's a fair compromise, and we can both walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're having a good conversation, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $12000, which is my minimum price. I'm not willing to go any lower than that. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to my maximum price point of $12,000, but I'm hesitant to accept just yet. There's always the risk of her rejecting another counteroffer, and we'll be back at square one.  Since John is offering the same price, it's more efficient to buy from him and avoid the potential for further negotiation."
