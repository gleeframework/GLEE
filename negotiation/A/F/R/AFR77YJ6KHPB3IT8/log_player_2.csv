Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're eager to get this product, and I appreciate your offer.  However,  $1,300,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to stay above $1,350,000 to make this worthwhile.  Let's meet in the middle at $1,375,000.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're pushing for the lowest possible price, but I'm still confident in the value of this product.  $1,300,000 simply doesn't cover my costs.
