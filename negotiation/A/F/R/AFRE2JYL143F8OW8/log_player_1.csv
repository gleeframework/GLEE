``` 

While I could push for more, accepting $1,050,000 is a reasonable outcome at this stage. Bob is clearly demonstrating price sensitivity, and it's unlikely he'll go much higher. Accepting now ensures I make a significant profit above my minimum and avoids the risk of losing him as a buyer entirely."
