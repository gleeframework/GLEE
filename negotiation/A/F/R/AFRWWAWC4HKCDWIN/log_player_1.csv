Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm asking for $150. It's a great deal!"",
""product_price"": 150
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $100, you can aim higher with Bob. Starting at $150 allows room for negotiation while still being a significant profit if Bob accepts."
