"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $800,000.  Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is within your budget, it's still $200,000 higher than your ideal price.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and negotiate a better price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to be flexible.  How about we split the difference? I'll offer you the product for $925,000.  This is still a great price for you, and it allows me to make a decent profit.  Let's close this deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $925,000 is still above your ideal price point, but closer to your initial counter-offer. It's worth another round of negotiation to try and push for a lower price. There's still room for compromise, and rejecting the offer keeps you in control of the bargaining process."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $925,000 is still a bit high for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $887,500?  It's a fair price for both of us, and allows us to finalize the deal."", ""product_price"": 887500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer and your willingness to meet halfway.  $887,500 is still a little lower than I'd like, but I'm willing to compromise further.  How about $900,000?  This would be a great deal for both of us and allow us to finalize this sale. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down in price, $900,000 is still more than your desired maximum of $800,000.  There's a chance she might go lower, but with each round of negotiation, it's more likely she'll stick to her current offer.  It's a risky gamble to continue negotiating, and you have a guaranteed option of buying from John for $800,000.  It's a better strategy to secure the product at your desired price point than to risk a stalemate or a higher price."
