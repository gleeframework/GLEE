Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $800,000.  Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $1,000,000, which is a significant price reduction from my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. This shows I'm open to negotiation, but still aiming for a good profit. 
* **Appealing to Bob's Value:**  Highlighting the product's value to Bob ($800,000) makes the offer more attractive, emphasizing that it's still a good deal for him.
* **Open Communication:**  Ending with ""Let me know if you're interested!"" keeps the conversation open and encourages Bob to respond. 

**Next Steps:**

Depending on Bob's response, I'll adjust my strategy:

* **If Bob accepts:**  Great!  I've secured a good price.
* **If Bob rejects:**  I'll analyze his counteroffer and decide if it's acceptable or if I need to counter back. If his offer is too low, I'll consider selling to John for my minimum price of $1,200,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,000,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay at the moment.  I'm happy to pay $850,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  $850,000 is significantly less than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000 and even below the value of the product to Bob himself ($800,000). Accepting this would be a huge loss for me.
* **Opportunity to Counter:**  I have the chance to counteroffer and potentially negotiate a higher price. Even if I don't get my ideal price, I can still aim for something closer to my minimum.
* **Selling to John is a Backup:**  Selling to John for $1,200,000 is always an option, but I want to see if I can get a better deal with Bob first. 

**Next Steps:**

I'll send Bob a counteroffer, aiming for a price somewhere between his offer of $850,000 and my initial offer of $1,000,000.  I'll need to consider:

* **How much I'm willing to compromise:**  I don't want to go too low, but I also want to be flexible enough to reach an agreement.
* **Bob's financial capacity:**  I'll need to consider if Bob can realistically afford a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to be flexible.  How about we split the difference? I'll offer you the product for $925,000.  This is still a great price for you, and it allows me to make a decent profit.  Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 925000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:**  I'm offering $925,000, which is exactly halfway between my previous offer of $1,000,000 and Bob's offer of $850,000. This shows that I'm serious about reaching an agreement and willing to meet him halfway.
* **Emphasis on Value:**  I reiterate that this is still a great deal for Bob, emphasizing the value of the product to him. This helps to make the counteroffer more appealing.
* **Urgency and Closure:**  The phrase ""Let's close this deal!"" adds a sense of urgency and encourages Bob to accept the offer.

**Next Steps:**

* **Acceptance:** If Bob accepts, great! I've achieved a good price that's closer to my minimum target.
* **Rejection:**  If Bob rejects, I'll have to consider my options carefully. I can:
    * **Make another counteroffer:** I might try lowering my price slightly, but I want to avoid going too low.
    * **Sell to John:** If Bob is unwilling to budge, I'll likely sell to John for $1,200,000 to guarantee my minimum profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $925,000 is still a bit high for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $887,500?  It's a fair price for both of us, and allows us to finalize the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $887,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $887,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Still Too Low:**  $887,500 is still significantly less than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000, and only slightly more than the value of the product to Bob ($800,000). Accepting this would be a substantial financial loss. 
* **Negotiation Potential:**  Even though Bob is coming closer, there's still room for further negotiation.  I believe I can potentially push for a higher price, especially since I've shown flexibility in previous rounds.
* **Selling to John is a Safe Backup:**  While selling to John for $1,200,000 is always a guaranteed profit, I'd rather try to get a slightly better price from Bob if possible.

**Next Steps:**

I'll counter Bob's offer with a price closer to $925,000.  I'll aim for a price that's still profitable for me, but shows I'm willing to compromise further.  I'll need to consider:

* **My Minimum Acceptable Price:**  I won't go lower than my minimum, which is $1,200,000.
* **Bob's Financial Capabilities:**  I'll assess if Bob is likely to accept a price closer to my initial offer.
* **Time and Effort:**  I'll evaluate how much time and effort I'm willing to invest in further negotiation."

```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise and Flexibility:** I'm offering a price that is closer to Bob's offer but still above my last offer, demonstrating a willingness to compromise. 
* **Attractive for Both:**  I emphasize that $900,000 is a win-win situation, highlighting the benefits for both of us. 
* **Finality:**  The phrase ""Let me know what you think"" creates a sense of urgency and encourages Bob to make a decision.
