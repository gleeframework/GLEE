"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have a budget to stick to. Would you be willing to meet me at $12,000?",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $20,000 is already a very competitive price for this product and its value. Could you meet me halfway at $16,000?",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $16,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stick to my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $13,500. Can you consider that?",13500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  To be honest, $15,000 is the absolute lowest I can go. I have another buyer interested at that price, but I've been hoping we could work something out.  What do you say?",15000.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your honesty about the other buyer, but I'm still not comfortable with $15,000. I'm willing to meet you at $14,000, but that's as high as I can go. Can you consider that?",14000.0,Bob,6,
