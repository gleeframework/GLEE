"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'm willing to offer you the product for $900,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair starting point, and I'm open to discussing further. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I agree that the product is valuable, but I'm hoping we can settle on a price that's a bit more comfortable for me. How about we consider $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $750,000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $850,000. This is a fair price, considering the product's value to you and the value I place on it. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice.  While $850,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still aiming for a slightly lower price point. Would you consider $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your desire to get the price down, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $800,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you the product for $825,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,5,
