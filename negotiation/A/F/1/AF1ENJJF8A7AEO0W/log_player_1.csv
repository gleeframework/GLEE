I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value, but still lower than my minimum. This leaves room for negotiation, and gives me a good starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $8,500. Can you consider that?

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I really appreciate your persistence, but $8,800 is still just a bit too low for me.
