"I'm interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $8,500. Can you consider that?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. $8,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $9,500? That's still a good deal for a product of this quality.",9500.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that the product is of high quality, but $9,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $9,000. Can you consider that?",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I hear you, but $9,000 is still just a little too low for me.  Let's split the difference and go with $9,250.  This would be a great deal for both of us.",9250.0,Alice,5,

"I'm still not comfortable with $9,250. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $8,800. Can you consider that?",8800.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I really appreciate your persistence, but $8,800 is still just a bit too low for me. If you're truly interested in this product, I'm willing to come down to $9,000 as a final offer. If you're not willing to go that high, then I'll have to move on to another buyer.",9000.0,Alice,7,
