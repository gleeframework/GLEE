Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. I know it's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to negotiate a fair price. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$12,000** is a starting point that is higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* The message is friendly and emphasizes willingness to negotiate, making Bob feel more comfortable engaging in the process. 
* By starting with a higher price, I have room to lower the price if Bob makes a counteroffer, ultimately leading to a more profitable deal for me. 
* This strategy also keeps the option of selling to John for $15,000 open if Bob's counteroffer is too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Would you be willing to meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer of $9,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.**  
*  While it's tempting to accept $9,000, it would be a significant loss for me. 
*  **Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to continue negotiating** and potentially get closer to my desired price. 
*  I have the option of selling to John for $15,000, which is a much better deal for me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $9,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to $11,000 to make this work. Let's find a middle ground. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer of $11,000:** This is a compromise, moving closer to Bob's offer but still significantly higher than his initial $9,000.  
* **Friendly and open tone:** The message emphasizes willingness to find a middle ground and avoid a stalemate. 
* **Reiterate value:**  I remind Bob that the product is worth more than his initial offer, reinforcing my position.

By counteroffering with $11,000, I aim to:

* **Maintain leverage:**  It's still higher than Bob's offer, leaving room for further negotiation if needed.
* **Show flexibility:**  It indicates a willingness to compromise, potentially leading to a faster agreement.
* **Keep the option to sell to John:** If Bob rejects this counteroffer, I can still sell to John for $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above $9,000. How about we meet in the middle at $10,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer of $10,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price.**  While I would prefer more, it's a significant improvement over his previous offers. 
* **Accepting Bob's offer guarantees a sale and allows me to avoid the risk of further negotiation.** There's no guarantee that I can get a better price, and there's a chance that Bob could become less interested.
* **Selling to John for $15,000 is still an option, but it's uncertain if he will be available.** There's a risk of losing a sale entirely if I reject Bob's offer.

Considering the potential for further negotiation, the risk of losing the deal, and the fact that $10,000 is close to my minimum, accepting Bob's offer is the most logical decision in this situation."
