"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's worth a lot to me, but I believe it could be a game-changer for your business as well. I'm willing to let it go for $1,200,000. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **High initial offer:** Starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value creates room for negotiation and allows me to capture a significant portion of the surplus value. 
* **Positive framing:** Emphasizing the potential benefits for Bob and highlighting the product's worth creates a sense of value and encourages him to consider the offer.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  I've left space for Bob to counteroffer without immediately resorting to selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  while I appreciate your offer, it's significantly above my budget. I'm interested in this product but can only offer $850000 at this time. It's the highest I can go, given my financial constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $850,000 is a significant amount, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. Accepting Bob's offer would result in a loss for me. I'm confident I can negotiate a better price or sell to John for a higher amount.  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to continue the negotiation and explore better possibilities."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your financial constraints. However, $850,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This price reflects the immense value this product can bring to your business and is still a reasonable compromise. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm lowering my price slightly from the previous round, demonstrating willingness to negotiate while still maintaining a price that is profitable for me.
* **Focus on value:**  I reiterate the value proposition of the product, emphasizing its potential benefits to Bob.
* **Compromise language:**  Using phrases like ""reasonable compromise"" and ""find a middle ground"" positions the counteroffer as a step towards a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1050000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $950000.  This is a significant increase from my previous offer and shows my genuine interest in acquiring this product. I believe this price reflects a fair compromise, considering the value it offers both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $950,000 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still not enough. I'm not willing to sell for less than $1,000,000, which I can get from John. 

Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to continue negotiating, potentially reaching a higher price, or to sell to John if the negotiations continue to stall."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $950,000 isn't quite there yet. Given the product's potential and the significant benefits it can bring to your business, I'm willing to compromise further and offer it for $1,000,000. This is my final offer, reflecting the minimum value I can accept.  Let's finalize this deal and unlock its true potential."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Final offer:**  I'm now setting a firm price of $1,000,000,  making it clear that this is my bottom line.
* **Emphasize the value:** I'm re-emphasizing the value and benefits of the product to Bob, reminding him of the potential return on investment.
* **Call to action:**  I'm urging Bob to finalize the deal, making it clear that this is a time-sensitive opportunity.

**Reasoning:**

* I'm at my minimum acceptable price, but I'm still leaving room for Bob to accept.
* By framing it as a final offer, I'm putting pressure on Bob to make a decision.
* If Bob rejects this offer, I'll be ready to sell to John for the same price, ensuring a successful outcome for me."
