"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's worth a lot to me, but I believe it could be a game-changer for your business as well. I'm willing to let it go for $1200000. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is way above your maximum budget.  It's best to reject the offer and see if she's willing to come down in price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  while I appreciate your offer, it's significantly above my budget. I'm interested in this product but can only offer $850,000 at this time. It's the highest I can go, given my financial constraints."", ""product_price"": 850000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer. This is to establish a strong starting point for negotiation.  I'm hoping this will encourage Alice to consider a lower price, while still leaving room for further negotiation in the following rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your financial constraints. However, $850000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1050000. This price reflects the immense value this product can bring to your business and is still a reasonable compromise. Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still above my budget.  I'm going to reject this offer and continue negotiating.  I believe I can still get a better price, given that the deal with John is a backup option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,050,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $950,000.  This is a significant increase from my previous offer and shows my genuine interest in acquiring this product. I believe this price reflects a fair compromise, considering the value it offers both of us."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer, but still staying within my budget.  This shows Alice that I'm serious about making a deal, and that I'm willing to compromise.  By emphasizing the value the product offers us both, I'm hoping to persuade Alice to accept this counteroffer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but $950000 isn't quite there yet. Given the product's potential and the significant benefits it can bring to your business, I'm willing to compromise further and offer it for $1000000. This is my final offer, reflecting the minimum value I can accept.  Let's finalize this deal and unlock its true potential. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above my budget. While I could continue negotiating, I'm running out of time. With only 5 rounds left, it's more strategic to buy from John.  His offer is within my budget, and guarantees a deal. It's better to secure the product at a price I'm comfortable with than risk losing the opportunity altogether."
