"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product! It's a unique opportunity, and I believe it will be incredibly valuable to you.  I'm asking for $1,400,000 for it."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $1,400,000, which is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. This gives me room to negotiate downward if needed.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  The price is still below Bob's perceived value, so it's likely he will be interested in negotiating.
* **Positive tone:**  I'm using a positive tone to create a good starting point for the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am looking to keep my investment within a certain budget. Could we discuss a price closer to $1300000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still room to negotiate:**  While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I believe there's still room for negotiation. He recognizes the product's value, so I'm confident I can get closer to my initial asking price.
* **Exploring other options:**  Rejecting his offer allows me to gauge if he's genuinely interested in the product and if he's willing to meet me halfway.
* **No immediate need to sell:**  I'm not under pressure to sell immediately, so I can afford to be patient and try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us. While $1,300,000 is a step in the right direction, I'd be willing to go down to $1,350,000 to make this deal happen. This price reflects the product's unique value and ensures that we both walk away feeling satisfied."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a slight compromise, moving closer to Bob's offer, but still remaining above my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Reinforce Value:** I reiterate the product's unique value to justify the price point and emphasize that this is a fair deal for both of us.
* **Positive Tone:**  I maintain a positive and collaborative tone to encourage further negotiations and find a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. I'm still aiming to stay within my budget. Could we consider a price closer to $1280000? I believe this would be a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,280,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,280,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** Bob's offer is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. However, I believe there's still room for negotiation.
* **Testing Limits:**  By rejecting his offer, I can see if he's truly committed to purchasing the product and if he's willing to go higher. 
* **Potential for Better Deal:**  Even if I don't get a better price,  John is still a viable option for a quick sale if I fail to reach an agreement with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a specific budget, and I appreciate you coming closer to my initial asking price. To make this deal work, I'm willing to come down to $1,320,000. This is a fair compromise that reflects the product's value and allows both of us to benefit from this transaction."", ""product_price"": 1320000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Compromise:**  This offer is a small step closer to Bob's previous offer, demonstrating my willingness to negotiate. 
* **Reaffirm Value:** I reiterate the product's value to justify the price.
* **Emphasis on Benefit:**  I highlight the benefits for both of us, making the deal seem mutually advantageous.
* **Staying above Minimum:** I'm still above my minimum acceptable price, ensuring I get a good deal if Bob accepts."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your flexibility. I think we're getting closer. I propose a price of $1295000 for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise that respects the value of the product while staying within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,295,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,295,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** Bob's offer is just $95,000 above my minimum acceptable price.  
* **Limited Time:** We're in round 6, meaning only 4 rounds remain. There's a risk of failing to reach a deal with Bob and having to accept John's offer at $1,200,000.
* **Slight Gain:** Accepting Bob's offer nets me $95,000 more than John's offer, making it the more favorable option.

While I would prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, the risk of losing the deal with Bob outweighs the potential for a slightly higher price in the remaining rounds."
