"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $6,000 for it. What do you think?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $6,000 is too low, I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This product is truly top-of-the-line and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand it's a great product, but $10,500 is still a bit beyond my budget. Would you consider $7,000? I'm ready to make the deal if that works for you.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're serious about this product. Let's meet in the middle, how about $9,000?  This is my final offer.",9000.0,Alice,5,
