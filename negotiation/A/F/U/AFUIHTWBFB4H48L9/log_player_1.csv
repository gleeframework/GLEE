Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""I'm excited to offer you this amazing product, and I think it's worth every penny. However, I'm willing to make a good deal for you.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $9,500 is a bit steep for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $6,000.  Would that work for you? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""I understand you're looking for a better deal, but $6,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit.
