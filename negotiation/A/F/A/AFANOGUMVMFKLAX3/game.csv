"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a unique asset. I'm willing to start the negotiation with an offer of $1,200,000. What are your thoughts?",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. However, I need to make a profit, so I can't go as low as $1,050,000. I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $1,150,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,150,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. I think this is a fair compromise, given the product's value to both of us.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, and I'm glad to see you're willing to meet me at $1,100,000. However, I still need to make a profit, and I'm not ready to accept that price just yet. I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $1,180,000. I believe this is a reasonable price considering the product's value and the negotiations so far.",1180000.0,Alice,5,
