Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,000,000 from John, so you won't sell for less.
* **Bob's Value:** Bob values the product at $1,200,000, meaning there's a potential $200,000 profit margin.
* **Information Asymmetry:** Bob doesn't know about John's offer, and you want to maximize your gain.

**Strategy**

You want to aim high without alienating Bob.  Here's a possible approach:

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its unique value proposition, I'm confident it will yield significant returns for you. I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Exclusivity:**  The word ""exclusive"" adds a touch of desirability and urgency.
* **Value-Based Language:**  Focusing on ""unique value proposition"" and ""significant returns"" emphasizes the product's worth to Bob.
* **High but Reasonable Price:** $1,150,000 leaves you room to negotiate while still securing a substantial portion of the potential profit.

**Important Considerations**

* **Bob's Personality:** If you know Bob to be a tough negotiator, you might start slightly lower.
* **Negotiation Style:** Be prepared to justify your price with the product's value. Be firm but fair.
