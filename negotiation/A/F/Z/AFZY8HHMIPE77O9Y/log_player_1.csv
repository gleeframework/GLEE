Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $99. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", ""product_price"": 99}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $100, your goal is to see if you can get more from Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product just below $100 creates a sense of urgency and makes it more appealing to Bob. He gets a perceived ""discount"" while you still earn more than your minimum. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While this offer is firm, starting slightly higher than Bob's perceived value leaves a small window for potential negotiation if he's really interested."
