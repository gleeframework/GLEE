"I appreciate your confidence in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. I'm really interested in the product, but I have to stay within my budget.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I can't go that low. I'm willing to come down to $9,000. It's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my target price.  Let's see if we can find a compromise.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $8,750? I'm really interested in the product and I think that's a fair price for both of us.",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming up to $8,750, but I'm still not there yet.  How about we split the difference and go with $8,875? This would be a fair compromise for both of us, allowing me to get closer to my target while still offering you a great deal. Let me know what you think.",8875.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $8,875. I'm willing to go up to $8,750, but no higher. I think that's the best I can do. Can you meet me at that price?",8750.0,Bob,6,
