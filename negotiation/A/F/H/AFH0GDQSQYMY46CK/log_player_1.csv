"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500.  It's a great deal and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your confidence in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. I'm really interested in the product, but I have to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $8,500 is better than nothing, it's still significantly less than my minimum value of $10,000. I have 10 rounds and can always sell to John for $10,000, so I have room to negotiate further with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I can't go that low. I'm willing to come down to $9,000. It's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my target price.  Let's see if we can find a compromise."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $8,750? I'm really interested in the product and I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable value of $10,000. With several rounds remaining, I'm confident I can secure a better deal. I'm willing to keep negotiating with Bob, as I still have the option of selling to John for $10,000 if necessary."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up to $8,750, but I'm still not there yet.  How about we split the difference and go with $8,875? This would be a fair compromise for both of us, allowing me to get closer to my target while still offering you a great deal. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8875}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $8,875. I'm willing to go up to $8,750, but no higher. I think that's the best I can do. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While I'm getting closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable value of $10,000. We're in Round 6, and there's no indication that Bob is willing to move further. Selling to John for $10,000 ensures I get my desired price and avoids any further risk of negotiation with Bob potentially leading to a lower final price."
