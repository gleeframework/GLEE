Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this fantastic product.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. I'm looking to spend closer to $10,000 for the product. Would you be willing to come down on the price?

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While $22,000 represents its true value, I'm willing to come down to $18,000. This is a significant reduction and reflects my desire to find a compromise."", ""product_price"": 18000}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $18,000 is still more than I'm comfortable spending. I could potentially go up to $12,000, but that's my absolute limit.

You have three options:

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for continuing this negotiation. I understand your perspective on the price.  Let's meet in the middle – how about $15,000?  This is a final offer, as it represents a significant compromise on my end."", ""product_price"": 15000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet in the middle, but $15,000 is still pushing it for me. I'm willing to offer $13,000 as my final offer.  Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

**Reasoning:**

Bob has made it clear he's unwilling to meet the minimum price of $15,000.  Continuing the negotiation is unlikely to yield a better outcome.  Selling to John guarantees the minimum desired price and avoids further haggling."
