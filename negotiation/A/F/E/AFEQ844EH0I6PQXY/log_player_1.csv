Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am looking to stay within a budget of $12,000. Would you be willing to negotiate further? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is significantly below my minimum threshold of $15,000. While it's tempting to accept due to the limited rounds, I'm going to hold out and see if I can get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget, but I'm unable to go that low.  I'm willing to come down to $13,500.  This is still a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll find it worth the investment. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 13500}

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $13,000 is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum threshold of $15,000. I have several rounds left, and I believe I can push for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a bit higher than that. How about $13,250? This is a fair compromise, and it gets us closer to a deal. Let's try to close this now."", ""product_price"": 13250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I'm glad we're making progress. I would like to counter with an offer of $13,100. I hope this is acceptable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,100.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

We're nearing the end of the negotiation rounds, and while Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below $15,000. I'm not confident I can push him any higher in the remaining rounds.  Therefore, I'll sell to John for $15,000 to ensure I meet my minimum price target."
