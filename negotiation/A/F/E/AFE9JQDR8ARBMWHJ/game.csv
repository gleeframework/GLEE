"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps closer to $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $800,000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,000,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, as it's still a significant discount from the original price.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
