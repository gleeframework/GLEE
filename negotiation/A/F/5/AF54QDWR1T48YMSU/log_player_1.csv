Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I know it's of significant value to you, and I'm willing to make a deal at $1,400,000. This offer is only valid for a limited time, as I have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we know John will buy the product for $1,500,000,  getting Bob to buy it allows us to maximize profit.
* **Understanding Value:**  Bob values the product at $1,000,000, so offering it below that would be leaving money on the table. 
* **Creating Urgency:**  By mentioning other interested parties and a limited time offer, we encourage Bob to act quickly.
* **Leaving Negotiation Room:** Starting at $1,400,000 leaves room for Bob to potentially negotiate up slightly, while still securing a significant profit for Alice."
