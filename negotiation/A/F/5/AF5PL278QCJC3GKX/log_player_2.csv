"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this great product! It's a one-of-a-kind item that I think you'll really love. I'm willing to let it go for $100. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You're aiming to save as much money as possible. While $100 is within your budget, it's still more than the product's worth to Alice ($80).  There's room for negotiation, so rejecting the initial offer and making a counteroffer is the best strategy."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate the enthusiasm.  However, $100 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $90 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob. I can do a bit better than $90, but I'm not willing to go as low as $100. How about we meet in the middle at $95? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is now closer to your desired price:** $95 is only $5 more than your counteroffer of $90. 
* **The potential savings are significant:** Accepting this offer saves you $25 compared to buying from John.
* **There's limited room for further negotiation:**  Alice has already shown she's willing to compromise, and further haggling might risk losing the deal. 

It's a good deal for you, balancing your desire to save money with the risk of losing the product or paying more to John."
