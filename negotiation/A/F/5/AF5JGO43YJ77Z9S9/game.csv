"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $750,000 is significantly below what this product is worth. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair return on my investment. How about we meet in the middle at $850,000? This price reflects the product's value and allows for a reasonable profit for both of us.",850000.0,Alice,3,
