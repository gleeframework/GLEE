Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity to consider this product. While I see its potential, $850000 is a bit higher than my current budget. I'm willing to offer $700000 for it. This is a fair starting point given the value I'm seeing. What are your thoughts? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000

This is a fair middle ground that I hope we can both agree on."", ""product_price"": 750000}"
