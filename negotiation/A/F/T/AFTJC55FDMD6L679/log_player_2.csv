"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own a unique item that can bring immense value to your life. I'm willing to sell it to you for $850000. This is a fair price considering its worth to me, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Unknown Value:**  You don't know the product's true value to Alice, so $850,000 could be a good deal or a rip-off. 
* **Negotiation Potential:** You have 10 rounds, so there's room to try and negotiate a lower price. 
* **John's Offer:** While John's offer is a safety net, it's in your best interest to try and get a better deal. 

**Strategy:** Rejecting the offer allows you to start the negotiation process and explore if you can get a price closer to your ideal value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity to consider this product. While I see its potential, $850,000 is a bit higher than my current budget. I'm willing to offer $700,000 for it. This is a fair starting point given the value I'm seeing. What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 700000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer Strategy:**  This counter-offer is a significant reduction from Alice's initial price, showing your willingness to negotiate. It also sets a clear starting point for further discussion.
* **Realistic Price:** $700,000 is still a considerable amount, but it leaves room for Alice to compromise without feeling like she's giving away the product. 
* **Open-Ended Message:** The message keeps the negotiation open-ended, inviting Alice to respond with a counter-offer of her own."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm willing to consider a compromise. I'm thinking of a price that's closer to your offer, but still reflects the product's value to me. I'm willing to sell it to you for $750000. This is a fair middle ground that I hope we can both agree on. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Progress:** Alice has moved from $850,000 to $750,000, which is a substantial concession. This indicates she's willing to negotiate.
* **Middle Ground:**  $750,000 is a good middle ground between your offer and her previous price. 
* **Time Pressure:**  While you have more rounds, you don't want to risk losing the deal by being too stubborn. 

**Strategy:** Accepting this offer is a good move. You've successfully lowered the price and secured the product without risking a deal with John."
