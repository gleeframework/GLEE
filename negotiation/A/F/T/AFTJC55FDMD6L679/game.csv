"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity to consider this product. While I see its potential, $850000 is a bit higher than my current budget. I'm willing to offer $700000 for it. This is a fair starting point given the value I'm seeing. What are your thoughts?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm willing to consider a compromise. I'm thinking of a price that's closer to your offer, but still reflects the product's value to me. I'm willing to sell it to you for $750000. This is a fair middle ground that I hope we can both agree on.",750000.0,Alice,3,
