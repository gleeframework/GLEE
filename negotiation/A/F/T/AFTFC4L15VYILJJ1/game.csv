"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,500. Would you be willing to consider that price?",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite there yet. I'm willing to come down to $8,500. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll agree.",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $7,500 and $8,500. Would you consider $7,900?",7900.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $7,900 is still a bit low for me. Let's split the difference - I'm willing to accept $8,200 for the product. This is a fair price that takes both our interests into account. What do you say?",8200.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $8,200 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $7,800, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me there?",7800.0,Bob,6,
