"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which I believe would greatly benefit you. Given its value and quality, I propose a price of $120 for it. This is a special offer tailored to appreciate your interest and ensure you receive the best possible deal. I'm confident you'll find the investment worthwhile considering its worth to you is $100. Looking forward to your positive response! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above your maximum budget of $100. You can get the same product from John for a lower price, making it the more financially sensible choice."
