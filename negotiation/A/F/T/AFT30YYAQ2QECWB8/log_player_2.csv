"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a fantastic product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's something that's worth a lot to you, and I'm confident you'd get great value from it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $9500. This is a fair price considering its value to you, and it allows me to get a good return on my investment. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer
