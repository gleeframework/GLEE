"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $2,300,000. I believe this reflects its true worth.",2300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for your offer. While I see the value in the product, $2,300,000 is unfortunately out of my budget. I'm willing to offer $1,800,000 for it, reflecting its value and a fair price for both of us.",1800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand your perspective.  Considering the value this product brings, I'm willing to come down to $2,100,000. This feels like a fair compromise.",2100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. While I value the product, $2,100,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to offer $1,900,000, which I believe is a fair price for both of us. Let's find a solution that works for both parties.",1900000.0,Bob,4,
