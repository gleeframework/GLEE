"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $11,000. This leaves some room for negotiation, but it's still above Bob's perceived value of $8,000. I'm also keeping in mind my own minimum value of $12,000 and the possibility of selling to John for that amount if negotiations fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. $9,500 is still below my minimum value of $12,000. I'm willing to continue negotiating, hoping to get closer to my desired price.  While selling to John for $12,000 is an option, I'd prefer to see if I can get a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

I'm counteroffering with $10,500. This is a compromise from my initial offer and is closer to Bob's offer.  I'm trying to find a price that's acceptable to both of us while still ensuring I get at least a portion of my desired profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's getting closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired price. I'm not yet willing to sell for that amount, and I'm hoping that I can get a better offer from Bob in the next round. I'm also keeping in mind that I can always sell to John for $12,000, but I'm hoping to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm counteroffering with $10,000.  I'm getting closer to Bob's price, but I still need to ensure I get a decent profit. I'm hoping that he will accept this offer, but I am prepared to walk away and sell to John if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm choosing to sell to John. Bob's offer of $8,800 is getting too low for me. Even though I have 4 rounds left, I'm not confident I can get a better deal with Bob.  I'm willing to take the guaranteed $12,000 from John to ensure I get a good price and avoid further negotiation."
