"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to start the negotiation with a price of $1,200,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for the offer, but that price is too high for me. I'd be willing to purchase the product for $600,000."", ""product_price"": 600000} 
 
**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  By starting with a significantly lower offer, I'm aiming to establish a bargaining range that's more favorable to me. Even though it's far below Alice's asking price, it opens the door for negotiation.
* **Leaving Room to Negotiate:** This initial counteroffer gives me plenty of room to gradually increase my offer during subsequent rounds if necessary, while still staying well below my $800,000 maximum.
* **Testing the Waters:**  This lowball offer will also help me gauge Alice's flexibility and willingness to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $600,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking more along the lines of $900,000. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Up Incrementally:** I'm showing a willingness to negotiate by increasing my offer significantly from $600,000. 
* **Staying Below John's Price:** It's important to stay below my alternative option of buying from John for $800,000. 
* **Testing Alice's Flexibility:**  This offer will help me understand how much further Alice is willing to come down in price. It aims for a middle ground that could be agreeable to both parties."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see that you're still a bit hesitant, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm thinking of a price of $850,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price for the value the product brings. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is unlikely to budge:** Alice has stated that $850,000 is the lowest she's willing to go.  
* **John's offer is better:**  Buying from John for $800,000 saves me $50,000 and avoids further negotiation that might be fruitless. 
* **Time is Money:** Continuing to negotiate has a cost in terms of time and effort. Taking John's offer provides a guaranteed outcome at a better price."
