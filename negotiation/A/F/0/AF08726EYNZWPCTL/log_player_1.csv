Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm thrilled to offer you a chance to acquire this truly exceptional product. Its value is significant, and I believe it would be a tremendous asset to you.  Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,400,000. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial arrangement."",
""product_price"": 1400000

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, I believe $1,400,000 is a bit high. Would you consider a price closer to $1,100,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly below what you value the product for and what it's worth to him. You have room to negotiate and should aim for a price closer to $1,500,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  However,  $1,100,000  significantly undervalues the product's true worth and potential.  To find a middle ground, I'm proposing $1,300,000. This reflects the product's value while acknowledging your initial offer."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the value of the product, but I need a price that works for me.  Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $1,200,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

We're getting closer, but $1,200,000 is still below your target. It's worth pushing a bit further to see if Bob will increase his offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate us working towards a deal. Let's make it happen - I propose $1,275,000. This represents a significant concession on my part while still reflecting the true value of what's being offered."",

}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this negotiation is taking a while. I'm willing to offer $1,225,000 to get this done, but that's my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,225,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,225,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

Bob has presented his ""final offer,"" and while it's not ideal, it's significantly better than John's offer. Accepting now secures a solid profit and avoids the risk of Bob walking away in future rounds."
