"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product for $100. It's a steal! Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You can do better than $100. You're willing to pay up to $80, so rejecting Alice's offer and making a counteroffer is the best first move."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm really interested, but I'm only able to go up to $80 for it right now. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 80} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $80 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down a bit.  How about $90? It's still a good deal for you, and it gives me a bit more to work with. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

While $90 is better than Alice's first offer, it's still more than you're willing to pay.  You can get the product for your maximum price of $80 from John, so it's best to go with that option."
