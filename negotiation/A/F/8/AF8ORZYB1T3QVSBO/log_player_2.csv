"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly lower than the product's worth to her ($12,000). This suggests she's willing to negotiate.  There's room for both of us to find a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer that's halfway between Alice's offer and my maximum price. This shows I'm serious about buying the product but also that I'm not willing to accept her initial price. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is now very close to my maximum price ($12,000), and I'm only three rounds into the negotiation. Accepting her offer would mean saving $1,200 compared to buying from John. It's a good deal and I don't want to risk losing it by continuing to negotiate."
