This offer represents a good starting point for the negotiation. It's higher than your minimum value, but still leaves room for negotiation. It also shows Bob that you're serious about selling the product to him, but you're not desperate."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a little too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
