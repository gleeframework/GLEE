# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible product, and I think you'll really love it! I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000, which is a great deal considering its value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

Alice is starting at her maximum price. Since you know John will sell the product for $8,000, there's no reason to negotiate with Alice.  You'll save the most money by going directly to John."
