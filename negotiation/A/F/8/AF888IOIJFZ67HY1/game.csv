"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product!  It's valued at over $1.5 million to me, but I'm willing to part with it for $1,400,000.  This is a significant opportunity for you, as it's well below its true value.  What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I understand the product is valuable to you, but that price is a little high for me. I could consider something closer to $1,000,000.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate you taking the time to make a counteroffer. While $1,000,000 is a good starting point, it's still a bit below what I can accept.  Given the value of this product, I'd be willing to come down to $1,300,000.  This is a fair price that reflects both our interests. What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $1,300,000 is still a bit too high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,150,000? ",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $1,150,000 is still too low for me.  Let's meet in the middle once more - I'm prepared to offer the product for $1,250,000.  This is a significant price reduction from my initial offer, and I'm confident it's a fair compromise.  What do you say?",1250000.0,Alice,5,
