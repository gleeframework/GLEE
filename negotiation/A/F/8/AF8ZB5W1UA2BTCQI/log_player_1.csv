Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $15,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 15000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and makes you appear more flexible if you need to come down in price. 
* **Justification:** By mentioning the ""value,"" Alice subtly implies the product might be worth more than Bob's perceived $10,000.
* **Alternative:** Offering Bob the ""first chance"" creates a sense of scarcity and urgency, potentially pushing him to accept a higher price.

**Important Note:** While John provides a safety net, Alice's goal is to maximize profit. This offer balances ambition with the risk of Bob rejecting the offer."
