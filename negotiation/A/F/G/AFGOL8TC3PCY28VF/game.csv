"Thanks for the offer Alice, but $175 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay.  How about $140?  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",140.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you making a counteroffer, but $140 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, though.  How about $155?  That's a fair price considering the value of this product.",155.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, $155 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to go up to $150, which is the price John is selling it for. If that's not acceptable, I'll have to go with John.",150.0,Bob,4,
