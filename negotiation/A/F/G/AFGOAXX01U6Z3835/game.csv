"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. I think you'll find it's a game-changer. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1500000. What do you think?",1500000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm very interested in the product, but $1500000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. Can you meet me in the middle at $1350000?",1350000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're interested in the product, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $1350000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I get a good deal. I can offer it to you for $1400000. What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but $1400000 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to try to meet in the middle again. How about we aim for $1325000? I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1362500, but I think we can do better than that.",1325000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1325000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure it's worth my while. I can offer it to you for $1375000. This is my final offer, but I'm open to negotiations if you're willing to meet me at this price.",1375000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your final offer, Alice, but I'm afraid I'm not willing to go above $1325000. I'm willing to make one last attempt to meet in the middle. How about we meet at $1312500? This is my final offer, and I'm willing to walk away if we can't agree on this price.",1312500.0,Bob,6,

"I understand you're making a final attempt to meet in the middle, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1312500. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure it's worth my while. I can offer it to you for $1325000, but I'm only willing to do this because I think the product would be a great fit for you. I'm not willing to go any lower.",1325000.0,Alice,7,
