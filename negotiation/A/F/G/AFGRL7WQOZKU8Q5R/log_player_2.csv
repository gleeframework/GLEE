"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product at an exclusive price of $12,000. This is a special opportunity tailored just for you, considering the value you see in it. I believe this price reflects both the quality of the product and your appreciation for it. Let me know if you're interested in discussing further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You should reject Alice's offer. You can get the product for $8,000 from John, so there's no reason to pay more. You should now make a counteroffer to Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $12,000 is a bit higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  This is a fair price, considering the value I see in it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and respect your budget constraints. To better align with your financial situation while still valuing the product's quality, I propose a revised offer of $9,000 for the product. This price reflects a compromise between the product's value and your budget. I hope this proposal is more suitable for your needs. Please let me know if you would like to discuss further.

Alice's offer of $9,000 is still higher than what you're willing to pay. You can get the product from John for $8,000, so it makes more sense to buy it from him."
