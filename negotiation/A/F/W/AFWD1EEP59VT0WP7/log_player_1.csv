Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,300,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, reflecting its value to me. This is a fair price considering my budget and the potential benefits of the product. I'm open to further discussion. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but the product's value is truly significant. I've already factored in considerable flexibility in my initial offer.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000? This reflects the product's inherent worth while acknowledging your interest."", ""product_price"": 1100000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,100,000 is still beyond my budget.  I'm comfortable offering $900,000 for the product. This is a fair compromise, reflecting the value of the product and my financial constraints. Let's find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000

While Bob is moving closer to a reasonable offer, it's unlikely he'll reach the $1,000,000 mark I need.  John offers a guaranteed sale at my desired price."
