"Alice, thanks for the opening offer.  While I agree this product has value, I think $1,100,000 is too high. I'm willing to offer $650,000 to start the negotiation.",650000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the value, but $650,000 is significantly below what I can consider.  Let's find a middle ground - I'm proposing $975,000. This reflects the product's true worth while acknowledging your interest.",975000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me to find a compromise. However, $975,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I can go up to $725,000. I feel this is a fair offer that reflects the product's value while staying within my budget.",725000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm sensing we're getting closer.  While $725,000 is still below my ideal price, I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This is a significant concession on my part and demonstrates my commitment to making this deal work.",900000.0,Alice,5,
