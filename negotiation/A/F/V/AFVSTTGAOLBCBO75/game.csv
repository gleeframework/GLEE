"Thanks Alice, but $120 is a bit steep for me.  I'm interested, but I'd be willing to pay $90 for it.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a better deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $90. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $110. What do you think?",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice, but $110 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying. How about $105?  It's closer to my budget and a good compromise for both of us.",105.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to my minimum price, but I still need to make a profit. I can do $108, but that's as low as I can go. What do you think?",108.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I really appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm still a bit over my budget at $108.  How about $102?  It's a fair price for both of us and we can close the deal.",102.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal, but I still need to make a profit. I can do $106, but that's my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",106.0,Alice,7,
