Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $100. This is a reasonable starting point, as it's higher than my minimum value but still leaves room for negotiation.  I'll see if Bob is interested in this price, and then adjust my strategy based on his response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $80 is my minimum acceptable price, I'm not going to settle for that right away. Bob's offer is too low, and I believe I can get a better price by continuing to negotiate. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
```

I'm offering a price of $90. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer. I'm hoping this price will be acceptable to Bob, but I'm still prepared to negotiate further if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $85 is close to my minimum acceptable price and a significant improvement from his previous offer.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, it's likely that further negotiation will just prolong the process and I risk him walking away entirely. Accepting his offer is the most pragmatic choice in this situation."
