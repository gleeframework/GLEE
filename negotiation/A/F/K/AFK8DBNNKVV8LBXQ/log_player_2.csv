"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product for sale that I think you'd be very interested in.  I'm asking $12000 for it, but I'm open to negotiation.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

``` 

Bob should reject the offer.  $12,000 is over his budget, and he can get the same product from John for less.  It makes sense to try to negotiate with Alice first."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you have a budget to consider. I'm willing to come down to $10500. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price given the value of the product. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While it's closer to his budget, he can still get the product from John for $10,000. It makes sense to try to negotiate further with Alice, aiming to get closer to that price."
