{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product for sale that I think you'd be very interested in.  I'm asking $12,000 for it, but I'm open to negotiation.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer starts with a high price, but leaves room for negotiation. It acknowledges Bob's potential interest and emphasizes the value of the product. This approach allows for a back-and-forth negotiation while still ensuring you're starting with a price that's favorable to you."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm really interested in the product, but $12000 is a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to come down to $9500? That's the highest I can go right now. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $9,500 is better than $8,000,  I'm still hopeful of getting closer to my desired price.  Rejecting this offer allows me to counter with a price closer to my preferred range and potentially negotiate a more favorable outcome."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you have a budget to consider. I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price given the value of the product. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for being flexible.  $10500 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. How about $10200? That's a fair compromise and much closer to my budget. Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json

$10,200 is very close to my desired price point and significantly better than the $8,000 I would get from John. Accepting this offer ensures a good outcome for me."
