"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I believe a starting price of $1,800,000 is fair. What do you think?",1800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,800,000 is significantly above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product, which is the maximum I can afford.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,200,000 is below the true value of this product. Let's meet in the middle - how about $1,500,000?",1500000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $1,500,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,350,000, which is a fair compromise.  Let's close this deal.",1350000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  How about we split the difference and settle at $1,425,000? This would be a win-win for both of us.",1425000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm feeling like we're close. Let's try $1,400,000 as a final offer.  This is my absolute maximum, so I hope you'll consider it.",1400000.0,Bob,6,
