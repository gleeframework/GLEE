"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's too early to buy from Alice, as her offer is significantly higher than your target price. You should try to negotiate a lower price first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000}
```

You're going to start with your target price. This is your best possible outcome, and it's still more than what John is offering. It's highly unlikely Alice will accept this on the first try, but it's a starting point to see how willing she is to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Alice has come down a bit, but it's still too high. You should try to negotiate further before considering buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

You're increasing your offer slightly, showing a willingness to negotiate while staying within your budget. This is a good middle ground to see if Alice is willing to meet you halfway."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Alice is getting closer to your target price, but it's still not quite there. You should keep negotiating to see if you can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

You're increasing your offer again, showing a willingness to negotiate while still staying within your budget. You're almost at the midpoint between your initial offer and Alice's latest offer, which could make her more likely to accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

You've reached a point where Alice is unwilling to go much lower, and you've only got a few rounds left.  It's becoming increasingly risky to continue negotiating, as you could end up with no deal at all.  Buying from John at $800,000 is the most secure option at this point, even though it's not your ideal price."
