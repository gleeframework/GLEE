Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting with an offer of $1,500,000. This is a good starting point because it's a significant markup from my minimum value of $1,200,000, but not so high that it's likely to scare Bob off right away. I'm curious to see how much Bob values the product and if he's willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Bob's offer is too low. I'm going to reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm going to counter with $1,300,000. This is still a good profit for me, but it's a significant step down from my initial offer and shows I'm willing to negotiate. I'm hoping this will be a more appealing price for Bob, but I'm still prepared to walk away if he doesn't come closer to my desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is still below my minimum value. I'm going to reject his offer and try one more counteroffer before considering selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm offering $1,250,000. This is the absolute lowest I'm willing to go, as it's just above my minimum acceptable value. If Bob rejects this, I'll sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum value, and I've already made several concessions. I'm not willing to go any lower, so I'm going to sell to John to ensure I receive at least my minimum value."
