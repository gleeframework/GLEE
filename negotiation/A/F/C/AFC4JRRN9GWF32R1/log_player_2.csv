"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which is valued at $100 by you. I'm proposing to sell it to you for $80, which I believe is a fair deal considering its value to you and my goal to maximize earnings. Please let me know if this offer suits your budget. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $80

Alice's offer of $80 is less than your maximum budget of $100 and cheaper than buying from John for $100. This is a good deal!"
