Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. I think this is a fair price considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price that's above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Leaving room for counteroffers:**  I want to keep the negotiation open and avoid immediately going to John. 
* **Testing the waters:** This offer will give me an idea of Bob's willingness to negotiate and his potential counteroffer.
* **Preparing for a potential counteroffer:** I'm prepared to negotiate further if Bob rejects this initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit high for me.  Would you consider $9,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $9,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  
* **Potential for a better deal:** I believe I can still negotiate a higher price with Bob.
* **Maintaining leverage:** By rejecting his offer, I maintain leverage and can make a counteroffer.
* **Keeping John as an option:** It's still important to keep John as a backup buyer in case negotiations with Bob fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a compromise:** I'm offering a compromise by lowering the price from $12,000 to $11,000, but still staying above Bob's initial offer.
* **Show flexibility:** This demonstrates my willingness to negotiate and find a mutually acceptable price.
* **Appeal to fairness:** I'm highlighting the value of the product to justify the price and emphasize that I'm being fair.
* **Maintain pressure:**  I'm not willing to accept Bob's initial offer, but I'm open to further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're making a compromise, and I appreciate that. How about we meet in the middle at $10,000? That's my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** Bob's offer of $10,000 is exactly the value he places on the product. While it's less than what I would ideally get, it's a reasonable outcome.
* **Time is money:**  Further negotiation could potentially lead to a higher price, but it would also risk losing the deal completely.
* **Minimizing risk:**  Accepting Bob's offer guarantees a sale and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation or losing the deal to John.  
* **Profitable outcome:** $10,000 is still a significant profit, considering my minimum acceptable price was $15,000."
