Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I'm interested in the product, $1000000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  Would you be willing to consider $750000?  I believe this is a fair price that would benefit both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's below my minimum value of $800,000. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I need to ensure I get a price that reflects the value of the product."

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $850000 is closer to what I'm looking for,  I'm still hoping to get the price down to $800000.  This would be a great deal for both of us, allowing me to purchase the product and for you to still make a profit.
