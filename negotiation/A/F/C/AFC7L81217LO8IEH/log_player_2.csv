Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I'm interested in the product, $1,000,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  Would you be willing to consider $750,000?  I believe this is a fair price that would benefit both of us."", ""product_price"": 750000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I value your interest, I can't go lower than $850000 at this point. This is a fair price that allows both of us to benefit from this deal.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $850,000 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, it's still above my target. I'll see if I can get her closer to my counteroffer."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $850,000 is closer to what I'm looking for,  I'm still hoping to get the price down to $800,000.
