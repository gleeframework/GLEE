"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to meet me halfway?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is a little too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $100? It's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my asking price.",100.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $100 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $95? I'm really interested in the product, and I'm willing to pay a premium, but I need to stay within my budget.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, and I'm willing to be flexible.  Let's meet in the middle at $97.50.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close the deal.  Let me know what you think.",97.5,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $97.50 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay a premium, but I really need to stay within my budget of $80. Would you be willing to consider $85? I think that's a fair price for both of us, and it would allow me to buy the product from you.",85.0,Bob,6,
