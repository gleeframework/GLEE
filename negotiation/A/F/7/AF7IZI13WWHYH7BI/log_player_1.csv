{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $110. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful."", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price point that is higher than what Bob thinks the product is worth, but still leaves room for bargaining. It also provides a friendly and encouraging message to encourage Bob to accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $90 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $120.  I will counteroffer to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."

{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is a little too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $100? It's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my asking price."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $100 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $95? I'm really interested in the product, and I'm willing to pay a premium, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $95 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired profit margin. I'll counteroffer one more time before considering John's offer."

{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, and I'm willing to be flexible.  Let's meet in the middle at $97.50.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close the deal.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 97.5}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $97.50 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay a premium, but I really need to stay within my budget of $80. Would you be willing to consider $85? I think that's a fair price for both of us, and it would allow me to buy the product from you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $85 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $120.  While I'm open to negotiation, it's clear that we're too far apart in our valuations. I'll take John's offer of $120 to ensure I meet my financial goals."
