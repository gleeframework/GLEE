"I appreciate your product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $12,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $16,000,  which is still a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $16,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $14,000. Can we discuss further?",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to keep negotiating.  $14,000 is closer, but I'm still hoping for a little more. I'm willing to go down to $15,500.  It's a fair compromise that allows us both to get what we want. Let's make a deal!",15500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $15,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $14,500. Can we meet in the middle?",14500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm getting the feeling we're both very close to a deal.  I'm going to make one final offer.  How about $15,000?  That's my absolute bottom line, but it's a fair price for both of us.  Let's shake hands and be done with this! ",15000.0,Alice,7,
