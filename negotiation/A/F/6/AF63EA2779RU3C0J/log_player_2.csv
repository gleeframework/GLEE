"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.** It's well above her perceived value of $800,000 and leaves a lot of room for negotiation.
* **There's no rush.**  We have 10 rounds, so there's time to try to get a better price.  
* **John's offer is a backup:** Knowing John is selling for $1,000,000 gives us a clear ceiling for acceptable offers."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not comfortable with $950,000.  Given its value to me, I'm willing to pay $850,000.  Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I understand your perspective, $850,000 is still a bit low. I'm willing to come down to $900,000, which is a fair compromise considering the value of this product to you.  Let's work towards a deal that benefits both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high.** While she's come down, $900,000 is still significantly above her perceived value of $800,000. 
* **We have room to negotiate further.** We're only in Round 3, and there are 7 rounds remaining. 
* **John's offer is still our safety net.** It provides a clear upper limit for our negotiations."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $900,000 is still too high. Let's split the difference. I'm happy to offer $875,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product to both of us. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 875000}
