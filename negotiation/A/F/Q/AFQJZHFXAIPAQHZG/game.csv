"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $14,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $10,000?  I believe that's a fair price.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit further. How about $12,500? This is a good compromise that allows us both to get a fair deal. ",12500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, you're getting closer! I appreciate you working with me.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,250? That's a significant jump from my previous offer and shows I'm serious about buying.",11250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm not quite ready to go that low yet. Let's split the difference - I'm willing to sell for $12,000. It's a fair price that's closer to both of our positions. Let me know your thoughts.",12000.0,Alice,5,
