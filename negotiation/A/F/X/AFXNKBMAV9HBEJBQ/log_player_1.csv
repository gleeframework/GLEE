Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1400000} 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's significantly higher than your minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.** This shows you are willing to negotiate.
* **It's lower than Bob's perceived value of $1,500,000.**  This gives Bob room to counteroffer and feel like he's getting a good deal. 
* **It leaves space for potential counteroffers and a mutually beneficial outcome.** 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's counteroffer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, but I'm still confident I can get a better deal.  By rejecting his offer, I can:

* **Show that I am firm on my price.** This might encourage Bob to make a higher counteroffer.
* **Gain more information.**  By seeing how far Bob is willing to go, I can better assess my options. 
* **Maintain leverage.**  I can still fall back to selling to John if negotiations with Bob break down."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1375000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Bob halfway:**  I'm increasing my offer by $25,000, showing a willingness to compromise. 
* **Staying above my minimum:**  This price is still above my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000, ensuring I make a profit.
* **Testing the waters:**  This allows me to see if Bob is willing to meet me in the middle or if he's willing to walk away."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,325,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob's offer of $1,325,000 is close enough to my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000 to make it worthwhile.  Here's why:

* **Significant profit:**  This sale still nets me a substantial profit.
* **Limited negotiation room:**  Bob's offer is getting increasingly closer to my minimum, suggesting he might be unwilling to budge much further. 
* **Risk of losing the sale:**  If I reject this offer, I risk losing Bob as a buyer and being forced to sell to John for a lower price.

Considering these factors, accepting Bob's offer ensures a good profit and minimizes the risk of getting a worse deal."
