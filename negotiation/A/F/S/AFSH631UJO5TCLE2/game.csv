"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it has immense value and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's worth to you is $1,500,000. I'm open to negotiating further, but I'm looking to make a good profit. What are your thoughts?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product is valuable, I'm aiming for a price closer to $900,000. This feels like a fair starting point considering my budget. What do you think?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still looking to make a good profit. Considering the product's worth to you is $1,500,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $1,100,000. This is a fair price that balances our interests. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $1,100,000 is closer, but still a bit high for me. How about we settle at $975,000? This keeps us both reasonably close to our initial targets.",975000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm still not willing to go below $1,050,000. This is the minimum I'm comfortable with, considering the product's value to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to maintain a reasonable profit margin. I'm counteroffering at $1,025,000. Let me know what you think.",1025000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting close.  I can see you're firm on that $1,025,000, but I'm hoping we can find a compromise.  How about $1,000,000 even? That feels like a fair middle ground we can both agree on.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
