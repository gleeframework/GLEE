"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly less than what it's worth to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $10,000 is a good deal, it's still more than the product is worth to Alice ($8,000). There's room for negotiation, and rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $10,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product. This would still be a good deal for you, as it's more than what you value it at. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still aiming for a bit higher.  $9500 is a fair price that reflects the value of the product for both of us. Let's meet in the middle and close this deal. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is closer to Bob's target:** $9,500 is only $500 more than Bob's last offer of $9,000,  bringing them closer to a deal.
* **Value for Bob:** $9,500 is still significantly less than what Bob is willing to pay for the product from John ($12,000).
* **Risk of losing the deal:**  If Bob continues to reject offers, he risks Alice becoming less willing to negotiate and potentially walking away. This could lead to Bob having to buy from John at a higher price.

By accepting this offer, Bob secures a good deal that saves him a significant amount of money compared to buying from John."
