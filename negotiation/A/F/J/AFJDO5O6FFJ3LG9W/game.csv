"I'm really interested in the product, but $1,600,000 is out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I'd be willing to pay that amount for the product.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and offer.  While I understand your perspective, the product's intrinsic value and potential warrant a higher price. I'm willing to come down to $1,450,000. I believe this revised offer represents a fair deal for both of us.",1450000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $1,450,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $1,250,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
