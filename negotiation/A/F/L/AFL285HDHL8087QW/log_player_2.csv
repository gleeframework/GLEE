"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. My initial offer is $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's better to reject the offer and see if you can get a lower price. You can offer a lower counteroffer and see if Alice is willing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. While I'm interested, $1,100,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. "", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $950,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $1,025,000. This is a compromise that I'm comfortable with, and I believe it's still a good deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
It's still a little high.  I can get a better deal from John, and I still have a few more rounds to negotiate with Alice.  I'll counter with a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $1,025,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $975,000 for the product.  This is a fair price that reflects the product's value to me, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us.  I hope we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 975000}

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm starting to feel that we're getting a bit far apart. I'm willing to make another compromise, but I need to be closer to my minimum price. I'm thinking of a price of $1,075,000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's value to me, and I hope we can meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's offer is still too high.  While I have more rounds,  I am close to the price of John's offer and risk Alice's asking price rising again.  I will buy from John now."
