"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $1,025,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $975,000 for the product.  This is a fair price that reflects the product's value to me, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us.  I hope we can come to an agreement.",975000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm starting to feel that we're getting a bit far apart. I'm willing to make another compromise, but I need to be closer to my minimum price. I'm thinking of a price of $1,075,000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's value to me, and I hope we can meet in the middle.",1075000.0,Alice,5,
