"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
```

I'm starting with a high price, knowing it's likely to be rejected. This gives me information about Bob's potential interest and allows for negotiation.  I'm also setting a clear baseline to gauge his counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,200,000 is above my minimum, I believe I can do better. Bob's offer indicates he's interested, but I want to explore if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

I'm moving slightly closer to Bob's offer, but still maintaining a substantial profit. This shows flexibility while indicating I'm not desperate to sell at his initial price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob is stubbornly sticking to $1,200,000. While that's a decent offer, I still have room to negotiate and hope to get closer to my target price.  I'm not ready to sell to John yet, as I believe I can get a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

I'm decreasing my offer again, but still holding firm on a price that's well above my minimum. This demonstrates a willingness to negotiate but also sets a clear boundary. I'm hoping Bob will recognize that further negotiation is necessary for us to reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, but it's still not ideal.  I'm going to reject his offer and see if he's willing to increase his price.  It's becoming a bit risky, but I believe I can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

I'm taking a significant step towards Bob's offer, but still maintaining a substantial profit margin.  This is my last serious counteroffer. If Bob doesn't budge, I'll likely sell to John in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is clearly unwilling to budge on his price. It's becoming increasingly unlikely that he'll offer a price that meets my minimum requirements, and I'm running out of rounds.  To avoid losing out on a guaranteed profit, I'm going to sell the product to John."
