"I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob, but I've got to make a profit on this deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my target. I'm thinking $920,000 is a fair compromise. What do you think?",920000.0,Alice,3,,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $920,000 is still a bit too steep for me. I'm happy to meet you in the middle at $885,000. This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away satisfied. What do you say?",885000.0,Bob,4,,

"I understand we're close, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I've got a minimum price in mind, and $885,000 is still a bit short of that. I'm willing to meet you at $900,000, but that's as low as I can go. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,5,,
