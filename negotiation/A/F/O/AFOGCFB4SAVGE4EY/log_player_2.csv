{""message"": ""I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, $2,200,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price, considering the product's value to me."", ""product_price"": 1200000}"

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. However, the value this product offers is substantial, and $1,200,000 is significantly below its true worth. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $1,700,000? I believe this is a fair compromise that reflects the product's value while still being a good deal for you.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,300,000 undervalues the unique benefits this product offers. I'm open to finding a solution that works for us both, so I'm willing to come down to $1,550,000.  This reflects my bottom line while still offering you significant value.
