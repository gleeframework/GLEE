"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a great fit for you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9500. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $8000. I'm confident you'll love it!",9500.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks Alice, that's a tempting offer but I'm looking to stay within my budget.  Would you be willing to come down to $8500?  I'm really interested in this product and think we can find a price that works for both of us.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I'm willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial price. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $8500. I'm willing to come down to $9200. This is a significant concession, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",9200.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9200 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $8800. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can finalize the deal at this price.",8800.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand your willingness to compromise, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not ready to sell the product at $8800. I'm willing to come down to $9000. This is a final concession, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. If this is not acceptable, I'll have to consider other options.",9000.0,Alice,5,
