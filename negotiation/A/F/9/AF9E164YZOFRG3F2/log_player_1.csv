"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
```

I'm starting high, at $20,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value of $15,000. I'm hoping to gauge Bob's interest and see how high he's willing to go. If he rejects, I'll be prepared to negotiate down, but I want to establish a high starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $15,000 is my minimum, I'm not in a rush to sell.  I want to see if Bob is willing to go higher.  I'm going to reject his offer and counter in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
```

I'm going to counter with $18,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's lowball offer.  I'm hoping this shows him that I'm willing to negotiate, but that I still value the product at a higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob is starting to get closer to my desired price. While $16,000 isn't ideal, it's above my minimum and a reasonable compromise. I'm going to accept his offer and close the deal. There's no guarantee I'll get a better offer in the next round, and I don't want to risk losing a sale altogether."
