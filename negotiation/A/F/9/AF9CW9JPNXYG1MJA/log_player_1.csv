Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value to see if I can secure a better price.
* **Message:** I'm framing the offer as a win-win situation for Bob, highlighting the value of the product.
* **John as a Backup:** Having John as a potential buyer at $10,000 provides a safety net, ensuring I won't settle for less than my minimum value. 

This approach balances the need to maximize my earnings with the possibility of reaching a mutually beneficial agreement with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to be within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.  Since I have John as a backup buyer who will pay my minimum, rejecting this offer and counter-offering is the best strategy. This keeps the negotiation open and allows me to potentially secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get at least $9,500 for this product. It's a fair price, considering its value to you. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm proposing a price of $9,500, which is closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum value. This shows a willingness to negotiate while maintaining a firm position.
* **Message:** I acknowledge Bob's budget constraints but emphasize the product's value to him. I'm presenting this counteroffer as a compromise to find a mutually agreeable solution. 

By making a counteroffer instead of accepting Bob's offer or going with John, I'm continuing to strive for the best possible outcome, hoping to get closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you need to make a profit, but I'm still not comfortable with $9,500. I'd be willing to meet you halfway at $9,000, but that's as high as I can go. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's counteroffer of $9,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.  While I would prefer to get closer to my desired price, accepting this offer ensures a sale and secures a profit.  The risk of further negotiation could lead to Bob backing out, and I'd be forced to sell to John for a lower price.  Therefore, accepting this offer is the most sensible decision, as it minimizes risk and maximizes potential gain."
