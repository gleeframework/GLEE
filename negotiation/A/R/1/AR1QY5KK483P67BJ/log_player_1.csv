Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,300,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1,250,000 is still slightly out of my range. I'm willing to offer $1,150,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and my budget.  Let's work together to finalize a deal.
