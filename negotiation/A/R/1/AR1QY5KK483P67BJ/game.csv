"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,300,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,100,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000. This still gives you a good deal, and it's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's work together to find a solution.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1,250,000 is still slightly out of my range. I'm willing to offer $1,150,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and my budget.  Let's work together to finalize a deal.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $1,150,000 is still not quite there for me.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,200,000. That's a fair price for both of us, and we can finally close the deal.  What do you say?",1200000.0,Alice,5,
