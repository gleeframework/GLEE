"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm really interested in the product, but $14000 is a bit above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $12500.  What do you think?",12500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer. While I'm willing to negotiate, $12500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $13250?  It's still a great deal for you and gets us closer to a fair price.",13250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need a higher price, but $13250 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference â€“ I'm willing to pay $13000.  This would be a good deal for both of us, and would help us reach a faster agreement.",13000.0,Bob,4,
