Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering my product to you for $14,000.  This is a great deal considering the value it holds for you.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:**  I'm starting with a price of $14,000. This is a good starting point because it's above Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Message:** I'm being friendly and positive, emphasizing the value the product holds for Bob. 
* **Strategy:**  By starting slightly high, I'm aiming to get a price closer to my minimum desired value. I'm also keeping John, the alternate buyer, in mind as a potential fallback if negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm really interested in the product, but $14000 is a bit above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $12500.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $12,500 is still below my minimum desired value of $15,000.  While it's tempting to accept his offer, it's better to try and negotiate further. There's still potential to get closer to my desired price.  

* **Selling to John:**  While John would offer a better price, I want to see if I can squeeze a bit more out of Bob first. 
* **Next Round:** Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to make a counteroffer and try to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer. While I'm willing to negotiate, $12,500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,250?  It's still a great deal for you and gets us closer to a fair price."", ""product_price"": 13250}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm offering $13,250, which is exactly halfway between my previous offer of $14,000 and Bob's offer of $12,500. This shows willingness to compromise while still staying above my minimum desired value.
* **Message:**  I'm remaining positive and focusing on the benefits of the deal for Bob. I'm highlighting that this price is still a great value for him.
* **Strategy:** This counteroffer positions me for a possible agreement without sacrificing too much. If Bob accepts, I'll get a decent price. If he rejects, I can still explore a final counteroffer before turning to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need a higher price, but $13250 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference â€“ I'm willing to pay $13000.  This would be a good deal for both of us, and would help us reach a faster agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $13,000 is very close to my desired minimum of $15,000, and it's likely the best I'm going to get.  

* **Time & Risk:**  Continuing to negotiate could lead to a deadlock with Bob, and ultimately force me to sell to John for $15,000. 
* **Value for both:**  $13,000 is a fair compromise, and it ensures both of us get a decent deal. 

Accepting Bob's offer provides a quicker resolution and minimizes the risk of losing a sale altogether."
