Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm offering the product to Bob for $110. This is a price that is significantly higher than what the product is worth to him, but still lower than my minimum acceptable price of $120.  This gives Bob some room to negotiate while ensuring I still make a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low.  It's below my minimum acceptable price of $120.  I will reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}

I'm lowering my price slightly to $100. This is still a good profit for me, and it shows Bob that I'm willing to negotiate.  Hopefully, he'll see this as a fair price and accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price. While I'm open to negotiating, I'm not willing to go lower than $120.  Selling to John is a better option, as I'll get my minimum price and avoid further negotiation."
