Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly.  Given its value, I'm asking for $12,000.  What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 12000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a better deal.
* **Justification:** By mentioning the ""value"" of the product, Alice subtly implies it might be worth more than Bob initially thinks. 
* **Alternative Option:** Mentioning a public listing introduces a sense of competition and a potential loss for Bob if he doesn't act.

Even if Bob rejects this initial offer, Alice can always negotiate down. Since her fallback option (John) guarantees $10,000, she has leverage to aim higher with Bob."
