Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I know it would be a valuable asset to you.  I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000.  This is a fair offer considering its potential value. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed buyer at $1,200,000, it's always best to try and get the highest price possible. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering a price slightly below my guaranteed sale price ($1,200,000) creates a sense of urgency and potential gain for Bob.
* **Win-Win Scenario:** A price of $1,150,000 allows me to make a profit above Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000) while still being attractive enough for him to consider."
