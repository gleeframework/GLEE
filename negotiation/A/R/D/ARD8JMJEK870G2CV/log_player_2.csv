"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $140. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible.  $140 is still above Bob's maximum value of $150, so it's worth trying to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $140 is a bit above my budget.  I'd be happy to buy it for $130.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 130}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to get the price down as much as possible while still staying within his budget. A $10 reduction from Alice's initial offer is a reasonable starting point for negotiations."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob,  $130 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $135? Let's close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to Bob's desired price.  $135 is within Bob's budget and represents a good compromise.  It's a better deal than buying from John for $150, and there's a chance further negotiation could result in a lower price, but the risk of losing the deal altogether is now higher."
