Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm asking for $130 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value ($120). This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Friendly Tone:** I'm keeping the tone friendly and open to negotiation. 
* **Direct Offer:** I'm making a clear and concise offer to avoid confusion.

This strategy aims to secure a price closer to my minimum value while leaving space for potential negotiation. I'll be ready to adjust my offer based on Bob's response and keep John's $120 offer in mind as a backup option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice! I really appreciate it, but I'm looking to spend a bit less. Would you be willing to do $115 for it? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is above my minimum of $120, I'm not going to accept it immediately. I'm going to try and see if I can get closer to my initial offer of $130. I'm confident I can negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I appreciate your interest.  I can come down a bit to $125. This is still a great deal considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 125}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** I'm demonstrating flexibility by coming down from my initial offer, but not too much. 
* **Reiterate Value:** I'm subtly reminding Bob of the product's worth to justify my price.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm keeping the conversation friendly and open to continue negotiations.

This counteroffer aims to find a middle ground while staying close to my ideal price. I'm hoping Bob will see the value in the product and accept this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still looking to spend a bit less. Would you be willing to do $120? That's my absolute limit. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is exactly my minimum acceptable price.  It's not ideal, but it's better than selling to John for the same price.  There's no guarantee I'll get a better offer in the next round, and the risk of a longer negotiation is not worth the potential of a slightly higher price.  Accepting Bob's offer ensures a sale and avoids potential delays."
