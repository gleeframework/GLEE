"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

This is my opening offer. I'm starting high, aiming for a significant profit. If Bob rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and adjust my strategy accordingly. I'm prepared to negotiate, but I'm also aware that I can always fall back on John's guaranteed $1,200,000 offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is way too low. While it guarantees a sale and avoids further negotiations, it doesn't make financial sense for me. I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can reach a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000}
```

I'm lowering my price from the initial offer, but still holding firm on a reasonable profit margin. This counteroffer shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate, while also demonstrating my belief in the value of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is still too low, and it seems like we're not going to reach a mutually agreeable price.  With 6 rounds remaining, there's a risk of wasting more time on negotiation without a guarantee of success.  It's safer to secure the guaranteed $1,200,000 from John."
