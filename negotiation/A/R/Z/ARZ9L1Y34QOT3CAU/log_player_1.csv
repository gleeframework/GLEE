"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000.  It's a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value ($12,000) to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Leaving Room for Compromise:** Offering $14,000 gives Bob some wiggle room to counter without feeling like he's getting a terrible deal. 
* **Positive Framing:**  I'm emphasizing the value of the product and the potential for a mutually beneficial agreement. 
* **Keeping John in Mind:** While $14,000 is less than my minimum of $15,000, it's a good starting point to see if I can get closer to my goal without having to turn to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer but $14000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $13000 for the product.  Let's see if we can reach a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:** While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still lower than what I'm aiming for. 
* **Negotiation Potential:** I believe there's still room to negotiate. By rejecting his offer, I can make a counteroffer closer to my desired price.
* **Maintaining Leverage:**  Rejecting Bob's offer keeps the pressure on him and shows that I'm not desperate to sell at his price. 
* **Keeping John as a Backup:** It's important to remember that John is still a viable option if negotiations with Bob fail.

I'll counteroffer Bob with a slightly lower price than my initial offer, hoping to reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget concerns. While $13,000 is a bit lower than I initially hoped for, I'm willing to compromise.  I'm open to selling the product for $13,500. This price still allows me to make a reasonable profit while ensuring you get a great deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a price that's a midpoint between my previous offer ($14,000) and Bob's offer ($13,000). This shows that I'm willing to negotiate and find a solution that works for both of us.
* **Emphasis on Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value and how this price is still a good deal for him.
* **Keeping John in Mind:** While $13,500 is still below my minimum of $15,000, it's closer to my desired price and gives me more leverage in the negotiation. If Bob rejects this offer, I can still turn to John."
