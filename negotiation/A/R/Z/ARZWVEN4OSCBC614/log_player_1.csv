Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I make it available to others.  Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, you want to see if you can get more from Bob.
* **Finding a Sweet Spot:** Offering the product at $1,150,000 leaves room for negotiation while still exceeding your minimum acceptable price. It also offers Bob a significant saving compared to your fallback option. 
* **Urgency and Exclusivity:** By highlighting the exclusivity and time-sensitivity of the offer, you might persuade Bob to act quickly. 
 
This approach aims to strike a balance between maximizing potential profit and securing a deal with Bob."
