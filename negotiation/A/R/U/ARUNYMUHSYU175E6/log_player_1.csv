Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd really like. I'm asking $150 for it. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This gives you room to negotiate and still achieve a price you're happy with.
* **Potential Profit:** Offering the product at $150 allows for a $30 profit if Bob accepts. 
* **Alternative Buyer:** Even if Bob rejects, you have a guaranteed sale at $120 with John, so there's no risk of losing money. 

By starting with a higher price, you might get lucky and Bob might accept immediately. If not, you can always negotiate down a bit, knowing you have John as a backup."
