"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Since Alice is offering the product for $12,000, which is the maximum you're willing to pay, there's no benefit to accepting her offer. You can get the same product from John for the same price.  Rejecting her offer gives you the option to potentially negotiate a lower price with her or simply buy from John."
