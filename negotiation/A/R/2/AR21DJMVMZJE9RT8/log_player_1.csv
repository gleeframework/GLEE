Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer is significantly higher than my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I can only offer $800,000 at this time. This is the maximum I'm willing to pay. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,900,000 is still too high for me. I'm sticking with my original offer of $800,000.  If this isn't acceptable, I'll unfortunately have to explore other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000

``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is holding firm at his maximum price, which is significantly below my minimum. It's unlikely he'll drastically increase his offer in the remaining rounds.  It's time to start moving towards my minimum to see if there's any flexibility."
