Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you coming to the table.  $900,000 is a significant investment, but the product's true value sits at a higher point.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find a compromise. However, $950,000 falls short of the product's true value and the return I need for this deal. I'm prepared to accept $1,100,000, but this is my final offer.  Frankly, I have another buyer ready to close at $1,000,000, but I value our discussions and believe this product can be more beneficial to you.  Let me know your decision soon.

I'll reject her offer and try to get an even better deal. I'll also keep in mind that she mentioned another buyer is willing to close at $1,000,000, so I'll aim for that price.
