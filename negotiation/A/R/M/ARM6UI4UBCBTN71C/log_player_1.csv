Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

This offer is a good starting point. It's significantly higher than your minimum acceptable price of $800,000, but still leaves room for negotiation. Bob is likely to counteroffer, but it will give you a good understanding of how much he's willing to pay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is higher than what John is offering, it's still significantly lower than what I believe the product is worth. I'll reject his offer and try to get closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer, but I'm still confident the product is worth more than $850,000. This counteroffer is a reasonable compromise and should hopefully encourage Bob to come closer to my desired price."
