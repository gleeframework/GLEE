"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product, but I am hoping to stay within my budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $1,350,000? I appreciate your understanding.",1350000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand your budget constraints.  While I'm willing to be flexible, $1,350,000 is a bit below my desired price point. Let's compromise at $1,375,000.  This still provides a great value for you and allows me to achieve a fair price for the product. What do you think?",1375000.0,Alice,3,
