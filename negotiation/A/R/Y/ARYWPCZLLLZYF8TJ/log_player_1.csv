Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd really appreciate.  I'm asking for $120 for it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** $120 is significantly more than your minimum of $80, giving you a good profit margin.
* **It's below Bob's value:** $120 is less than the $150 Bob values the product at, giving him a reason to consider your offer. 

This strategy aims to start a negotiation that could potentially lead to a price closer to Bob's value while still ensuring you profit considerably."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for offering, Alice! That's a bit steep for me right now. Would you consider $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $90 is a decent profit, it's still lower than my initial offer. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my initial asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming down a bit. How about we split the difference? I'm willing to let it go for $105.  That's still a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 105} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're trying to find a middle ground, Alice.  How about $98? That's a fair offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $98. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $98
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

$98 is a decent profit and very close to my initial offer.  It's time to close the deal."
