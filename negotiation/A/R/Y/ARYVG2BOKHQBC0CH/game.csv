"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate it, but I'm hoping to keep my spending within $12,000. Would it be possible for us to negotiate down to that amount?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $12,000 is just too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $13,000? It's still a great value for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit.",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. While $13,000 is closer to my budget, I still believe we could reach a more mutually beneficial agreement. Would you consider $12,500 for the product?",12500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence. While $12,500 is a step in the right direction, I'm still not quite there. How about we meet in the middle at $13,250? It's a fair compromise for both of us, and I believe it's a good price for the value you'll get from the product.",13250.0,Alice,5,

"Hello Alice, I've considered your proposal and while I appreciate the effort, I'm still aiming for a price closer to my budget. Could we possibly agree on $13,000 for the product?",13000.0,Bob,6,
