Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I make it available to anyone else. Given its unique value, I'm proposing a price of $1,190,000."", 
""product_price"": 1190000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since John acts as a guaranteed buyer at $1,200,000, Alice should aim to get as close to that amount from Bob as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  The offer of $1,190,000 is slightly below Alice's fallback price, leaving room for potential counter-offers from Bob while still ensuring a significant profit.
* **Exclusivity Incentive:**  By framing the offer as ""exclusive,"" Alice adds perceived value for Bob, potentially making him more inclined to accept a higher price."
