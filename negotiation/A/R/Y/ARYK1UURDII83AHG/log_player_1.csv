Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll start by making an offer to Bob. Since the product is worth at least $100 to me, I'll offer it to him for $110.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","Since Bob's offer of $105 is higher than my minimum price of $100, but lower than the value of the product to him ($120), I'll decide to reject his offer and proceed to the next round. I'll make a counteroffer to try to get a better price.

I'll offer Bob a new price of $115.
