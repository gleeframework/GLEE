Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product.  I believe it holds significant value, and I'm asking for $18,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 18000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations with a price higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a higher profit. 
* **Gauging Interest:** By offering a price significantly above Bob's perceived value, you can quickly gauge his level of interest. If he outright rejects it, you haven't lost anything. 
* **John as Backup:**  Knowing you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $12,000 gives you leverage. You can afford to be more assertive in your initial offer.

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters.  You can gradually lower your price, but always keep your minimum ($12,000) in mind."
