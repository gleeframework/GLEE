**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, it's still above your target of $1,000,000. There's room for negotiation. It's worth trying to get a lower price before committing."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,050,000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $1,150,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on it.

Alice's counteroffer of $1,150,000 is still above my budget of $1,000,000.  While it's closer to my goal, I'm still willing to negotiate further.  I'm going to counteroffer again, hoping to get closer to my ideal price."

Alice's offer:

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,125,000 is closer to my target of $1,000,000.  While I'd prefer to pay less, the risk of continuing negotiations is that Alice might reject my next offer, and I might end up having to buy from John for $1,000,000 anyway.  It's a good deal, and it's worth taking the risk."
