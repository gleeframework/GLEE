Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at a price significantly higher than what the product is worth to Bob but still lower than my minimum acceptable value. This gives me room to negotiate down. 
* **Positive tone:** I'm using a friendly and positive tone to encourage Bob to consider my offer.
* **Highlighting value:** I'm reminding Bob of the value the product holds for him. 

This approach aims to secure a good price while leaving room for negotiation if Bob isn't willing to accept the initial offer.  It's important to remember that my goal is to maximize profit, so I'll be prepared to negotiate further if needed, but I also have the option to sell to John for $15,000 if negotiations with Bob become unproductive."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate it, but I'm hoping to keep my spending within $8,000. Would you consider lowering the price to meet my budget? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value of $15,000 and even lower than my initial offer of $12,000. Accepting his offer would result in a significant loss for me. I need to try and negotiate a higher price before resorting to selling to John. 

I will proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer, aiming to find a compromise closer to my desired price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I appreciate your interest, $8,000 is unfortunately too low for me to consider.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $10,000. This still gives you a great deal considering the product's value. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledge Bob's budget:**  I'm showing Bob that I'm aware of his budget constraints, demonstrating a willingness to compromise. 
* **Counter with a reasonable price:** I'm offering a price that's halfway between my initial offer and Bob's offer, showing a willingness to meet halfway. 
* **Reiterate value:**  I'm again reminding Bob of the product's value to him, emphasizing that $10,000 is still a good deal.

This counteroffer aims to find a compromise that's acceptable to both of us while still securing a price that's closer to my desired value. It's important to remain flexible during negotiation, but I won't accept anything drastically below my minimum acceptable value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I still believe that $8,000 is a fair price for this product given my budget constraints. I hope you can meet me halfway. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has been firm on his $8,000 offer, and while I'm open to negotiation, his price is too far below my minimum acceptable value of $15,000.  It's becoming clear that we're unlikely to reach a mutually agreeable price.  Given that I have a guaranteed buyer in John who is willing to pay $15,000, it's in my best interest to end negotiations with Bob and sell to John. This will ensure I receive the full value of the product and avoid further time-consuming negotiations that may not yield a satisfactory outcome."
