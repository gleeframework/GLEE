Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's significantly higher than your minimum acceptable price ($800,000).** This gives you room to negotiate.
* **It's lower than the product's value to Bob ($1,500,000).** This makes the offer appealing to him and increases the likelihood of him accepting.

I've also included a friendly message to encourage a positive negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,000,000 for your product. I believe this price reflects its value to me while staying within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is still significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $800,000, so I'm not in a rush to accept. However, it's also significantly lower than my initial offer of $1,200,000. I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,000,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This is a good compromise that still allows us both to benefit from this deal. Let's work together to find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm offering $1,100,000, which is a reasonable compromise. It's a significant increase from Bob's last offer, but still lower than my initial price. 
* **Message:** The message is friendly and emphasizes the importance of finding a solution that benefits both parties. This helps maintain a positive negotiation environment."
