"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you place on the product, but given my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price closer to $1,000,000. I hope this aligns better with what you're willing to consider.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,000,000 is significantly below its true value. Let's meet in the middle â€“ how about $1,350,000?",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand Alice, but I still feel that $1,350,000 is quite high for me. I would like to propose a price closer to $1,200,000, which is my maximum budget. I hope we can come to an agreement that works for both of us.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
