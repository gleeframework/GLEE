"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this amazing product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to get your hands on this incredible item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,500. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $12,000. What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $9,500 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $9,500 might be a bit steep for you. However, I'm still looking to get a good price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $8,800. This is a compromise that I think is fair, considering the product's value to you is $12,000. What do you think?",8800.0,Alice,3,

"Thanks for the counter offer, Alice.  I'm getting closer, but $8,800 is still a little more than I'd like to spend.  Could you do $7,800?",7800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're getting close to your target price, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $7,800. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer to meet you in the middle. I'll offer the product to you for $8,200. This is my final compromise, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",8200.0,Alice,5,
