"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product for a limited time. It's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $20000. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else. What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but $20000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $8000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $20000 might be a stretch for you, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $8000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $18000. This is a significant discount from the original price, and I think it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $12000 is still a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm willing to make another concession. I can offer it to you for $16000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm starting to think that I'm not the right customer for this product, but I'm still interested. I'm willing to meet you at $14000. That's the highest price I'm willing to pay. Can you accept that?",14000.0,Bob,6,
