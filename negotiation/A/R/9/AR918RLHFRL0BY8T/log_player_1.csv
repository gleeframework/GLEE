Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you might be interested in. I'm offering it to you for $149. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 149}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $150, you want to see if Bob is willing to pay even slightly more.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $149 leaves a tiny bit of wiggle room if Bob wants to negotiate, but still ensures you get close to your maximum possible profit.
* **High Initial Offer:**  Even though Bob only values the product at $80, a high initial offer can sometimes anchor the negotiation and make him more receptive to a slightly lower counter-offer (if you were open to one)."
