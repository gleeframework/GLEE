Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  This would still be a good deal for you, as it's more than you value it at, and it's within my range.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your offer.  I understand your position, but $8,500 is significantly below its true value.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,500? I'm confident you won't regret it."", ""product_price"": 10500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,500 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $9,000 for the product. This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident it would be a good deal for you.  What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000

While Bob is moving closer to a reasonable price, it's unlikely he'll reach my minimum of $10,000. It's time to cut my losses and take John's guaranteed offer."
