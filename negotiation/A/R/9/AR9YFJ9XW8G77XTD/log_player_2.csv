"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you at a price of $12,000. I believe it offers significant value, even beyond this price point. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $12,000 is way above his budget, and he can get the same product from John for $8,000.  It makes more sense to counter-offer Alice or move on to John."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer.  I understand your position, but $8,500 is significantly below its true value.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,500? I'm confident you won't regret it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While $10,500 is closer to his budget, he can still get the product from John for $8,000, so it's still worthwhile to try and negotiate a lower price with Alice."
