"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 115}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $115. This is a good starting point, as it's more than my minimum price of $100, but still leaves room for negotiation. It also gives Bob a good incentive to accept the offer, as he'd still get the product for less than it's worth to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $105 is better than selling to John, I'm going to reject Bob's offer. I believe there's still room for negotiation. I'll send him a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm lowering my price to $110.  This is a compromise from my previous offer and shows that I'm willing to negotiate. It also keeps the price above Bob's offer and above my minimum price of $100."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is below my minimum price. I'm going to reject it and see if I can get him closer to my price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
``` 

I'm going to meet Bob halfway by offering him $105. This is still a good profit for me and hopefully enough to convince Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting too low. I'm going to take the guaranteed $100 from John and end the negotiation."
