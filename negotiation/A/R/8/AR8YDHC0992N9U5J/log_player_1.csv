"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1800000} 
```

I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than my minimum value, hoping to leave room for negotiation and potentially secure a good price.  I'll be watching Bob's response to gauge his interest level and adjust my strategy for the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my desired value, it's still below my initial asking price. I want to see if I can push for a higher price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1700000} 
```

I'm going to meet Bob halfway by offering $1,700,000. This shows him I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm still holding out for a price closer to my initial ask. Hopefully, this will get us closer to a deal in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $1,650,000 is now very close to my initial asking price, and I'm confident this is a good deal for me. I'm going to accept his offer to avoid risking further negotiation and potentially getting a lower price."
