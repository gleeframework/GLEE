Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $1,200,000 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $800,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering the product to you for $1,000,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I think it's a fair deal. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

Alice has met your ideal price. There's no benefit to continuing the negotiation or buying from John at the same price."
