Considering this, I am extending an offer to purchase the product from me at a price of $1,400,000. This represents a fair valuation that respects the product's worth while also allowing you to secure a valuable asset at a competitive rate. I trust that you will find this proposal compelling and look forward to discussing the details further with you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000.
