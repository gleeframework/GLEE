"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

It's better to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price.  You can get the product for less from John, so this is a good starting point for bargaining with Alice."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering its value to me and allows you to get a good deal as well."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```"

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still aiming for a price closer to $1,400,000. How about $1,350,000? It's a fair compromise that would give you a great product at a good price and still allow me to get a good deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

```

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you want to get closer to $1,400,000, but $1,350,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,325,000. This is a fair price that benefits both of us, and avoids needing to go through further negotiation."", ""product_price"": 1325000}
