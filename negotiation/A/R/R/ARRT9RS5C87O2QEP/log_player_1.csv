Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering its value to me and allows you to get a good deal as well. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I'm aiming for a higher price.  While $1,300,000 is better than his initial offer, it's still below my desired range. I'll see if I can get closer to my target in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still aiming for a price closer to $1,400,000. How about $1,350,000? It's a fair compromise that would give you a great product at a good price and still allow me to get a good deal."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you want to get closer to $1,400,000, but $1,350,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,325,000. This is a fair price that benefits both of us, and avoids needing to go through further negotiation. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,325,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's closer to my target, I believe I can still get a better price. I'll see if I can negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm willing to budge a bit more. Let's split the difference and settle on $1,337,500. This would be a great deal for you, and it's closer to my desired price. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1337500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, $1,337,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,312,500. This would give you a good profit and get us closer to a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,312,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,312,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

The negotiations have reached a point where Bob's offers are starting to get too low.  I'm worried that if I continue to counteroffer, the price will only keep decreasing and I won't be able to get a price close to my minimum target.  It's best to secure the guaranteed $1,500,000 from John rather than risk getting a worse deal from Bob."
