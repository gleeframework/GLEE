"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the discount, but I believe we can find a price closer to my estimated value. How about $850,000 for the product? This still allows you to make a profit while staying within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

I'm going to try and get a better price than Bob's offer. I'll counter his offer in the next round."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm still not quite there yet. I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This is still a very good deal for you considering your estimated value. Let's try to reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but I believe we can find a middle ground. Would $875,000 be acceptable for the product? This still gives you a reasonable profit while keeping the price within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

``` 

While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial goal,  $875,000 is a reasonable price considering Bob's estimated value and the risk of continuing negotiations."
