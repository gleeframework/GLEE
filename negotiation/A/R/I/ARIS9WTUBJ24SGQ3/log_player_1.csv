"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $2,000,000. It's a unique opportunity with significant potential value. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 2000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $2,000,000, knowing that my minimum is $1,500,000. This gives me room to negotiate downwards.
* **Highlighting Value:** I emphasize the unique potential of the product to pique Bob's interest and potentially increase his perceived value. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** My message is friendly and open to negotiation, signaling that I'm willing to work with Bob. 
* **First Round Strategy:** It's important to set a high initial price in the first round to establish a strong starting point for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $2000000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $1500000 for it. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Potential for Higher Price:** While Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, I believe there is still room for negotiation. 
* **Strong Starting Point:** I established a high starting point in the previous round, and rejecting Bob's offer maintains that leverage.
* **Exploring Middle Ground:** I'm open to meeting Bob in the middle, but not at his initial counteroffer. I want to see if he's willing to budge further.
* **Negotiation Strategy:** It's better to reject Bob's offer now and see if he's willing to increase his price. If he's not, I can still accept his offer or sell to John."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $1,500,000 is my minimum, I'm willing to come down a bit further.  Let's meet at $1,750,000. This reflects the unique value proposition of this product and still provides you with a good deal.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing flexibility by offering a lower price, but still aiming for a higher price than Bob's initial counteroffer.
* **Value Emphasis:** I re-emphasize the unique value of the product to justify the price.
* **Negotiation Strategy:** This counteroffer allows me to gauge Bob's willingness to compromise and potentially reach a deal closer to my desired price.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still trying to keep the price as low as possible. I'm willing to pay $1550000 for the product. Can you meet me at this price?

* **Negotiation Potential:** I believe there's still room for Bob to increase his offer slightly, especially considering he has been willing to compromise in previous rounds. 
* **Maximizing Profits:**  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to try and push for a higher price in the next round, potentially reaching a deal closer to my desired price.

While I'd prefer to get a higher price from Bob, the risk of losing out on a sale with John is too great. It's time to secure the guaranteed deal and move on."
