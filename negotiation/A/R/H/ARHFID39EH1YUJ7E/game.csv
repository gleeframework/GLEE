"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit high for me.  Would you be willing to come down to $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $900,000 is a bit steep for you, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. How about we meet in the middle at $850,000? I'm willing to compromise, but I still need to make a profit on this sale.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you working with me on the price, Alice.  How about we settle at $750,000? That's a fair offer that considers both our positions.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're still in negotiations, Bob. While $750,000 is closer to my target, I'm still not willing to go that low. I can offer you a slight discount, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for this product. How about we meet at $825,000? It's a compromise that should work for both of us.",825000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  Let's make this final: $780,000.  This ensures you get a good price, and I'm able to get the product at a price that works for me.",780000.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not ready to give up yet. I think the product is worth more than $780,000, and I'm willing to make one last push for a better price. I can offer you a slight discount, but I need to get at least $825,000 for it. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm willing to make the deal.",825000.0,Alice,7,
