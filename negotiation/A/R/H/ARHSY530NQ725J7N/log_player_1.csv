"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price that's above Bob's perceived value ($8,000) but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Emphasis on Value:** My message highlights the product's worth and the potential benefit to Bob.
* **Room for Compromise:** By starting at $12,000, I have space to negotiate down if Bob makes a counteroffer.
* **John as a Safety Net:** Knowing I can always sell to John for $15,000 gives me a strong fallback position if negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am only willing to pay up to $9,000 for it. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  $9,000 is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value of $15,000.
* **Negotiation Potential:** There's still room for negotiation. I can likely get closer to my desired price by making a counteroffer.
* **John's Offer Remains Attractive:**  If negotiations with Bob fail, I can still sell to John for a much better price.

**Next Steps:** I'll counteroffer Bob with a price closer to my ideal range, aiming to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $9,000 is just too far below what I need to make this worthwhile.  Let's meet in the middle - I'm willing to drop my price to $11,000.  This still gives you a great deal on a valuable product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm demonstrating flexibility by moving closer to Bob's offer but still maintaining a price that's more advantageous for me.
* **Reiterate Value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's worth to emphasize that the price is still fair.
* **Pressure Point:**  By offering a slightly lower price, I'm subtly putting pressure on Bob to close the deal before he risks losing out.
* **John as a Safety Net:**  I can still walk away and sell to John for $15,000 if Bob doesn't accept this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $11,000 is closer to my budget, I still believe we could find a price that works for both of us. How about $10,000 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:**  $10,000 is still below my minimum acceptable value of $15,000. While Bob is getting closer, I'm not willing to settle for such a low price yet.
* **Negotiation Continues:** There's still room for further negotiation, and I believe I can push for a higher price.
* **John's Offer Remains Strong:**  If I can't get a better deal from Bob, I can still sell to John for a much better price.

**Next Steps:**  I'll make a counteroffer that's slightly closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum acceptable value. I'll try to find a middle ground that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to continue working with you, but $10,000 is still a bit too low.  How about we split the difference and go with $10,500? That's a fair price that allows both of us to get a good deal. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** I'm showing willingness to compromise by meeting Bob halfway between our last offers.
* **Fairness Emphasis:** I'm emphasizing that this price is fair and beneficial to both parties.
* **Closing the Gap:**  This offer brings me closer to my minimum acceptable value while still leaving some room for negotiation if needed.
* **John as a Safety Net:**  I still have the option of selling to John for $15,000 if Bob doesn't accept this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your efforts in negotiating. I would like to propose $10,200 for the product. This price is within my budget and I believe it's a fair offer considering the value of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** $10,200 is still below my minimum acceptable value of $15,000.  While Bob is getting closer, I'm still not ready to settle for such a low price.
* **Negotiation Continues:**  There's still some room for negotiation.  I believe I can push for a higher price, especially considering John's offer.
* **John's Offer Remains Strong:**  If negotiations with Bob fail, I can still sell to John for a significantly better price. 

**Next Steps:**  I'll make a counteroffer that's closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum acceptable value. I'll try to find a middle ground that works for both of us, while keeping in mind the value of John's offer as a safety net."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up with a new offer.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again, and offer $10,350. This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and it gets us closer to a deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10350}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Continuing Compromise:** I'm demonstrating flexibility by continuing to compromise and move closer to Bob's offer.
* **Meeting Halfway:** This offer is the midpoint between my previous offer ($10,500) and Bob's latest offer ($10,200).
* **Fairness Emphasis:** I'm reiterating that this price is fair considering the value of the product. 
* **Closing the Gap:** This offer brings me closer to my minimum acceptable value, but I'm still not willing to go below $10,000.
* **John's Offer as a Backstop:** If Bob rejects this offer, I can still sell to John for $15,000, giving me a strong fallback position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I've reviewed our previous negotiations and am willing to consider $10,300 for the product. This price respects the value of the product while staying within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,300. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,300
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close, But Not Close Enough:** While Bob's offer of $10,300 is getting very close to my minimum acceptable value, I'm still hesitant to go below $10,350.
* **Risk of Stalemate:**  We're nearing the end of the negotiation rounds, and there's a real risk of reaching a stalemate.  I'm not confident that we'll be able to reach an agreement that satisfies both of us.
* **John's Offer is Superior:** With only two rounds left, I'm better off taking John's offer of $15,000. It guarantees me a much higher profit than I can likely get from Bob at this point.

**Conclusion:** I'm choosing to sell to John because it offers a much safer and more profitable outcome compared to continuing negotiations with Bob."
