Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $14,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $10,000. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $10,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum price of $12,000. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, but I'll need a better offer to consider it seriously."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. However, $10,000 is simply too low for me to consider. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer.  How about $12,500? That's a fair price for both of us, and it gives you a great deal on a product worth $12,000 to you."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. While $12,500 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a touch high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $11,250?  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $11,250 is closer to my minimum price, it's still below what I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to continue negotiating, but I'll need a better offer to seriously consider selling to Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, let's get this done. I'm willing to come down to $11,750. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product for both of us.  I'm not willing to go lower, so I'm hoping we can finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 11750}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. $11,750 is very close, but I'm aiming for a price closer to $11,000. Would you be willing to consider $11,100? I think that's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer of $11,100 is getting closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum. I'm determined to get closer to my goal and I believe I can get a better price through further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand we're getting close to an agreement. How about $11,500?  I've come down a lot from my initial offer, and I'm confident this price reflects the value of the product for both of us. Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is my final offer, take it or leave it. $11,200, that's as high as I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $11,200 is still below my minimum price of $12,000.  Although I've been willing to negotiate, I'm not willing to settle for a price that's less than what I believe the product is worth. I've already negotiated for several rounds, and I'm running out of time. Therefore, I'm going to sell the product to John for $12,000, which is a fair price for me."
