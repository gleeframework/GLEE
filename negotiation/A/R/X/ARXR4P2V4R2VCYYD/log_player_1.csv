"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $950,000 is a bit high for me. How about we settle around $700,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
The product is worth $1,000,000 to Bob, so there's still room to negotiate a better price.  Selling to John for $800,000 is the floor, but I can likely get more from Bob.  I will counter-offer and see if we can close the deal closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $700,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit.  How about we split the difference and go with $825,000? This gives you a significant discount while still allowing me to reach a fair price."", ""product_price"": 825000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $825,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something closer to $750,000. Would you be willing to meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $750,000 is closer to my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price, and we still have time. I'll counter-offer and see if we can bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal. $750,000 is still a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. How about we settle on $775,000? This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us both to reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 775000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you've been great to work with, and I see the value in the product.  How about we make this our final offer - $762,500.  That's a fair compromise, and we can both walk away happy. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $762,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $762,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $762,500 is very close to my floor price, I want to see if I can squeeze a bit more out of Bob. We've both been negotiating in good faith, and with a few rounds left, I think we can reach an agreement closer to $800,000."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I understand your offer is fair, $762,500 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $781,250.  This would allow us both to walk away feeling good about the deal."", ""product_price"": 781250}
