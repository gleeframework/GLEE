"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $10,000. This is a great deal, considering its value to you is $8,000. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $6,000? I think that's a fair price.",6000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $10,000 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6,000. However, I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about we settle on $8,500? This is still a good deal for both of us, considering its value to you is $8,000.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. While $8,500 is closer, I'm still aiming for something a bit lower. Would you be open to $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $7,000. However, I'm willing to compromise a bit more. How about we meet at $8,000? This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and it's still a good deal for both of us.",8000.0,Alice,5,
