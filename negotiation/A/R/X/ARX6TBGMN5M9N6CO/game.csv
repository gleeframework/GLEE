"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. I think you'll find it's a great fit for your needs. I'm willing to start with an offer of $1,400,000. Let me know if this is something you'd like to discuss further.",1400000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,400,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm prepared to offer $1,250,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the value we both place on it.",1250000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,250,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $1,300,000. I think this is a fair price that still reflects the value you'll get from the product.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down in price. However, $1,300,000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm happy to go up to $1,275,000. This is a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it reflects a fair price for both of us.",1275000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $1,275,000, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. I'm willing to come down to $1,280,000, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. This is a compromise, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal here.",1280000.0,Alice,5,
