"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:

You can do better than $100.  You're willing to pay up to $120, so there's room to negotiate.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and get a lower price."

Alice is still offering too much. You can try to get a lower price, but if she keeps rejecting offers, buying from John might be the best option."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:

Alice is not budging much, and you're already at the point where her offer is higher than John's. It's better to go with the guaranteed price from John rather than risk another round of negotiation that might not result in a lower price."
