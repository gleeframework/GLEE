You can do better than $120.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and negotiate a lower price."

This offer is still within your budget and is likely to be attractive to Alice as it is above her minimum acceptable price."

While $130 is better than $150, there is still room for negotiation.  Let's see if we can get the price down even further."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $125.

Alice has come down to $125, which is a good deal for you. While you could potentially try to negotiate further, it is likely that Alice will not budge lower, and you risk losing the deal. Buying from John would cost you more.  Accepting Alice's offer is the best course of action."
