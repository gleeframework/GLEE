Round 3
Alice's offer:

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good price, but $105 is still too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $110. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
