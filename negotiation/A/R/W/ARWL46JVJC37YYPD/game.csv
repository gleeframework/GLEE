"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,400,000. This is a competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $1,400,000 is still a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering the value to me, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",1250000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $1,250,000. After reconsidering, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,300,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's true value to you. I'm confident we can reach an agreement at this price.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,300,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm firm on my previous offer of $1,250,000. This is a fair price, and I'm confident we can close the deal at this point.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
