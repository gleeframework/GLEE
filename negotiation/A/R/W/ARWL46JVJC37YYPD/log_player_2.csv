"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,400,000. This is a competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $1,400,000 is better than Alice's initial valuation, it's still above Bob's maximum budget.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $1,250,000. After reconsidering, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,300,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's true value to you. I'm confident we can reach an agreement at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible. While $1,300,000 is closer to his budget, he can potentially get the product for even less by continuing to negotiate.  Rejecting the offer allows him to try and negotiate a price even lower than his initial counteroffer."
