{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,500.  It's a great deal, and I know it will be worth it to you.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14500}
``` 

This offer gives me a good starting point, leaving some room for negotiation while still ensuring I get significantly more than my minimum price of $12,000. I've worded the message to be friendly and inviting, hoping to encourage Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $13,500. I'm interested in the product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is higher than my minimum price, I still believe I can secure a better deal. I'm going to reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  I'm willing to come down to $14,000, which is still a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 14000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting closer to your price, but I still think $13,000 is a more reasonable offer. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $13,500. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $13,500 is getting closer to what I'm hoping for, and it's significantly more than John's offer.  It's a good deal for both of us, and I'm happy to accept it."
