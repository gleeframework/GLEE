Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $950,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$950,000:** This is a good starting point. It's a significant discount from Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000) while still ensuring a substantial profit for Alice ($150,000).
* **Message:** The message is friendly and encourages Bob to consider the offer. It highlights the value proposition for him, making it more likely for him to engage in the negotiation. 

**Reasoning:**

By starting with a high offer, Alice establishes a strong position and leaves room for negotiation. This strategy increases the likelihood of a successful deal while still maximizing her profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to save some more money. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. Can you consider my counteroffer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is still above Alice's minimum acceptable price of $800,000, it's significantly lower than her initial offer and leaves less room for profit.  Rejecting Bob's offer allows Alice to maintain her negotiating power and potentially secure a higher price in the next round.

**Reasoning:**

* **Negotiating Power:** By rejecting Bob's offer, Alice demonstrates her willingness to walk away from the deal if her terms aren't met. This puts pressure on Bob to come up with a more favorable offer.
* **Potential for Higher Price:** There's a chance that Bob, recognizing Alice's firm stance, may be willing to increase his offer in the next round to secure the deal. 

**Next Steps:**

Alice should now make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming to bridge the gap between their current positions while keeping her profit margin in mind."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $850,000 is just a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $900,000? It's still a great value for you and a fair price for me. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 900000} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **$900,000:** This counteroffer is a compromise between Alice's previous offer ($950,000) and Bob's offer ($850,000). It represents a middle ground that could be acceptable to both parties.
* **Message:** The message maintains a friendly and collaborative tone. It acknowledges Bob's desire for a good deal and emphasizes the value proposition of the offer for him. 

**Reasoning:**

By making a counteroffer, Alice demonstrates her willingness to negotiate while also maintaining her position. The offer of $900,000 is likely to be appealing to Bob, as it provides him with a significant discount from his perceived value. 

**Next Steps:**

Based on Bob's response to this counteroffer, Alice can either:

* **Accept Bob's offer:** If Bob agrees to the $900,000 price, the deal is finalized.
* **Reject Bob's offer:** If Bob makes a counteroffer again, Alice can choose to either accept it or make another counteroffer.
* **Sell to John:** If negotiations with Bob stall or become unproductive, Alice has the option to sell the product to John for $800,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to pay $875,000 for the product. Can you consider my counteroffer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $875,000 is still a bit lower than Alice's ideal price, it's getting closer to her minimum acceptable price of $800,000.  

**Reasoning:**

* **Potential for a Deal:** Accepting Bob's offer guarantees a sale and a profit for Alice. 
* **Risk of Losing the Deal:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob carries the risk of him walking away or of Alice needing to sell to John for a lower price. 
* **Limited Upside:** It's unlikely Bob will increase his offer significantly further, making this a good point to close the deal.

**Next Steps:**

If Alice accepts the offer, the deal is finalized, and she earns $875,000 from the sale."
