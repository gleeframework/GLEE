"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $10,000 is too low for me.  Could you do $17,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm seeing the value you place on this product, but I need to get at least $14,000 out of it.  That's my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Reason: While Alice has come down in price, $14,000 is still significantly more than John's offer of $8,000.  It's unlikely Alice will come down much further, and saving $6,000 is substantial."
