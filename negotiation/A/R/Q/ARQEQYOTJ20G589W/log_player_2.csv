Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000.

``` 

Alice's offer of $1,350,000 is still more than you want to pay, but it's closer to your maximum budget. You're likely to get a better deal from John, but there's always the risk of him raising his price if you don't commit. It's better to be safe than sorry and accept Alice's offer, saving a bit of money compared to buying from John."
