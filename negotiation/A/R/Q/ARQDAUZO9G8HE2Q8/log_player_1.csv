"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. I think it's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price that is fair to both of us. It's high enough for me to potentially make a good profit, but it's also low enough to incentivize Bob to consider the offer rather than immediately rejecting it.  We'll see what he says!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $13,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $11,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is better than selling to John, I'm not going to accept it right away. I can do better. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $11,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and meet at $12,000? I'm confident this is a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 12000}
