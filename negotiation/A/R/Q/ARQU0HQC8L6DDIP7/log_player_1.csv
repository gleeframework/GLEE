{""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $12,000. This is a good starting point, as it's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $8,000, but leaves room for negotiation if Bob wants to counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $10,000 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get closer to my desired price point. I will counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm going to counter with $11,000. This is a compromise, as it's halfway between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. It shows that I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm also not willing to sell for a price that's significantly lower than what I believe the product is worth."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,500 is close to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still going to reject Bob's offer. I'm hoping to get a bit closer to $10,000. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500} 
```

I'm going to counter with $10,500. This is a slight increase from Bob's last offer, and hopefully, a good compromise.  We're getting closer to a deal, and I'm hopeful Bob will accept this time."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $8,000. It seems like Bob is not willing to budge any further, and I'm getting closer to my minimum acceptable price. While I would prefer to sell to Bob for a higher price, I don't want to risk further negotiation and potentially end up with a lower price than what John is offering."
