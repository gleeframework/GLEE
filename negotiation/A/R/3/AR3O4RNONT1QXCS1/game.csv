"Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $1,250,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as it allows you to acquire a valuable asset at a price that's still beneficial to you. Let's get this deal done!",1250000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I'm willing to make a deal, but I need to make sure it's a good one for me too.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,100,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. Let's split the difference. I'll accept $1,175,000 for the product. This would be a win-win situation for both of us. What do you say?",1175000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above my target price. I'm willing to go up to $1,120,000, but no more. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1120000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest and your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,120,000 is still quite a bit lower than what I need to make this deal worthwhile. Let's compromise once more. I'm willing to lower my price to $1,150,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and gives you a good deal. I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement at this point.",1150000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I can only go up to $1,130,000. I hope we can find a way to make this work.",1130000.0,Bob,6,
