Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 150}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $150. This gives Bob some room to negotiate while still ensuring I get a profit above my minimum.  I'm curious to see what value Bob places on the product!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json

Bob's offer is too low.  While I'd rather sell to Bob than John,  $100 is below my minimum. I'm going to reject his offer and see if we can find a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm offering $130. This is a compromise, closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum.  Hopefully, we can come to an agreement!"

Bob is unwilling to budge on his offer. I'm not willing to go below my minimum.  It's time to move on to a more agreeable buyer.  John is a safe bet, at least he's willing to meet my minimum price."
