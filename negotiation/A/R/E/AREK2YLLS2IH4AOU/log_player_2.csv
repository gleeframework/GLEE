"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  $75 is a good price, but I want to see if I can get it lower. It's worth trying to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 60}
```

**Reasoning:** I'm starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial price, but still within a range that I believe might be acceptable.  I'm hoping to signal that I'm serious about buying the product but am willing to walk away if the price isn't right."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $65. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $65
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice has come down to $65, which is a reasonable price and a good compromise.  It's still a significant savings compared to buying from John, so it's worth accepting."
