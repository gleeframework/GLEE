"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,200,000 is beyond my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me. Let's see if we can work something out. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'll reject Bob's offer.  While $850,000 is better than nothing, I'm hoping to get closer to my minimum value of $1,000,000. I still have more rounds to negotiate with Bob, and I can always sell to John if things don't work out."

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm still trying to stay within my budget.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm offering $950,000 for the product.  This is a good compromise for both of us, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value to me.

I'll reject Bob's offer.  While $950,000 is getting closer to my target, I'm still within range of my minimum value and I want to see if I can get closer to $1,000,000.  There are still a few rounds left and I can always sell to John if I have to."

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand this is your minimum, but I'm still a bit too far off my target. To make this work, I can offer $975,000.  This is a significant step closer to your offer, and I believe it demonstrates my commitment to reaching an agreement. If we can't find common ground here, I'll have to consider my other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000.

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While it's closer to my minimum, it's still a bit too low. I'm going to see if I can push for a higher price in the next round, and if that doesn't work, I'll sell to John.  I have a few rounds left, and I'm not willing to give up on a better price just yet."
