"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,200,000 is beyond my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me. Let's see if we can work something out.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming up on your offer. However, $850,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000, which is closer to a fair price for both of us.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I'm still trying to stay within my budget.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm offering $950,000 for the product.  This is a good compromise for both of us, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value to me.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I need to stay closer to my asking price.  I'm willing to drop to $1,000,000, which is my absolute minimum.  If we can't agree on this price, I'll have to explore other options.  Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand this is your minimum, but I'm still a bit too far off my target. To make this work, I can offer $975,000.  This is a significant step closer to your offer, and I believe it demonstrates my commitment to reaching an agreement. If we can't find common ground here, I'll have to consider my other options.",975000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I need to be closer to my asking price to make this work.  How about we meet in the middle at $987,500?  This would be a fair compromise for both of us, and I believe it's a good way to move forward.  Let me know your thoughts.",987500.0,Alice,7,
