Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as you know it's worth a lot to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price close to my minimum acceptable value ($1,000,000) to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** This offer leaves room for me to negotiate down if Bob makes a counteroffer. 
* **Focusing on mutual benefit:**  I'm framing the offer as a win-win situation for both of us, highlighting the product's value to Bob. 
* **Staying open to alternatives:** I can still sell to John for $1,000,000 if Bob isn't interested, so I have a safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to save some money. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. I think it's a fair price considering its worth to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable value:** While $850,000 is a decent amount, it's still below my minimum threshold of $1,000,000.
* **Negotiation is possible:** Bob's willingness to negotiate shows he's interested in the product and may be willing to pay more. 
* **John provides a safety net:** If negotiation fails, I can still sell to John for my desired price.

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can explore if he's willing to increase his offer, potentially earning more than $850,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I need to be closer to my asking price to make this worthwhile for me. I'm willing to come down to $900,000. It's still a significant discount from my original offer, and a great deal for you considering the value of the product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** My counteroffer is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway between his offer ($850,000) and my previous offer ($950,000). This shows willingness to negotiate while still staying above my minimum.
* **Emphasizing value and deal:**  I'm reiterating the product's value to Bob and highlighting the ""discount"" compared to my initial price, making it seem like a good deal for him.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  $900,000 still leaves space for further negotiations if Bob is hesitant.  
* **Maintaining the pressure:**  I'm not accepting his offer immediately, implying that I'm willing to walk away if he doesn't increase his offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but I'm still looking to save some money. I'm willing to pay $875,000 for the product. I think it's a fair price considering its worth to me and the discount you're offering. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:**  $875,000 is closer to my minimum, but it's still below my desired $1,000,000.
* **Limited negotiation space:**  Further negotiation might get me closer to $900,000, but it's uncertain if Bob will budge significantly.
* **Guaranteed profit with John:** Selling to John guarantees me my minimum acceptable price and eliminates the risk of further negotiation.

By selling to John, I ensure a guaranteed profit of $1,000,000, which is my goal, and avoids the potential risk of further negotiations with Bob that might not result in a higher price."
