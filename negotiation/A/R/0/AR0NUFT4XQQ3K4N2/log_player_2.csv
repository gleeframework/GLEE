"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this valuable product with you. I believe it's a unique and lucrative investment opportunity that will bring significant returns. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's value to you, and I believe it's a fair compromise. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $900,000 is tempting, you know you have a backup option with John for $1,000,000.  There's room for negotiation. By rejecting Alice's initial offer, you signal that you're looking for a better deal, potentially pushing her closer to her $800,000 valuation."
