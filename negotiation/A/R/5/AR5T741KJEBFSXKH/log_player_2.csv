"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you the product for $14,000. I think it's a great price considering its value to you, and I'm confident you'll love it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

Alice's starting offer is too high. There's a good chance I can negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $11,000?"",
""product_price"": 11000
}
``` 

This counter-offer attempts to find a middle ground. It acknowledges Alice's offer while firmly suggesting a significantly lower price closer to my target."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer of $11,000. I understand it's a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $13,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is negotiating, but $13,000 is still above my target price.  I'll counteroffer again to see if I can get closer to $12,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. How about we settle at $12,000? That feels like a fair deal for both of us."",

I'm aiming directly for a price that benefits both me and Alice.  This might be my best chance to secure a favorable deal."
