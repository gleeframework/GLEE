"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $105 isn't quite where I need to be. I'm willing to come down to $110. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you say?",110.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but $110 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $107.50, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than that.",107.5,Bob,4,
