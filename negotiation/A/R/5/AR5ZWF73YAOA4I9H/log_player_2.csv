"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob can save money by rejecting Alice's offer and making a counteroffer. While $1,200,000 is lower than buying from John, there's potential to negotiate further and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to save as much money as possible.  Starting with a counteroffer of $1,050,000 is a reasonable starting point. It's significantly lower than Alice's offer, but still above Alice's minimum acceptable price, leaving room for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than buying from John, Bob can still potentially save more money by rejecting and counter-offering. There's still room to negotiate a price closer to $1,050,000, which is significantly lower than Alice's current offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save money. He's already shown willingness to negotiate and demonstrated a lower acceptable price point. This counteroffer of $1,100,000 is a reasonable compromise, closer to his previous offer but still leaving some room for Alice to make a concession."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,400,000 is too high for Bob. He has already tried to negotiate a lower price and it appears Alice is not willing to budge significantly. Buying from John for $1,500,000 is still a better option than accepting Alice's offer. While it is not the ideal outcome, it avoids further negotiation and guarantees Bob will get the product within his budget."
