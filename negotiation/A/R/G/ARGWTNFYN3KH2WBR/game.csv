"Hi Alice, $150 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $80.  Let me know what you think.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $80 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need at least $120 for this.  Let's meet in the middle.",120.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $120 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $95.  Let's see if we can find a compromise.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer, but $95 is still a bit below what I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to come down to $110. This is my final offer, let's see if we can reach an agreement.",110.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your coming down, but $110 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to go to $100. This is my final offer. Let's see if we can make a deal.",100.0,Bob,6,
