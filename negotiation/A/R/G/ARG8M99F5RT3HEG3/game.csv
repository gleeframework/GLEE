"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1200000. This is a fair price considering its value and the potential it holds for your business. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. Let me know your thoughts.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your confidence in the product's value, but I'm a bit concerned about the price. I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $900000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1050000, which still reflects the product's true value. This price offers a significant benefit for your business, and I'm confident you'll see a strong return on your investment. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $1050000 is still out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $950000. This is the maximum I can go, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate.  However, $950000 is still too low for me to consider.  I'm willing to meet you at $1000000. This price is fair, reflects the value of the product, and provides a strong potential return on your investment. If this is not acceptable, I may have to consider other offers.",1000000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm starting to think we're not going to meet in the middle. I'm willing to go up to $975000, but no higher. I'm not sure I'm comfortable going over that price, and I'm starting to consider other options. Can you meet me at $975000?",975000.0,Bob,6,
