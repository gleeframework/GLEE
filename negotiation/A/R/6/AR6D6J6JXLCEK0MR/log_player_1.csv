``` 

I'm starting with a price of $14,000. This is a good starting point because it's significantly more than my minimum value but still leaves room for negotiation and allows me to potentially earn more.  I'll see how Bob reacts and adjust my strategy based on his response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is above my minimum, I'm still aiming for a higher price. I'll reject his offer and send a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

I'm lowering my price to $13,000. This is a compromise, but it's still higher than Bob's offer and closer to my desired price. I'm hoping this will encourage him to accept, but I'm prepared to continue negotiating if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is still below what I initially hoped for, it's getting closer to my minimum value.  At this point, I'm running the risk of Bob walking away completely, or even worse, John might change his mind about the purchase. It's better to secure the sale now and avoid further negotiation."
