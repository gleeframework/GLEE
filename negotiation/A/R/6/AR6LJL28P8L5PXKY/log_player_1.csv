Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you might be interested in. I'm asking for $175 for it. Let me know if you're interested!"",
""product_price"": 175
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. 
* **Above Bob's Value:** While Bob only values the product at $80, he might be willing to pay a bit more if he perceives the product as valuable or rare.  
* **Below John's Offer:**  Even if Bob rejects the offer, you're guaranteed to sell the product to John for $150, so there's no risk in aiming high with Bob. 

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer.  If Bob counters, be prepared to negotiate!"
