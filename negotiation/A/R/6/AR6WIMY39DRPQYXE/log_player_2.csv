"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a steal at $120. I think you'll find it's a fantastic deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's starting offer is way above your budget. You know you can get the product for $80 from John, so it's worth negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $120 is too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $60 for this product."",
""product_price"": 60
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  Negotiation often benefits from starting with a lower offer than your target price. This leaves room for bargaining and signals you're serious about getting a good deal.
* **Ambitious but Believable:** While $60 is significantly lower than Alice's asking price, it's not an unreasonably low offer.  It shows you're interested but want a price that reflects your budget. 
* **Gauge Alice's Flexibility:** This counter-offer will help you understand how flexible Alice is willing to be on price. Her response will give you a better sense of whether you can reach a deal significantly lower than her initial offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $60 is quite low. How about we meet in the middle at $90? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $90 is closer to your budget, it's still more than you need to spend. Alice moving towards a middle ground indicates she's open to negotiation. You're likely to get a better price with another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand we're trying to find a middle ground, Alice. How about $70? That's a fair price, and I'm ready to buy if you agree."",
""product_price"": 70
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Steady Increase:**  Incrementally increasing your offer shows Alice you're willing to negotiate, but you're still aiming for a price within your budget.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  Mentioning you're ""ready to buy"" adds a bit of pressure and might encourage Alice to accept if she's genuinely interested in making a deal. 
* **Staying Below John's Price:** You're still offering less than what John is offering, maximizing your potential savings."
