If you have any questions or wish to proceed, please let me know promptly. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is below your maximum budget, there's still room for negotiation. You can likely get a better price by making a counteroffer."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value of your product, $950,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to offer $850,000 for it.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your interest in our product. We've considered your offer and would like to propose a counteroffer of $900,000. This price reflects the value we place on the product and allows us to cover our costs while still being competitive in the market. We hope this proposal meets your expectations and enables us to move forward with the transaction.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $900,000 is still within my budget and represents a good deal. While I could potentially continue negotiating, the risk of losing the deal and having to buy from John at $1,000,000 is too high.  $900,000 is a reasonable price, and accepting the offer secures the product without exceeding my budget."
