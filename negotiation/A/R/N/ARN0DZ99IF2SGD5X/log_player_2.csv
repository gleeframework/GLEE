**Explanation:**

Accepting Alice's offer at $1,200,000 is the best option for Bob. Here's why:

* **Saves Money:** Buying from Alice saves Bob $300,000 compared to buying from John. 
* **Within Budget:** The price is within Bob's maximum budget of $1,500,000. 

While Bob could potentially negotiate with Alice further, accepting her initial offer is still the most financially advantageous choice."
