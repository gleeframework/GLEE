Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $10,000. I believe it offers significant value at this price, especially considering its worth to you. Let me know if you're interested."", 
""product_price"": 10000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $12,000.
* **Alice's Minimum:** Alice needs at least $8,000.
* **Maximizing Profit:** Offering the product at $10,000 allows Alice to potentially gain an extra $2,000 over her minimum while still leaving Bob with a perceived gain of $2,000 ($12,000 value - $10,000 price). 

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing profit and securing a deal with Bob."
