"Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but $140 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $125. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",125.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and I'm willing to go a little lower. How about $135? It's a great price for such a fantastic product, and it leaves both of us with a good deal.",135.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $135 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $130? That's the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair price for the product.",130.0,Bob,4,
