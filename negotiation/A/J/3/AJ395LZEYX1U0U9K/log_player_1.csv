Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm willing to offer it to you for $120. I believe it's a fair price considering its worth."",
""product_price"": 120
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $150, meaning he'd be willing to pay up to that amount.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $80 from the sale.
* **Maximizing Profit:** Offering the product at $120 allows you to capture a significant portion of the potential profit while still making the deal attractive to Bob. He saves $30, and you make a $40 profit over your minimum.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between a price that's appealing to Bob and ensures a good profit margin for you."
