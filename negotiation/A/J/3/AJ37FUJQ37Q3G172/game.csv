"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,000,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $650,000?",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $650,000 is significantly lower than what I need to accept.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This is still a good deal for you considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand that you're looking for a fair price. How about we meet in the middle at $750,000?  This offer still saves me a good amount compared to your initial offer.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $750,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This price reflects the value of the product and is still within your budget. I hope we can reach an agreement soon.",900000.0,Alice,5,
