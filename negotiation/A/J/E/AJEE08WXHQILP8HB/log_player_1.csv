"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm proposing an initial offer of $1,600,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations."",
""product_price"": 1600000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm beginning with a price significantly higher than my minimum ($1,200,000) and Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000). This provides room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest level.
* **Confident Tone:** The message emphasizes the product's value without directly referencing Bob's potential lower valuation. 
* **Open to Negotiation:**  By calling it a ""starting point,"" I signal my willingness to negotiate and find a mutually beneficial agreement.

This strategy aims to:

1. **Maximize Potential Profit:**  If Bob accepts a price close to my initial offer, it's a highly profitable outcome.
2. **Gather Information:** Bob's response (acceptance, rejection, or counteroffer) will reveal valuable information about his willingness to pay, helping me strategize for future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's quite a bit higher than I'm looking to spend.  This product is valuable, but not at that price point. Would you consider $900,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $900,000 is significantly below both my minimum acceptable price ($1,200,000) and his own stated value ($1,000,000). This suggests:

* **Testing the Waters:** Bob might be trying to lowball me, hoping I'll accept a price far below my actual target.
* **Misjudged Value:** Bob might be underestimating the product's true worth or my willingness to walk away.

By rejecting this offer, I signal that I'm serious about the product's value and won't settle for a low price. I'm confident I can negotiate a better deal in subsequent rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you countering. However,  $900,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth and potential. To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,450,000. This reflects the product's unique value while acknowledging your interest."",
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:** I'm holding firm by rejecting his low offer but demonstrating flexibility by significantly decreasing my initial asking price.
* **Justified Reduction:**  The message emphasizes the product's value while acknowledging Bob's counteroffer, framing the price reduction as a considered concession.
* **Strategic Positioning:** This counteroffer still provides room for negotiation while staying significantly above both Bob's offer and my absolute minimum.

This approach aims to:

1. **Educate Bob:**  He might not fully grasp the product's value, and my counteroffer, along with the message, aims to correct that perception.
2. **Maintain Control:** I'm guiding the negotiation towards a price point that works for me while remaining open to further discussion. 
3. **Signal Seriousness:** By making a strong counteroffer, I demonstrate my commitment to finding a mutually agreeable price without appearing desperate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the value proposition, but we're still quite far apart on price.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,050,000. This is a strong offer, reflecting the product's value while staying within my budget.  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer has increased, it's still below my $1,200,000 reserve price.  His message suggests he's getting closer to his actual budget limit.  By rejecting this offer:

* **Maintain Leverage:** I signal that I'm willing to walk away from the deal if my price isn't met.
* **Encourage a Serious Offer:** Bob's next offer will likely be close to his maximum, giving me valuable information for my final decision.

I'm comfortable taking the risk as I have John as a backup option."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you moving closer to a mutually agreeable price. To be frank, $1,200,000 is the lowest I can go for this product. It reflects the true value and the significant benefits it offers. Let me know if this works for you, as I do have other interested buyers."",
""product_price"": 1200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** I'm laying out my bottom line. This removes ambiguity and signals to Bob that I'm serious. 
* **Justification:** I'm reiterating the product's value but avoiding extended justifications that might weaken my position.
* **Introducing Competition:** Mentioning ""other interested buyers"" (John) creates a sense of urgency and subtly implies that Bob might miss out if he hesitates. 

This approach aims to:

1. **Secure a Fair Deal:**  I'm offering a price that meets my minimum while still leaving Bob with potential gains (considering his $1,000,000 valuation).
2. **Encourage Quick Decision:** Bob is now aware of the stakes and my willingness to walk away if necessary. 
3. **Maintain a Strong Position:**  By being direct and setting a clear limit, I control the negotiation's direction."
