Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer Alice, but $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product. Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""I appreciate your offer, Bob, but $1,100,000 is quite a bit below its true value.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,250,000? "", ""product_price"": 1250000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you value the product highly, but $1,250,000 is still more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm happy to go up to $1,150,000.  It's a fair price considering my budget, and it gives us both a good deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

While Bob is slowly increasing his offer, it's clear it's unlikely he'll reach my minimum price. It's time to cut my losses and secure the guaranteed $1,200,000 from John."
