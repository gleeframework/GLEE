"Thanks for the offer Alice, but $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product. Let me know if that works for you.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your offer, Bob, but $1,100,000 is quite a bit below its true value.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,250,000? ",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you value the product highly, but $1,250,000 is still more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm happy to go up to $1,150,000.  It's a fair price considering my budget, and it gives us both a good deal.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
