"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but I think $1,150,000 is a bit high. How about we meet in the middle at $1,075,000?",1075000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the price. However, the value this product holds is truly exceptional, and I believe $1,120,000 is a more accurate reflection of its worth.  This is a small adjustment that still allows you a significant margin for your investment.",1120000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. While I agree the product is valuable, I have a budget I need to stick to.  Would you consider $1,090,000? It's a fair compromise.",1090000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I'm sensing we're getting close. While $1,090,000 is tempting, I'm holding firm on the value of this product.  How about we split the difference and settle at $1,105,000? This ensures a fair deal for both of us.",1105000.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, you're right, we're close!  I could make $1,100,000 work.  This leaves us both with a little something extra. What do you say?",1100000.0,Bob,6,
