"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $10,000 is a better deal than buying from John, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to potentially get the product for an even lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $10,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $9,000.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 9000}
