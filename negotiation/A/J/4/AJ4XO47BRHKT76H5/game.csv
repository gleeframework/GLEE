"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $75 is a little too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $85. How does that sound?",85.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still interested, but $85 is a bit too high for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $78. Can you meet me at that price?",78.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $78 just doesn't work for me. I'm willing to go down to $82. That's a fair price for both of us, I think. Let's make this happen!",82.0,Alice,5,
