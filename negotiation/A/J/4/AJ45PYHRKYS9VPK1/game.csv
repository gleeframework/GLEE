"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's start with a price of $1,200,000. I'm confident that you'll see the value in this product and be willing to meet this price.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, that price is a bit high for me.  Could we settle on something closer to $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $1,000,000 is a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. However, I need to make a profit, so I'm going to counter with a price of $1,200,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. I'm confident that this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1,200,000 is still a bit too high for my budget.  How about we compromise at $1,100,000? I think that's a fair deal for both of us.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I can see you're willing to negotiate, and I appreciate that. However, I've already compromised by offering you a price of $1,200,000, and now you're asking me to go even lower. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving money on the table. I'll meet you at $1,150,000, but that's as low as I'm willing to go.",1150000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, and I'm willing to meet you close to your last offer. Would you consider $1,125,000? That's a significant investment for me, but I believe the product is worth it at that price.",1125000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $1,125,000, but I'm still not comfortable going that low. I've already made significant concessions, and I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'll make one more compromise: I'll meet you at $1,150,000, but I need you to meet me halfway from there. How about we split the difference and meet at $1,137,500?",1137500.0,Alice,7,
