Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $110. This price is above Bob's perceived value of $80, but below my minimum acceptable price of $120. This gives me some room to negotiate and still earn a good profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer of $85. While it's better than his initial valuation, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a price that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 95}
``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $95. This is a compromise between my previous offer of $110 and Bob's offer of $85. I believe this price is fair for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer of $90. Although it's still below my initial desired price, it's a good compromise and I'm happy to secure a sale. It's important to remember that I'm risking losing the sale completely if I continue to negotiate and Bob decides to walk away."
