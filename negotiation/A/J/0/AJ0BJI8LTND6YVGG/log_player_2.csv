It's not worth paying $110 for the product when you can get it from John for $80.  Let's see if we can get a better price from Alice."

I'm offering Alice $85. This is a fair price considering the product is only worth $80 to me, and she can still make a profit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95

Alice's offer is still too high. I'm not going to pay more than $80 for the product. Let's try one more time with a counteroffer to see if we can get to a price we both agree on."

I'm willing to go up to $90. This is a good compromise, and I'm hoping Alice will accept it."
