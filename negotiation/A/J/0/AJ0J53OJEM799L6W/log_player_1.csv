Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you might be interested in. I'm asking for $170 for it.  Let me know what you think!"",
""product_price"": 170
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's valuation isn't helpful in a single-round negotiation.**  Since you only have one chance to make an offer and Bob can't counter-offer, knowing he values it at $80 doesn't change your strategy.
* **Aim high, but be reasonable.** Starting with a price slightly above your minimum ($150) makes sense.  There's a chance Bob might be willing to pay a bit more, especially if he doesn't know your absolute bottom line. 
* **Leave room for future negotiation (just in case).** While this scenario doesn't allow for it, in a real negotiation, starting high gives you room to potentially lower the price slightly if Bob pushes back. 

**Important Note:** If you had multiple rounds to negotiate with Bob, or if you could send different offers to Bob and John simultaneously, the strategy would change significantly."
