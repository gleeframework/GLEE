"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its worth to you is $1,500,000. Let's make this happen!",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,000,000. Can you meet me at that price?",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your offer. While I'm willing to negotiate, $1,000,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.  This gives you a good deal, and allows me to get closer to my target price.  Let's make this deal happen.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit higher than $1,100,000. How about we meet at $950,000? I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $950,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway.  Let's go with $1,050,000. This is a fair price for both of us and allows us to finalize this deal.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm still not comfortable with $1,050,000. I'm willing to meet you at $980,000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal.",980000.0,Bob,6,
