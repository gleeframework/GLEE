"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am delighted to present you with an extraordinary opportunity to acquire a unique product that holds immense value to me. This product is not just an item; it's a symbol of excellence and innovation. I believe its true worth exceeds $1000000, but considering the current market conditions and the effort put into its creation, I am offering it to you at a special price of $950000. This is a chance to own something truly exceptional at a fraction of its intrinsic value. Please let me know if you would like to discuss this further or if you have any questions about the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000.
