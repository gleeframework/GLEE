Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $19,000. It's a unique item that I believe you'll find valuable."", 
""product_price"": 19000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing your minimum:** You have a safety net with John ($15,000), so you don't need to accept anything less.
* **Aiming high:** Starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($10,000) allows room for negotiation. 
* **Justification:** The message subtly implies the product's value might be higher than Bob realizes.
* **Potential for profit:** If Bob accepts the $19,000 offer, you've maximized your potential profit. 
* **No risk of losing John:**  If Bob rejects the offer, you can still sell to John at your minimum acceptable price."
