Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll start by making an offer to Bob. Since the product is worth at least $1,500,000 to me, I'll aim to get as close to that value as possible while still leaving some room for negotiation.

Here's my initial offer:

{""product_price"": $1,400,000}

This is a relatively high offer, but I'm willing to compromise to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's see how Bob responds!"
