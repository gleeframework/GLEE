"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts on it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but I think $1,200,000 is a little high. How about we start at $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $800,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer you the product for $1,100,000. I think this is a fair price considering its value to you.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you meeting me a bit, Alice. How about we settle at $950,000? I think that's a fair compromise.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $950,000. I can do $1,050,000, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. I think it's a great deal for both of us at this price.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting close. I'm willing to come up a bit to $980,000.  Let's make this deal happen - it's a win-win for both of us.",980000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your enthusiasm, Bob, but I'm still a bit short of my target. I can do $1,050,000, but I'd rather not go any higher. Let's see if we can meet in the middle. I'll offer it to you for $1,015,000. It's a fair price, and I think you'll find it's worth it.",1015000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm feeling the pressure with only a few rounds left.  I'm willing to offer $1,000,000 even to get this finalized. This is my final offer.",1000000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to accept $1,000,000. I think the product is worth more to you than that. I'm willing to make one final offer: $1,050,000. This is my last chance to get a good deal, and I'm confident you'll find it's worth it.",1050000.0,Alice,9,
