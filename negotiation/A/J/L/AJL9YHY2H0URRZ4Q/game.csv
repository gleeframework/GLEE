"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $75 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's try $82.50.  This would be a fair price for both of us.",82.5,Alice,5,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I'm willing to come down a bit.  Let's split the difference and go with $80.  This is a good price for both of us, and it avoids further negotiation.",80.0,Alice,7,
