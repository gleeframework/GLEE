"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $8500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to stay above $9000 to make this worthwhile. How about $9200? It's a fair price that allows us both to get a good deal.",9200.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $9200 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $9100? I'm willing to make a serious commitment to buy the product if we can agree on this price.",9100.0,Bob,4,
