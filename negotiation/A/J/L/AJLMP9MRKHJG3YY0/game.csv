"I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit overpriced. I'm willing to pay $850000 for it. I believe it's a great deal, and I'm willing to compromise to make it work.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob, but I'm afraid $850000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. How about we discuss a price of $900000? I think that's a fair compromise that works for both of us.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to pay $875000 for the product. I think it's a fair compromise that's close to your original offer, but still a bit more reasonable for me.",875000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're still a bit hesitant, Bob, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I can do $887500, which is as close to $900000 as I'm willing to go. I think this is a fair price that reflects the product's value, and I'm hoping you'll find it acceptable.",875000.0,Alice,5,
