"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you starting the conversation.  While I see the value in the product, $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'm prepared to offer $750,000.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. I understand that $750,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $850,000. Let me know if this is more to your liking.",850000.0,Alice,3,
