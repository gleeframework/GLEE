"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to purchase a high-value product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. I'm willing to start the negotiation with a price of $900,000. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's initial offer is enticing, it's still too high. There's room for negotiation, and rejecting the offer allows me to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a better price.  I want to see if I can get closer to my target price before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you starting the conversation.  While I see the value in the product, $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'm prepared to offer $750,000.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive Counter:** This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial price. It shows I'm serious about saving money and pushes Alice to consider a lower price.
* **Reasoning:** The message provides a polite but firm reason for the counteroffer. It acknowledges the product's value while highlighting my budget constraints.
* **Middle Ground:** $750,000 is a significant jump from Alice's minimum but still leaves room for further negotiation. It's a good starting point for finding a compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. I understand that $750,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $850,000. Let me know if this is more to your liking. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Progress:** Alice has moved significantly closer to my desired price range.
* **Value:** While $850,000 is still above my ideal price, it's considerably lower than John's offer and leaves room for future savings if I can negotiate further.
* **Risk:** Continuing to negotiate risks reaching a stalemate or running out of rounds. Accepting this offer secures the product at a reasonable price, and I can always look for ways to save more later."
