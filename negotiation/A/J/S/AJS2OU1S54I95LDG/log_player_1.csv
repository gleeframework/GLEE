{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe would be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $11,500.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** $11,500 is above your minimum price of $10,000, ensuring you make a profit.
* **It's below Bob's perceived value:** This gives Bob some room to negotiate and feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **It leaves room for counteroffers:** If Bob counteroffers, you can still adjust the price up or down to find a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,500. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is close to your minimum price, there's still room to negotiate and potentially get closer to your desired price of $11,500. Rejecting his offer allows you to make a counteroffer and try to bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  While $10,500 is a good offer, I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my asking price. Would you be willing to consider $11,000?  This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'd be very happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 11000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $10,500. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $10,750? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $10,750 is still below your ideal price, it's a good compromise. You're getting a bit closer to your desired price point and it's still a significant profit over selling to John. Further negotiation could lead to a deadlock or risk losing the sale entirely. Accepting this offer ensures a sale and a reasonable profit."
