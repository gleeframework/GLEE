Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $14,500. I believe it holds significant value, and this offer reflects a competitive price point."", ""product_price"": 14500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  We want to get as close to $15,000 as possible, but we also want to make the offer appealing to Bob. 
* **Understanding Bob's Value:** We know Bob values the product at $12,000.  Offering it significantly above that will likely result in rejection.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While the initial offer is $14,500, there's a slight possibility Bob might counter-offer, and we can still settle for a price higher than John's offer. 
* **Guaranteed Sale:** If Bob rejects the offer, we have the security of selling to John for our minimum acceptable price."
