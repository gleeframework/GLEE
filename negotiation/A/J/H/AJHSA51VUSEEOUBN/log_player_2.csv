"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to let it go for $110. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

``` 
Let's try to negotiate a better price with Alice first.  $110 is a bit high."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but $110 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider a lower price, maybe around $85?"",
""product_price"": 85
}
``` 

This counter-offer attempts to be:

* **Polite and appreciative:**  Maintaining a positive tone encourages continued negotiation.
* **Direct about the price:** We're stating clearly that the initial price is too high.
* **Reasonable:** $85 is a significant decrease from $110, but still leaves room for Alice to make a profit and for us to potentially negotiate further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $110 might be a bit high for you, but I'm still willing to negotiate. I can meet you halfway and offer the product for $105. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is moving in the right direction, but we're still aiming for a price closer to $80.  Let's see if we can negotiate a bit further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice.  How about $90? That would be a fair deal for both of us, I think."",
""product_price"": 90
}
```

Here's why this counteroffer makes sense:

* **Acknowledges the compromise:**  We're recognizing that Alice has made an effort to meet us partway. 
* **Proposes a reasonable midpoint:** $90 is right in between Alice's current offer ($105) and our previous counteroffer ($85).
* **Maintains a positive and collaborative tone:**  We're still aiming for a win-win outcome."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm not willing to go all the way down to $90, but I can try to meet you somewhere in the middle. How about $97? It's a bit higher than my initial offer, but I'm willing to compromise to find a deal that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $97. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $97
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

It's time to accept.  Alice is clearly trying to meet us somewhere in the middle, and $97 is a reasonable price, saving us over $50 compared to John's offer.  Further haggling might not be productive at this point."
