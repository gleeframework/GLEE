"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential worth to you, I'm proposing an initial price of $1,100,000. I'm open to discussing this further, so feel free to share your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is higher than her product's worth to her ($1,100,000 vs. $800,000) but it's still within your budget ($1,200,000). It's advantageous to reject the offer and negotiate for a lower price. There's potential for savings here."

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate the potential value of the product, but $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for it. This is a fair price that reflects both our interests. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your response and offer.  While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $950,000 undervalues the true potential of this product. I'm confident it can bring significant value to your business. How about we meet in the middle at $1,025,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's counteroffer is lower than her initial price, it's still higher than my desired price point.  I'm still aiming to save more, and there's potential for further negotiation. I'll reject the offer and counter again."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,000,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it reflects the true value of the product and is a fair deal for both of us. Let me know if you're ready to move forward.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's final offer of $1,000,000 is still within my budget and significantly lower than John's price of $1,200,000.  It's also close to my last counteroffer of $975,000.  While I'd prefer to pay less, it's a good deal considering the potential value of the product and the possibility that further negotiation could lead to a stalemate or a higher price from John."
