Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate the potential value of the product, but $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for it. This is a fair price that reflects both our interests. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
