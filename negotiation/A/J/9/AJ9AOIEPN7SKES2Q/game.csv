"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the uniqueness of your product, I believe we can find a price that suits both of us better. I am proposing a price of $800000 for the product. I hope this aligns with your expectations.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800000 is simply too low for me to consider at this point. I'm willing to be flexible, however. How about $900000? This gives us both room to compromise and still allows for a mutually beneficial deal.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, thank you for your response. I understand your position and am willing to meet somewhere in the middle. I propose a price of $850000 for the product. I believe this offers a fair compromise for both parties involved.",850000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $850000 is getting closer, but I still need a bit more to make this work for me.  How about $875000? This is a fair compromise that would allow us both to walk away satisfied.",875000.0,Alice,5,
