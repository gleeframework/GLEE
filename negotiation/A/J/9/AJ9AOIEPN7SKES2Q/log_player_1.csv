"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000.  It's a unique opportunity with tremendous potential.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1000000} 
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer, but not so high that it's immediately unreasonable. This allows me to gauge Bob's interest and potential budget.  I'll adjust my strategy based on his response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the uniqueness of your product, I believe we can find a price that suits both of us better. I am proposing a price of $800000 for the product. I hope this aligns with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $800,000 is my minimum, I want to see if I can get more. Bob's immediate offer at my minimum suggests he's willing to pay, but I believe there's room for negotiation. I'll counter with a slightly higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 is simply too low for me to consider at this point. I'm willing to be flexible, however. How about $900,000? This gives us both room to compromise and still allows for a mutually beneficial deal."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your response. I understand your position and am willing to meet somewhere in the middle. I propose a price of $850000 for the product. I believe this offers a fair compromise for both parties involved. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm still pushing for a higher price. $850,000 is closer to my goal, but I believe I can get a little more. I'll counter with a slightly higher offer again, seeing if I can reach a compromise without having to sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $850,000 is getting closer, but I still need a bit more to make this work for me.  How about $875,000? This is a fair compromise that would allow us both to walk away satisfied."", ""product_price"": 875000}
