"Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While I appreciate your offer, $9,000 is simply too low for me. However, I'm willing to be flexible. Let's meet halfway â€“ I'm offering the product to you for $10,500. This price is still a good deal for you, considering the value you'll gain from the product. What do you say?",10500.0,Alice,3,
