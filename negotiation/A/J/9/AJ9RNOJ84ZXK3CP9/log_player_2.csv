"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $100. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is higher than both what John offers and the maximum I'm willing to pay. I should try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $100 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider a lower price?"",
""product_price"": 60
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** I'm starting with a significantly lower offer ($60) than Alice's initial price ($100). This gives me room to negotiate upwards and still potentially get a better deal than John's offer ($120).
* **Polite and Open to Negotiation:** The message is framed politely and expresses interest in the product, indicating I'm willing to negotiate further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concern about the price, Bob. However, I'm still looking to get a good value for my product. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on a price of $85? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above John's Offer:** Alice's new offer of $85 is lower, but still higher than John's offer of $120. 
* **Room for Negotiation:**  Alice's message suggests she's open to negotiation. I'll try to nudge her closer to a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  How about we settle on $70?  I think that's a fair price."",
""product_price"": 70
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference (Almost):** Alice came down to $85 from $100. I'm countering by splitting the difference between her offer ($85) and my previous offer ($60), which gets us close to $72.50. I'm rounding down to $70 to signal I'm looking for a price closer to that range.
* **Direct and Clear:** The message is straightforward, suggesting a specific price point and expressing that I believe it's a fair compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm still not sure if $70 is enough for me to let the product go. I'm willing to compromise again. How about we meet at $78? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $78. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $78
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Getting Closer, but Still Room:** Alice is steadily lowering her price, indicating she's willing to negotiate. However, $78 is still above what I'd ideally like to pay, and it's getting close to the point where John's offer becomes more appealing. 
* **One Last Push:** I'll try one more time to get the price down a bit further before considering John's offer more seriously."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I'm really trying to make this work, but I can't quite justify going that high.  Would you consider $75? That's the best I can do."",
""product_price"": 75
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:** I'm signaling that I'm reaching my limit with this offer. I'm still being polite and expressing a desire to make the deal, but I'm also making it clear that $75 is as high as I'm willing to go.
* **Strategic Positioning:** This offer puts some pressure on Alice.  She's now aware of my budget constraints. She can either accept this potentially profitable offer, or risk me walking away and taking John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to make this work, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not getting the value I'm looking for. I'm willing to meet you halfway again. How about we settle on $80? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $80
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is at Her Limit:** Alice has gone as low as she seems willing. Her offer of $80 matches her product's value to her.
* **Better Than John:** This price is significantly better than John's offer of $120. 
* **Time to Close:**  Continuing to negotiate might irritate Alice and risk losing the deal altogether. It's a good time to accept and secure the product at a reasonable price."
