"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

$6,000 is a great price, but there's always the possibility of getting it even lower.  Since we have 10 rounds, we can afford to negotiate a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 4500}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, dropping the price by 25%. This shows Alice that I'm serious about negotiating and am willing to walk away if the price isn't right."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $5,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $5,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down slightly, but $5,500 is still above my desired price point.  I'm willing to keep negotiating, especially since I have a lot of rounds left to work with."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 5000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer slightly, to $5,000. This shows Alice that I'm willing to compromise, but still want a price closer to my initial offer.  It's a reasonable middle ground that could potentially close the deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $5,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $5,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $5,200, which is a good price point for me.  While I could try to negotiate further, the risk of losing the deal is increasing with each round. I'm confident that $5,200 is a fair price, and I don't want to risk having to buy from John at a much higher price."
