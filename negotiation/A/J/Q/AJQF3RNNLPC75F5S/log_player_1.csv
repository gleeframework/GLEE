Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm asking for $15,000.  What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, I'm starting with a significantly higher offer to Bob ($15,000). This leaves room for negotiation and potentially a much higher profit.
* **Gauging Interest:** The message is phrased to gauge Bob's interest without being overly aggressive. If he's excited, he might accept the offer outright. If not, it opens the door for negotiation.
* **Backup Plan:**  If Bob rejects the offer, I'm secure knowing I can sell the product to John for my minimum acceptable price."
