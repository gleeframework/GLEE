"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference? I'm willing to sell it to you for $11,000.  This is still a good deal for you, and it's the lowest I can go.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above $11,000. I'd be willing to meet you halfway, so how about $10,500? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob,  I understand you're working with a budget, but $10,500 is still a bit low for me.  Let's try to bridge the gap.  I'm willing to come down to $11,500. This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to make a decent profit.  What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,5,
