Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,500,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in this product. Let's work together to find a mutually agreeable price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the value you see in the product, but $1,200,000 is still out of my range.  I'm willing to go up to $950,000, which is a fair compromise.  This offer reflects the value I see in the product while staying within my budget. Let's find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000

While Bob is slowly increasing his offer, it's unlikely he'll reach a price that's significantly better than what John is offering. Accepting Bob's current offer would mean losing out on a potential $50,000 profit. It's strategically sound to cut negotiations with Bob and secure the guaranteed $1,000,000 from John."
