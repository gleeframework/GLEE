Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you first at a discounted price of $135. I think you'll find it's a great deal."", ""product_price"": 135}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally good to start negotiations a bit higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob counters.
* **Finding a Middle Ground:** Offering the product at $135 allows for a price that is higher than Bob's perceived value ($120) but still potentially attractive compared to rejecting the offer and missing out. 
* **Backup Plan:**  You have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $150, so there's no pressure to go below your minimum."
