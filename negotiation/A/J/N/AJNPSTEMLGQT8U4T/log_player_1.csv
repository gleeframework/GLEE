Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm asking for $120 for it. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations a bit higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and gives the impression that the product might be worth even more than Bob initially thinks. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  Offering the product for $120 leaves room for Bob to potentially negotiate a lower price, closer to his perceived value of $100. 
* **Backup Plan:** Even if Bob rejects the offer, you have a guaranteed buyer (John) willing to pay your minimum price. This gives you leverage in the negotiation. 

**Important Note:** This is just one possible approach. Depending on your negotiation style and your assessment of Bob's personality, you could try a different strategy."
