Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:**  You're aiming to get more than your minimum of $800,000.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  There's still some wiggle room for Bob to negotiate down, but the price is still attractive to him. 
* **It sets a strong initial position:** By starting high, you show that you're confident in the value of your product and are not afraid to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm interested in the product, but I have to be mindful of my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

While $900,000 is a decent offer, you can still potentially get more from Bob.  Rejecting his offer allows you to continue negotiating and potentially reach a price closer to your desired $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $900,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This is a significant concession, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value you place on the product. Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $950,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $925,000. I believe that's a fair price for the product, considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $925,000 is a good compromise. It's a significant improvement from his initial offer of $900,000 and is closer to your desired price of $950,000. Accepting this offer will secure a sale at a price that is higher than your minimum and leaves you with a comfortable profit.  Further negotiation might yield a slightly higher price, but there's a risk that Bob will walk away, forcing you to sell to John for a lower price."
