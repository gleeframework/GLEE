"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really enjoy it! I'm asking for $130 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 130} 
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price slightly higher than what the product is worth to me ($120), but still below its value to Bob ($120). This gives Bob some room to negotiate while still allowing me to potentially make a profit. I'm also keeping the message friendly and casual to build rapport."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm interested in the product, but $130 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider selling it for $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $100 is significantly lower than what the product is worth to me. While it's tempting to accept, it's not worth losing out on a potential higher price. I'll reject his offer and continue negotiating in the hope of getting closer to the $120 value or higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $100 is a bit too low for me.  How about $115?  This would still be a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit."", ""product_price"": 115}
```

I'm counter-offering with $115, which is still below Bob's valuation, but closer to my minimum price. This shows flexibility while ensuring I'm not giving away too much. I'm also reminding Bob of the value proposition for him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm glad we're getting closer. $115 is still a bit more than I was hoping to spend.  Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $107? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $107. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $107
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $107 is closer to my minimum price, it's still below the value the product holds for me. I'm willing to continue negotiating, hoping to reach a price closer to $120."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I want to make this work.  Let's split the difference -  $111?  I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 111}
```

I'm offering $111, which is the midpoint between my previous offer ($115) and Bob's latest offer ($107). This shows a willingness to compromise while still aiming for a price that's closer to my minimum.  I'm also emphasizing fairness to encourage Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you're tough! I appreciate you working with me.  How about we try $109 and see if we can close this out? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $109. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $109
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $109 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not happy with the price. I want to see if I can push it up further.  I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting close! How about we meet in the middle again at $110? I'm really hoping to close this deal with you, but I can't go lower than that."", ""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm offering $110, which is the midpoint between my previous offer ($111) and Bob's latest offer ($109). This keeps the negotiation moving while still maintaining a price that's closer to my minimum. I'm also emphasizing my desire to close the deal to create a sense of urgency and encourage Bob to accept."
