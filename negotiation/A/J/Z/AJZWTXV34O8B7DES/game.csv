"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm interested in the product, but $130 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider selling it for $100?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $100 is a bit too low for me.  How about $115?  This would still be a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit.",115.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I'm glad we're getting closer. $115 is still a bit more than I was hoping to spend.  Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $107?",107.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I want to make this work.  Let's split the difference -  $111?  I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us.",111.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're tough! I appreciate you working with me.  How about we try $109 and see if we can close this out?",109.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting close! How about we meet in the middle again at $110? I'm really hoping to close this deal with you, but I can't go lower than that.",110.0,Alice,7,
