"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate it, I'm not quite ready to pay $140. I'm willing to offer you $125 for the product. Let's see if we can find some common ground.",125.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $125 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $135, which is still a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's meet in the middle.",135.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $135 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about $130? It's a fair compromise, and we can close this deal. ",130.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to keep negotiating, but $130 is still a little low for me. Let's split the difference - I'll accept $132.50. This would be a fair compromise for both of us, and we can finally close this deal.",132.5,Alice,5,
