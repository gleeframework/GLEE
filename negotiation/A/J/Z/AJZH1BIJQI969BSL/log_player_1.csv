"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this fantastic product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $22,000. I'm confident it can significantly benefit you."", ""product_price"": 22000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $22,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for it. Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective, but $10,000 is quite a bit below its true value.  How about we meet halfway at $16,000? I'm confident this is a fair price that reflects the benefits it brings."", ""product_price"": 16000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $16,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to go up to $12,000. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement if we keep negotiating. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** Bob is unlikely to meet my minimum price. While he's negotiating upwards, the increments are too small to be worth the risk of losing a guaranteed $15,000 from John."
