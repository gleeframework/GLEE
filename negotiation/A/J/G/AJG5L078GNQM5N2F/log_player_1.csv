"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you my product for $20,000. It's a great deal, and I believe it will be very valuable to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 20000}
``` 

This is a starting point. I'm offering a price higher than my minimum, but not too high to scare Bob off. It leaves room for negotiation and indicates my willingness to compromise.  I'm also framing the offer as a good deal for him, which might make him more receptive."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $20000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $15000 for it. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is my minimum price, but I believe I can get more. I'll reject his offer and see if I can negotiate a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. $15,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $17,500? I'm confident this product will be worth more than that to you in the long run."", ""product_price"": 17500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you at $16000. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $16,000 is a good compromise and very close to my desired price point.  While I could continue negotiating, the risk of him rejecting my offer again or me having to sell to John for $15,000 is too high. Accepting his offer secures a sale at a good price."
