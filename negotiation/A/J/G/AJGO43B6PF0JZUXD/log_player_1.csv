{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that's worth a lot to me. I'm willing to let it go for $9,500.  It's a great deal for both of us, so let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:** This gives him some room to negotiate without feeling like he's getting a bad deal.
* **It's below your minimum acceptable price:**  You still have room to negotiate if Bob's counteroffer is too low.
* **It's a strong opening:** It shows that you're serious about selling but you also value your product. 

Remember, the goal is to maximize your profits.  Keep in mind John's offer of $10,000, but be flexible in your negotiations to see if you can get a better price from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you place on the product. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it, which is still within my budget. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below what I'd ideally like to get. I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can negotiate a higher price.  I'm confident I can get closer to my goal, especially considering John's offer of $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $9,000 is closer, I'm still looking for a bit more to make this worthwhile for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $9,250? This would give you a great deal on the product while still allowing me to reach a fair price.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9250} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. I've done some research and found that the market value for this product is closer to $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $9,125. This offers you a good return on your investment while staying within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I would love to get closer to my initial goal, Bob's offer of $9,125 is a good compromise. It's within my acceptable range, and it's likely that further negotiation might lead to a stalemate. 

Considering John's offer, I can comfortably accept Bob's offer and still achieve a decent profit. It's time to finalize the deal and move on!"
