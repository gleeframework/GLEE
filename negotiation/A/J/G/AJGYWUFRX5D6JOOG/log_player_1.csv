"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $10,000. This is a good starting point as it is significantly higher than my minimum price, but still leaves room for negotiation. I want to see if Bob is seriously interested in the product and willing to pay a premium."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}

I'm countering with $9,000.  This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still above my minimum.  I want to see if Bob is willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below what I'm comfortable with.  I'm going to reject this offer and see if I can push for a higher price in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

I'm going to counter with $8,500. This is a significant concession from my previous offer, but still above my minimum. With only 5 rounds left, I need to start closing the deal, but I'm not willing to go below $8,000 yet."

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $8,000.  We're getting close to the end of the negotiations, and Bob seems unwilling to move much higher. I'm not confident that I can get a better deal with him, so I'm going to take the guaranteed $8,000."
