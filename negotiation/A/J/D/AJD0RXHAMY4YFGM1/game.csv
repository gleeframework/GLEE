"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. As a starting point, I'm willing to offer the product to you for $900,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's value to you, and I believe it's a fair starting point for our negotiation.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product, but I'm working with a tighter budget.  I would be willing to purchase the product for $700,000.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're working with a tighter budget, but I'm still confident that the product is worth more than $700,000 to you. Considering your offer, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $850,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value to you, and I believe it's a good opportunity for us to come to an agreement.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. While $850,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I still think there's room for us to find a price that works for both of us. Would you consider $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to find a price that works for both of us, Bob. I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go below $800,000. I'm willing to make one more concession to try to reach an agreement. I'm offering the product to you for $775,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair reflection of the product's value to you.",775000.0,Alice,5,
