"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $950,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and potential.",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you coming down to meet with me. While I see the value in the product, $950,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'm prepared to offer $850,000. I think this is a fair starting point for both of us.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your position, but $850,000 is a bit too low for me to consider.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $925,000. I believe this price represents a good balance between the value it offers and a fair deal for both of us.",925000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $925,000 is still a bit higher than I can go right now.  I'm willing to offer $900,000.  This price reflects the value of the product while also staying within my budget. I'm confident that we can come to an agreement if we continue to work together.",900000.0,Bob,4,
