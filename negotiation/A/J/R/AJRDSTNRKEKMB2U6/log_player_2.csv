Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your continued interest. While $700,000 is closer to what I'm looking for, I'm still hoping for a slightly higher price.  I'm willing to come down to $710,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product for you, and it leaves room for both of us to benefit from the transaction. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $710,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $710,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

**Reasoning:** 

Alice is steadily coming down in price and we're getting close to John's offer. While we might be able to negotiate a slightly lower price, it's getting risky.  Accepting at $710,000 secures a decent savings compared to John's price and avoids the risk of Alice increasing her price or the negotiation failing."
