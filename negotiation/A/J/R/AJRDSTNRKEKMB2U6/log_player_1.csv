"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $850,000. It's a great deal for both of us, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 850000}
``` 

This offer starts at a price slightly above Bob's value, leaving room for negotiation. It also includes a friendly message to encourage Bob to consider the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a little high for me. I'm willing to offer $650,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. It's better to reject and try to get a better price. I have 9 more rounds and can always sell to John for $800,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $650,000 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $750,000, considering the value of this product to you. This is a fair price for both of us, and I believe we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 750000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still hoping to find a price that works better for me.  Would you consider $680,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $680,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $680,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is slightly better than his previous one, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price. I'll continue to negotiate for a better price,  keeping in mind that I can always sell to John for $800,000. I have 6 rounds left, so there's room for more negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $680,000 is still too low for me. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to lower my price to $720,000. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it a good value."", ""product_price"": 720000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me. How about $700,000? This would be a good deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Although Bob's offer of $700,000 is getting closer to my minimum price, I'm still not satisfied.  I'm hoping to get closer to my initial asking price, and I have a few rounds left to negotiate. I can always sell to John for $800,000 if I don't get a better offer from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued interest. While $700,000 is closer to what I'm looking for, I'm still hoping for a slightly higher price.  I'm willing to come down to $710,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product for you, and it leaves room for both of us to benefit from the transaction."", ""product_price"": 710000}
