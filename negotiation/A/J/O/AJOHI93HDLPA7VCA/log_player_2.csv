"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a fantastic deal considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:**  $1,400,000 is still above your desired price point of $1,500,000. 
* **Potential for a better deal:**  There's room for negotiation with Alice.  Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially get a lower price.
* **John's offer is a fallback:** You have John's offer as a backup option, so there's no immediate pressure to accept Alice's offer."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  $1,200,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $1,300,000? This gives us both a fair deal. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high:** While $1,300,000 is lower than her initial offer, it's still above your ideal price point. 
* **Room for further negotiation:** You can likely get Alice down further.  Rejecting her offer keeps the negotiation going and gives you a chance to counter again.
* **John's offer is a safety net:** You can always fall back on John's offer if negotiations with Alice fail."
