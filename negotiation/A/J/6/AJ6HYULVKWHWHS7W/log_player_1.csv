Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a bit too high for me. I'm thinking closer to $1,000,000. Would that work for you? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  To be honest, I have a budget I need to stick to.  Would you consider $1,075,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is clearly very interested in the product and is slowly increasing his offer.  We're still significantly above John's offer, so it's worth pushing a bit further to see if we can get closer to $1.1 million."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have a budget, but I'm confident this product will more than pay for itself. Let's settle this at $1,115,000 and close the deal."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, it seems like we're getting closer.  How about we split the difference and call it $1,100,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000

{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""

```

**Reasoning:**  Bob is now very close to our desired price point. Accepting $1,100,000 provides a significant profit over John's offer and avoids the risk of Bob walking away in further rounds."
