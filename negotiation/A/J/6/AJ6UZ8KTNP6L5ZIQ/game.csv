"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product, which I believe will be incredibly valuable for your business. My asking price is $1,000,000.  This is a fair price considering the significant value it will bring you. I'm confident we can reach an agreement that benefits both of us.",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but my budget is quite tight at the moment. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $850,000? I believe this would still provide a good return on investment while staying within my financial constraints.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I'm willing to negotiate, $850,000 is a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference at $925,000?  This would still give you a significant return on investment and allows me to get closer to my desired price.  I'm confident this is a fair compromise that benefits us both.",925000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I still need to stay within my budget. Could we perhaps aim for $900,000? This would be a fair compromise for both of us, allowing me to acquire the product without exceeding my financial limits.",900000.0,Bob,4,
