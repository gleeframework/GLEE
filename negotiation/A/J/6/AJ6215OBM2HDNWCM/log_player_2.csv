Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're looking to get closer to $11,000, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'll meet you halfway between my previous offer and your offer. I'll sell the product to you for $12,500. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you is $12,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $12,500. Since you have the option to buy from John for $12,000, it makes more sense to take the guaranteed saving rather than risk further negotiation with Alice."
