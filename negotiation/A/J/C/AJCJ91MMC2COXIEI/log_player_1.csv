Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm asking for $115 for it."", 
""product_price"": 115
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with an offer slightly higher than your target price. This gives you room to negotiate down if needed.
* **Targeting Bob's Valuation:** Since Bob values the product at $120, starting at $115 leaves room for him to feel like he's getting a deal while still maximizing your potential profit. 
* **Alternative Option:** Keep in mind that you have John as a backup buyer at $100. This means you shouldn't go too low with Bob, as you have a guaranteed sale option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for offering the product, Alice. I appreciate your suggestion. However, I am looking to keep my spending within a certain budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's the absolute lowest you'd be willing to accept. There's room for negotiation. By rejecting his offer, you signal that you value the product higher and open the door for a counteroffer that's hopefully closer to your target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand you have a budget in mind, Bob.  How about we meet in the middle at $108? This would be a fair price considering the value you'll be getting."", 
""product_price"": 108
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** By suggesting a price of $108, you're showing Bob that you're willing to negotiate and find a compromise.
* **Justification:**  Highlighting the value Bob will receive helps reinforce that the product is worth more than his initial offer.
* **Leaving Room:** You're still leaving some room for negotiation if Bob pushes back, but you're getting closer to your minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. Considering my budget constraints, could we possibly agree on $105 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close Enough:** Bob's offer of $105 is only $5 less than your ideal price and significantly more than John's offer. 
* **Time Value:**  Continuing to negotiate might not yield a much better result, and there's always a risk Bob could walk away. It's often better to secure a good deal than to risk losing it for a slightly higher price. 
* **Profitable:** You're still making a good profit on the sale at $105."
