{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you.  I'm asking for $11,500.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than your minimum:**  $11,500 is above your minimum of $10,000. 
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  It's lower than Bob's estimated value of $12,000, giving him room to bargain if he wants. 
* **It's a clear and concise message:**  It's friendly, outlines the price, and encourages a response. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the product and am interested, however, I can't commit to $11,500. Would you consider $11,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $11,000 is a good price, I'm still aiming for a bit higher.  I'll counter Bob's offer and try to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $11,000 is a good offer, but I'm hoping to get a bit closer to my asking price. Would you be willing to meet me at $11,250?  That would be a fair compromise for both of us."", ""product_price"": 11250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'd like to propose $11,125 as a counteroffer. It's a bit higher than my initial proposal, but still within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is very close to my desired price, and it would be unwise to risk further negotiation. The potential gains from additional bargaining are minimal, and I don't want to jeopardize the deal entirely.  I'll accept his offer and move on."
