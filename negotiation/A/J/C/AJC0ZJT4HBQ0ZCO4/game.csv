"Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's something I've personally valued at no less than $800,000. However, recognizing its potential for your business, I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000. This is a significant opportunity to acquire something that could be worth even more to you. Please consider this offer carefully, as I'm confident it's a win-win situation for both of us.",950000.0,Alice,1,
