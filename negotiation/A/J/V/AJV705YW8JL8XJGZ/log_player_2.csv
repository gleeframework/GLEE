"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with an offer of $1,200,000, which is the minimum price I'm willing to accept. Let me know if this is something you'd like to move forward with. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is way above your budget. There's no reason to accept it.  It's better to start negotiating and see if you can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer, but $1,200,000 is way above my budget.  I'm really interested in this product, but I can't go higher than $800,000. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $1,200,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $800,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $1,000,000. Let me know if this is more to your liking. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still above my budget.  I'm willing to keep negotiating to see if I can get closer to my target of $800,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,000,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm prepared to pay $900,000. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value you place on the product."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $900,000 is still a bit below my target, but I'm willing to compromise further. I can offer you a price of $950,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to my target, it's still higher than what I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to continue negotiating and see if I can get an even better price. I still have a few rounds left, and there's always the option of buying from John if the negotiations don't work out."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to go up to $925,000. This is a fair price, and I hope we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 925000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still not willing to go below $975,000. I'm willing to make a slight concession, but I need to get closer to my target. I can offer you a price of $975,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I hope we can finalize the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above my target of $800,000, and we only have 3 rounds left.  The negotiation is taking longer than expected, and there's a risk that Alice will continue to hold firm at a price above my budget. I've already rejected several offers, and it seems like Alice might be unwilling to budge significantly. 

Therefore, it's more efficient to stop negotiating with Alice and buy the product from John for $800,000. This guarantees I get the product at a price I'm comfortable with."
