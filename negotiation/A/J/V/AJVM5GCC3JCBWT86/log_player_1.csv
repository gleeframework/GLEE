I'm starting with a price of $10,000. This is a good starting point as it's significantly higher than my minimum but still leaves room for negotiation. It's important to be bold and start high to maximize my potential earnings."

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's tempting to take $8,500, I believe I can get a better deal.  I'm confident I can get closer to my ideal price by continuing the negotiation."

I'm offering $9,500. This is a slight decrease from my initial offer, but still significantly higher than Bob's offer. I'm hoping this will be a good compromise that Bob will accept."

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  While I would prefer a higher price, $9,250 is a good compromise and is significantly closer to my ideal price than selling to John.  It's time to close the deal!"
