Alice's offer:

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting close to my minimum price, Bob. I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. How about we meet at $115? It's still a bit higher than what you initially offered, but I think it's a fair compromise.

Alice is unlikely to go lower than $115, and at this point, it's more beneficial to take the guaranteed deal from John at $100."
