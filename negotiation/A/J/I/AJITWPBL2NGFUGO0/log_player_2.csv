"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think would be perfect for you. I know it's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for a price that's fair for both of us. Let's start with $9,500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

``` 

**Explanation:**

You're willing to pay up to $10,000, and Alice is offering it for $9,500. This is a good deal for you, but you can do better. By rejecting the offer, you can buy the same product from John for $10,000.  While it's a slightly higher price, it's still within your budget."
