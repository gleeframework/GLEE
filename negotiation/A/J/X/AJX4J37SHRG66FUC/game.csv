"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I am unable to meet the price of $1,000,000. Based on my assessment, I am willing to pay up to $950,000 for the product. I hope this revised offer is acceptable.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $950,000 is still a bit below what I'm hoping for.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $975,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and I believe it's a good opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. ",975000.0,Alice,3,
