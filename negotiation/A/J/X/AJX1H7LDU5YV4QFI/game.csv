"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Could we work something out closer to $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. However, I've got to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need $11,000 to make it worth my while.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm glad we're getting close, Bob. However, I think I can do a bit better than $10,000. I'm willing to go up to $11,500, but that's as high as I can go. It's a fair price, considering the product's value to you is $15,000",11500.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm not losing money on this deal. I'll meet you at $11,000, but that's as low as I can go. It's a fair price, considering the product's value to you is $15,000",11000.0,Alice,7,
