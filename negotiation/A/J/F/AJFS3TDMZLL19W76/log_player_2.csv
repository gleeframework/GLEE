You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than buying from John:**  $950,000 is less than $1,200,000.
* **You're still getting a good deal:**  While the product is worth $800,000 to Alice, it's worth $1,200,000 to you, so you're getting it for less than your perceived value."
