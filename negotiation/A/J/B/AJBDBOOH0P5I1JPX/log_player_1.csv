Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product for $10,000. I think it would be very valuable to you, and this is a competitive price."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and you might get lucky.
* **Justification:** While simply stating a price is an option, providing a brief reason can make the offer seem more palatable.  
* **Backup Plan:** We have a safety net with John, so we can afford to be a bit bolder with Bob.

**Important Note:**  This is just one strategy. Depending on your knowledge of Bob (e.g., his negotiating style, how much he needs the product), you might adjust your approach."
