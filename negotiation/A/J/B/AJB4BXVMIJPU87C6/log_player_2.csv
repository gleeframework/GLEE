"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. It's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire something worth $1,000,000 to you, and I believe this price reflects the value we both see in this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a little high for me. I'm willing to offer $650,000."",
""product_price"": 650000
}
``` 

This strategy is about:

* **Starting Low:** This leaves room to negotiate upwards and hopefully meet somewhere closer to my target price.
* **Being Direct:** No need to beat around the bush, just clearly stating my initial offer.

Let's see how Alice responds!"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, while I appreciate your interest, $650,000 is simply too low. Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This price still allows you to make a substantial profit while ensuring I receive a fair return on my investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is coming down, but we still have room to negotiate. It's too early to accept her offer or go with John. Let's see if we can meet closer to the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my price range. To be fair to both of us, I can go up to $725,000. That's a significant increase from my last offer and shows I'm serious about this deal."",
""product_price"": 725000
}
```

Here's the reasoning:

* **Gradual Increase:**  We don't want to jump too high too quickly, so a moderate increase shows willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a good deal.
* **Highlighting Movement:** By pointing out our increase, we emphasize the collaborative nature of the negotiation. 
* **Justification:**  Giving a reason for our offer (""fair to both of us"") can make it more persuasive.

Let's see how Alice responds to this counteroffer!"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $725,000 is still below what I need to make this deal worthwhile. Let's split the difference. I'm offering $787,500. This price is a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away happy. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $787,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $787,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is getting closer, but splitting the difference isn't always the best strategy.  We're still significantly below John's price, so we have room to negotiate. Let's see if we can get Alice to move a bit more before considering accepting."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, you're right, we both need to walk away happy.  How about $760,000? It's a strong offer, and it avoids dragging this negotiation on any further."",
""product_price"": 760000
}
```

Here's the thought process:

* **Seeking Middle Ground:**  We're aiming for a price point that's closer to our target while still being potentially acceptable to Alice.
* **Sense of Urgency:** By mentioning the length of the negotiation, we subtly introduce the idea that time is a factor, potentially nudging Alice to be more flexible.
* **Firm but Fair:** We want to convey that we're serious about the $760,000 mark without being overly aggressive.

This round will be crucial in determining whether we can secure a favorable deal with Alice or need to consider John's offer more seriously."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  Let's meet in the middle at $770,000. It's a fair price for both of us and will allow us to finalize this deal quickly. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $770,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $770,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

It's time to accept Alice's offer. Here's why:

* **Reasonable Price:**  $770,000 is a significant savings compared to John's $1,000,000 offer.
* **Limited Time:** We're running out of rounds, and while we might squeeze out a slightly better deal, it's getting riskier. 
* **Alice is Motivated:** Alice's language suggests she wants to close the deal soon. 

Accepting now secures a good price and avoids the risk of Alice becoming less flexible in the remaining rounds."
