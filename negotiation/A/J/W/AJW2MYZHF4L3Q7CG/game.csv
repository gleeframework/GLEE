"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this valuable product from me. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting our conversation, I'm willing to make a fair and competitive offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1,400,000.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product,  $1,400,000 is unfortunately above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000, which is still a significant amount and reflects the value I see in the product. Let's see if we can work something out.",1250000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still confident that the product's value justifies a higher price. Considering your offer, I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a price of $1,350,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's true worth. What do you think?",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price, but $1,350,000 is still a bit higher than what I can comfortably pay.  I'm willing to offer $1,300,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my budget, and I believe it's a mutually beneficial agreement.  Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us.",1300000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make another concession. However, I still believe the product's value is higher than your latest offer. Considering your budget, I'm willing to drop the price to $1,325,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's worth. What do you think?",1325000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. However, $1,325,000 is still beyond my budget. I'm prepared to offer $1,275,000, which reflects the value I see in the product while staying within my financial limitations.  This is a fair price that we can both agree on, and I'm confident it's a good deal for both of us.  Let's make this happen.",1275000.0,Bob,6,

"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go below $1,300,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between your latest offer and my previous one. I propose a price of $1,312,500. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value.
