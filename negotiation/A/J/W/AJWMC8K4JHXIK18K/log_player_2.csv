"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product I think you might be interested in. It's worth $80 to you, right? I'm offering it to you for $100.  That's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer ($100) is higher than your maximum budget ($80) and higher than John's offer ($80). 
* By rejecting Alice's offer, you can buy the product from John at a lower price, saving you $20."
