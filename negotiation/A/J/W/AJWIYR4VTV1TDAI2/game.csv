"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's worth more to you and allows me to make a good profit. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $6,000 for the product. It's a fair price considering its value to me.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $6,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000, which is still a great deal for you considering the value of the product. Let's meet in the middle.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you're looking for a fair price. How about we split the difference and settle at $7,500? That feels like a reasonable compromise to me.",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming up to $7,500.  How about we meet in the middle again at $8,500?  That's a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close the deal.",8500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting closer.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $8,000. That's a very strong offer considering my budget, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price.",8000.0,Bob,6,
