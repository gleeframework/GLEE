Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1150000} 
```

This offer is a starting point. It's above Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation. It also allows me to gauge his interest and see if he's willing to come closer to my minimum desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Bob's offer is too low. While it's tempting to accept, I'm confident I can get a better price. I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

I'm lowering my price a bit to show flexibility, but still maintaining a significant margin above Bob's initial offer. This counteroffer signals a willingness to negotiate while also testing Bob's commitment to a deal."
