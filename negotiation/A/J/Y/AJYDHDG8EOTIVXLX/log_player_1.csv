{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this unique product at a price that reflects its exceptional value.  My starting offer is $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's worth to you.  Let's discuss and see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1400000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. However,  $1,400,000 is a bit high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I have a budget in mind. Would you consider $1,000,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,000,000 is a significant amount, it's below my minimum acceptable price. I'll see if I can negotiate a better price with Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. While I can't come down to $1,000,000, I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet in the middle at $1,200,000? This price still allows me to profit while offering you a great deal on this valuable product."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
