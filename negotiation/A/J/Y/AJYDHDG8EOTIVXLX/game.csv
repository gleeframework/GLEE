"Alice, thanks for the offer. However,  $1,400,000 is a bit high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I have a budget in mind. Would you consider $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. While I can't come down to $1,000,000, I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet in the middle at $1,200,000? This price still allows me to profit while offering you a great deal on this valuable product.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
