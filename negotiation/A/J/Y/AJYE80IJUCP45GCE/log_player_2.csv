# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for $95. It's a great opportunity to get it at a discount compared to its value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

While $95 is a decent price and a good discount, there's still room for negotiation to try and get the product even cheaper."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. That's a good price, but I'm on a bit of a budget right now. Would you consider $80?"",
""product_price"": 80
}
```

This counteroffer aims to significantly lower the price while still being reasonable and acknowledging Alice's initial discount. It opens the floor for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest in our product, Bob. Considering your budget constraints, I'm willing to negotiate further. How about $85? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is clearly willing to negotiate, and we're getting closer to a price that represents significant savings. It's worth one more try to see if we can get even closer to $80."
