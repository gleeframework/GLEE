"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it's worth every penny. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's a good idea to start by rejecting Alice's offer. The product is worth $10,000 to you, and Alice is asking for $12,000. You can try to negotiate a lower price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer but I'm not quite ready to let it go for $9,000.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,500?  It's a great price for a great product! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500

You're very close to your target price of $10,000.  It's worth trying to negotiate a little lower before accepting."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you're firm on the price, but $10,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm happy to pay $10,200 and consider this a final offer.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10200}
