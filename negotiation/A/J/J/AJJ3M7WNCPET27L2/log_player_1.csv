Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase [product name] for $1,199,999. This is a limited-time offer, as I have another interested buyer. Given its value and potential, I believe this is a fantastic deal."",
""product_price"": 1199999
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed sale at $1,200,000 from John, it's always advantageous to explore if you can get a higher price. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** Setting the price at $1,199,999 does a few things:
    * It's just below your guaranteed sale price, maximizing potential profit.
    * It creates a sense of urgency (""limited-time offer"") to encourage Bob to act quickly.
    * The price uses the psychological tactic of ending in ""999"" which often feels like a ""deal"" compared to a rounded number. 
* **Alternative Buyer Leverage:**  Mentioning ""another interested buyer"" subtly leverages your guaranteed sale without revealing the exact amount John is willing to pay.

**Important Note:** This assumes you are comfortable with the potential risk of Bob rejecting the offer, in which case you'll sell to John at the lower price."
