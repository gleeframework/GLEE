# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you an incredible opportunity to own this exceptional product. I believe you'll love it, and I'm confident it will bring you a lot of value. I'm willing to sell it to you for $20000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","I'd like to reject Alice's offer. The product is too expensive for me at $20,000. I can get it from John for $12,000, which is a much better deal.
