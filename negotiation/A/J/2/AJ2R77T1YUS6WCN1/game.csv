"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,800,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price, considering the product's value and my budget. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget of $1,000,000.",1800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the value.  To be frank, $1,800,000 is quite a bit lower than I'd be comfortable with.  How about we meet in the middle at $2,000,000? This offer reflects the true value of the product while acknowledging your interest.",2000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $2,000,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,600,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price, considering the product's value and my financial constraints.",1600000.0,Bob,4,
