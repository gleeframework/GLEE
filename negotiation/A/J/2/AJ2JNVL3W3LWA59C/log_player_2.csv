# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a unique opportunity to acquire something truly valuable. I'm starting with a price of $1200000. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer but I'm looking to pay a bit less for this product. I'm willing to pay $900,000. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still looking for a price closer to my initial asking price.  I'm willing to come down to $1000000. This reflects the product's value and gives you a good deal. Let's see if we can agree on this. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
You're still aiming for the lowest possible price.  While $1,000,000 is better than $1,200,000, you can potentially get it for less.  Rejecting the offer allows you to continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm still interested but $1,000,000 is still a bit high for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $950,000? This would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but I'm still hoping to get a price closer to my initial asking price. I'm willing to come down to $975000. This would be a fair compromise and we can both walk away satisfied. Let's find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While you're aiming for the lowest price, Alice is now offering a price that is closer to your target, and you're at the halfway point of the negotiation. Accepting this offer allows you to secure the product for a good price while also avoiding the risk of not reaching an agreement with Alice and having to buy from John at a higher cost."
