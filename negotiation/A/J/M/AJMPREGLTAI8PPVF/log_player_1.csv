{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,000,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly less than its true value to you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's a significant discount from Bob's perceived value:**  $1,000,000 is $200,000 less than what the product is worth to Bob, making it attractive.
* **It's above your minimum acceptable price:** You're still making a substantial profit, as it's $200,000 more than your minimum.

This leaves room for negotiation but sets a strong starting point. You can adjust this offer based on Bob's response and the potential of a counter-offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but that price is a little high for me. Would you consider $700,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $700,000 is a decent offer, it's below my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. I'm going to reject this offer and counter with a price closer to my desired value.  There's still potential to negotiate with Bob, and I'm not willing to settle for a price that significantly undervalues the product."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $700,000 is too far below my minimum acceptable price. How about we meet in the middle at $850,000? This still offers you a significant discount from the product's value to you, while ensuring a fair deal for me.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $775,000

While $775,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not satisfied with that price. I want to try and get closer to my desired price of $850,000.  There's still room for negotiation, and I don't want to settle for a price that is too low. I'm going to reject this offer and counter with a price slightly lower than my previous offer."
