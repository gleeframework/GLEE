Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $700,000 is too far below my minimum acceptable price. How about we meet in the middle at $850,000? This still offers you a significant discount from the product's value to you, while ensuring a fair deal for me.  Let's see if we can find common ground.
