"Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,000,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly less than its true value to you. Let me know your thoughts.",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but that price is a little high for me. Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $700,000 is too far below my minimum acceptable price. How about we meet in the middle at $850,000? This still offers you a significant discount from the product's value to you, while ensuring a fair deal for me.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $850,000 is closer, but I need to be a bit more aggressive to make this work.  Would you be willing to do $775,000?",775000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your need to be price-conscious. Let's see if we can bridge the gap.  How about $825,000?  This is a compromise that still allows for a good profit for me and a significant discount for you.  I'm willing to work with you to make this happen.",825000.0,Alice,5,
