"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer! I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $120? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $120 is better than $100, I think I can do better by continuing to negotiate with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking for a bit closer to my asking price. How about we split the difference and settle on $135? Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 135}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $135 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $125? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 
I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  $125 is a good price, and I'm getting closer to my desired price point. There's a chance I could get a bit more, but the risk of losing the deal altogether isn't worth it at this point."
