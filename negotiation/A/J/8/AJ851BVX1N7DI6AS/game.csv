"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product and appreciate your investment. However, I believe we can reach a fair agreement. How about $950,000 for the product?",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $950,000 is unfortunately too low for me. While I understand your perspective, I've invested significantly in this product and need to recoup those costs.  How about we split the difference and go with $1,075,000? This price still provides you with a substantial value gain and ensures a fair outcome for both of us. ",1075000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I've given this careful consideration and I appreciate your position. However, I would like to propose an alternative at $1,050,000. This still allows for a reasonable profit for you while keeping the cost within my budget.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
