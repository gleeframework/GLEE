Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting with a price of $150. This is a reasonable starting point, as it's higher than my minimum acceptable price of $100, but it also leaves room for negotiation. 

I'm curious to see if Bob is willing to pay this price, or if he'll make a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$80 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $100. While I could sell to Bob at that price, it's not a good deal for me. I'm going to reject his offer and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $120. This is still lower than my initial offer, but it's a significant increase from Bob's offer. I'm hoping that this price will be more appealing to Bob and we can reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While $90 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still not satisfied with the deal.  I don't want to continue negotiating back and forth.  John is offering a guaranteed $100, which is a much better option than risking a continued negotiation with Bob.  I'm going to sell to John."
