Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,450,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 1450000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's value:** He's willing to pay $1,200,000, so $1,450,000 gives him some room to negotiate.
* **It's below my minimum:** I'm willing to sell for at least $1,500,000, so I'm still leaving myself room for negotiation.
* **It shows flexibility:** I'm open to negotiation, which increases the chances of a successful deal. 

If Bob rejects, I'll assess his counteroffer and either accept it or make a counter-counteroffer.  I'll also keep in mind the option of selling to John for $1,500,000 if I don't feel I can get a better deal with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but I'm aiming for a price closer to $1,200,000. I'm confident this product is worth that much to me, and I'm hoping we can find a compromise.  Would you be open to $1,300,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,300,000 is closer to my minimum price, it's still significantly lower than what I'd like to get.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer. I want to see if we can find a middle ground."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,300,000 is closer, it's still a bit lower than what I'm aiming for.  I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1400000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. I'm still aiming for a bit lower, though. Would you be willing to go to $1,350,000? That's a good middle ground for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer of $1,350,000 is tempting, it's still below my minimum goal.  I'm going to reject this offer and counter with one last attempt to reach a compromise. I'll keep in mind that selling to John for $1,500,000 is always an option if this negotiation falls through."
