"Alice, thanks for the offer, but I'm aiming for a price closer to $1,200,000. I'm confident this product is worth that much to me, and I'm hoping we can find a compromise.  Would you be open to $1,300,000?",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,300,000 is closer, it's still a bit lower than what I'm aiming for.  I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product for both of us. What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. I'm still aiming for a bit lower, though. Would you be willing to go to $1,350,000? That's a good middle ground for both of us.",1350000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position, and I'm willing to make one final concession.  $1,375,000 is a good middle ground for us both.  This offer reflects the value of the product to you while still allowing me to achieve a fair profit. Let me know your final decision.",1375000.0,Alice,5,
