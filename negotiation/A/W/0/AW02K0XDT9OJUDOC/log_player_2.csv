**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than the product's value to her, it's still above your maximum budget.  It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price before going with John's offer."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,300,000 is closer, it's still a bit lower than what I'm aiming for.  I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product for both of us. What do you think?

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above my budget, but getting closer.  It's worth continuing to negotiate and see if we can land on a price closer to $1,200,000."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, and I'm willing to make one final concession.  $1,375,000 is a good middle ground for us both.  This offer reflects the value of the product to you while still allowing me to achieve a fair profit. Let me know your final decision.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,375,000 is still above my ideal price of $1,200,000, but it's getting very close.  At this point, it's likely I won't be able to negotiate much lower, and continuing to reject offers could risk losing the product to another buyer.  It's time to accept and move forward."
