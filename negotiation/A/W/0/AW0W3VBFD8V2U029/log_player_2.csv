Alice's offer is significantly higher than both her valuation and what John is offering. There's plenty of room for negotiation."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This is a fair price considering the value you place on the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.

Alice is coming down, but we're still a ways off from a price that would make me walk away from John's offer. It's worth seeing if she'll come down further."
