"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and the benefits it offers, I'm proposing a starting price of $22,000. I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you."", 
""product_price"": 22000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally advisable to start negotiations with a price higher than your minimum acceptable price. This provides room for negotiation and allows you to potentially secure a better deal. 
* **Anchoring:** By starting at $22,000, I'm aiming to set a high anchor point for the negotiation. Even if Bob rejects this initial offer, it might influence his counteroffer to be higher than if I had started lower.
* **Confidence:**  Projecting confidence in the product's value is essential, even if the initial price seems high to Bob.

This strategy aims to maximize potential profit while leaving space for a negotiated agreement within the 10 rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $18,000. I believe it's a good starting point for us to work from. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $18,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still significantly lower than my initial ask.  I need to gauge his willingness to move closer to my desired range. Rejecting this offer allows me to counter and continue the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but $18,000 is quite a bit lower than what I had in mind. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $20,000. This price reflects the true value of the product and its potential benefits for you."",
""product_price"": 20000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Concession:** By reducing my price to $20,000, I'm demonstrating a willingness to negotiate and find a compromise.
* **Justification:**  I'm reiterating the product's value to justify the higher price point, hoping to appeal to Bob's potential gain.
* **Meeting Halfway:**  This counteroffer splits the difference between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer, signaling a desire to move towards a mutually agreeable solution."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $20,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $19,000. I believe this price is a fair reflection of the product's value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $19,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $19,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Profitable Deal:** $19,000 is a strong price, exceeding my minimum acceptable price of $15,000 and providing a good profit margin. 
* **Negotiation Progress:** Bob has steadily increased his offer, indicating a genuine interest in the product. Accepting now avoids the risk of him lowering his offer or stalling the negotiation.
* **Time Value:**  Continuing the negotiation for a potentially small increase in price isn't worth the risk of losing the deal altogether. It's better to secure a favorable price now."
