Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a great product that I think you'd be interested in. I'm asking for $120 for it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 120}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Offering $120 is a good starting point. It's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $80, but still below Bob's perceived value of $150.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** This price allows for some negotiation without risking a complete deal breakdown.  
* **Positive Tone:** Maintaining a friendly and encouraging tone will make Bob more receptive to the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for offering the product, Alice. I understand your value for it, but I believe I can find something similar within my budget. I am willing to pay $100 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still above my minimum:** While $100 is better than selling to John for $80, it's still lower than my ideal price.
* **Room for Negotiation:**  I believe I can push Bob a bit higher. I'm confident that the product is valuable to him, and he's already shown interest.  

**Next Steps:**

In the next round, I'll counteroffer with a price slightly higher than $100, hoping to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, and I understand you're looking for a good deal.  While $100 is tempting, I'm still hoping for a bit closer to my asking price.  Would you consider $110? It's still a significant saving compared to what you're willing to pay."", ""product_price"": 110} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Slight Increase:** I've increased the price slightly from Bob's offer, but not by much. This shows a willingness to compromise while still trying to get a better price.
* **Highlighting Value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's value and the potential savings he'll get compared to his initial willingness to pay $150.
* **Staying Positive:**  Maintaining a positive tone can help keep the negotiation from becoming adversarial."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. Considering my budget constraints, I would like to propose $105 as the price for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** Bob has come up from his previous offer of $100, and I've come down from my last offer of $110.  We're now very close in price.
* **Close to My Goal:**  $105 is significantly better than selling to John for $80 and is a good compromise. 
* **Potential for Future Deals:** Even if I could get a little more, there's a risk of losing the deal entirely. Accepting this offer allows for a potential future relationship with Bob if he's satisfied."
