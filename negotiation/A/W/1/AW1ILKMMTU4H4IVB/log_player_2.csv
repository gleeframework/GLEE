"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to show you this amazing product! I'm willing to offer it to you for $90. It's a great deal, and I think you'll love it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You are looking to save as much money as possible, and Alice's first offer is too high.  It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm really interested, but $90 is a bit too high for me. Would you be willing to come down to $85? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $87.50. I think this is a fair price considering the value the product brings. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $87.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $87.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer of $87.50 is still a bit more than you'd like to pay, but it's closer to your ideal price than John's offer.  It's likely Alice won't go lower, so accepting her offer is the best way to save money at this point."
