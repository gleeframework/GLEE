"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $200 represents its true value, I'm willing to come down to $170. This is my best offer.",170.0,Alice,3,

"Alice,  I really appreciate you coming down in price. Unfortunately, $170 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. How about $130? That's a good price for both of us, I think.",130.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm trying to be flexible, but I can't go as low as $130.  Let's meet in the middle, how about $150? This is my final offer.",150.0,Alice,5,
