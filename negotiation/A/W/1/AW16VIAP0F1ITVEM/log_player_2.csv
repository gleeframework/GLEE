"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this valuable product for a great price of $200. It's a fantastic deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
This product is worth $150 to Alice, and she's offering it for $200. That's way too high for you. You'll need to counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $200 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $120 for the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $200 represents its true value, I'm willing to come down to $170. This is my best offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $170. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $170
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is still too high.  You can get the product for $100 from John. It's worth trying to negotiate a better deal with Alice, but you're not going to accept anything over $100."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I really appreciate you coming down in price. Unfortunately, $170 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. How about $130? That's a good price for both of us, I think."", ""product_price"": 130}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm trying to be flexible, but I can't go as low as $130.  Let's meet in the middle, how about $150? This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's offer of $150 is still above your maximum price point.  You have the opportunity to get the product from John for $100, so it's time to take that option and end the negotiation with Alice."
