"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested in the product, but $12000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. Would you be willing to go down to $10500?  I think that's a fair price considering the value we both see in this deal.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not comfortable going down to $10500. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $11500. This is a fair price considering the value I believe the product holds. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $11500 is still a bit outside my budget.  How about we split the difference and settle on $11000?  That's a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to finalize this deal.",11000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your desire to split the difference, but I'm not willing to go down to $11000. However, I'm willing to make a slightly more aggressive counteroffer.
