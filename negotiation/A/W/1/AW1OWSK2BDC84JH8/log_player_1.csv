{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd be really interested in. I'm asking for $15,000 for it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($10,000) to leave room for negotiation.
* **Enthusiasm:** I'm expressing excitement about the product to pique Bob's interest.
* **Open-ended:** I'm leaving it open for Bob to respond with his thoughts, allowing for a conversation and potential counteroffer. 

**Note:** This is a starting point. My strategy will adapt depending on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I'm interested, $15000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go. Would you be open to $12000?  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:** While I'm willing to negotiate, $12,000 is still lower than my floor price of $10,000.  
* **Potential for better deal:** I believe I can get closer to my desired price by making a counteroffer and continuing the negotiation. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While selling to John for $10,000 is a guaranteed outcome, I'm willing to take a chance on a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I appreciate your interest. While $12,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to come down to $13,000 to make this deal work. It's a fair price considering the value of this product. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing willingness to compromise by meeting Bob halfway between our initial offers.
* **Highlight Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to justify my price.
* **Urgency:** I'm subtly implying that this might be my final offer, encouraging Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for being flexible.  $13000 is still a bit high for me. I'm confident I can get this product for $11000 elsewhere, so I'm really hoping we can bridge the gap. How about we split the difference and settle on $12000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:**  $12,000 is still lower than my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.
* **Risk of further negotiation:** Continuing to negotiate with Bob could lead to a further decrease in price, potentially resulting in a deal that's not profitable for me.
* **Guaranteed outcome:** Selling to John for $10,000 provides a certain and acceptable outcome, ensuring I don't lose money on this deal.

While I'm motivated to get the best possible price, the risk of further negotiation and the potential for a lower offer doesn't outweigh the certainty of selling to John."
