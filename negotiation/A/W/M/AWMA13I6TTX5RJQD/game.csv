Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the purchase of my product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer you the product for $900000. This is a competitive price considering its worth to you is $800000. I believe this is a fair starting point for our negotiation. What do you think?,900000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $750000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's worth to me is $800000.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go as low as $750000. Considering the product's worth to me is $1200000, I'm willing to compromise and offer it to you for $850000. This is still a significant discount from its true value, and I believe it's a fair price considering the benefits you'll gain from owning the product. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $775000. I think that's a fair price considering the product's worth to me is $800000.",775000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $775000. Considering the product's worth to me is $1200000, I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'll offer it to you for $825000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the benefits you'll gain from owning the product. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,5,
