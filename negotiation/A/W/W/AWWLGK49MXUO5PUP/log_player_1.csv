{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm asking for $150 for it, what do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

This offer starts with a moderately high price, leaving room for negotiation while still exceeding your minimum acceptable value. It also includes a friendly opening message to build rapport and encourage engagement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $120 is above your minimum acceptable value, it's still lower than your initial offer.  Rejecting allows you to counter with a price closer to your desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for your interest, Bob! I appreciate the offer, but $120 is a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $135?  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 135}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $125. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $127.50? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $127.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $127.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

At this point, Bob has come up to $127.5, which is close enough to your initial counteroffer of $135.  Accepting his offer ensures a sale above your minimum acceptable value and avoids further back-and-forth negotiation."
