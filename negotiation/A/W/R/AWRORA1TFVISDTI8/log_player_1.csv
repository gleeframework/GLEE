``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price slightly above Bob's perceived value, leaving room for negotiation. It also emphasizes the value of the product for Bob, making him more likely to consider the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $13,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $10,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $10,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum price of $12,000.  I'm not willing to sell for that low.  I'll counter Bob's offer and see if we can reach a more agreeable price."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price, but I can't go lower than $11,500. This is still a good deal for you considering the value of the product. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 11500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand you can't go as low as $10,000.  How about we split the difference and settle at $10,750? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $10,750 is closer to my minimum price, I'm still not comfortable selling it for less than $12,000. I'll make one last counteroffer and if Bob doesn't budge, I'll just sell to John."
