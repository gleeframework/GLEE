Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,000,000 from John, so you won't accept less from Bob.
* **Bob's Valuation:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob, meaning he has a potential profit of $200,000 if he buys at your minimum.
* **Information Asymmetry:** Bob doesn't know about your deal with John, and you don't know how high Bob is willing to go.

**Strategy**

You want to maximize your profit while ensuring Bob accepts the deal. A price too close to $1,200,000 leaves little room for Bob to see value, risking rejection.  

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exclusive opportunity to acquire the product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm confident it will significantly benefit you. I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Confident Language:**  Phrases like ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""unique value proposition"" enhance the perceived value.
* **Strategic Pricing:**  $1,150,000 allows you to capture a significant portion of the potential profit while still leaving Bob with a $50,000 incentive to buy.

**Important Considerations**

* **Bob's Negotiation Style:** If you anticipate Bob is a tough negotiator, you might start slightly higher to leave room for concessions.
* **Relationship Value:** If maintaining a strong relationship with Bob is paramount, a slightly lower price might be strategic in the long run."
