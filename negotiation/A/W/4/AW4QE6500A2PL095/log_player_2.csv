"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice further. You can likely get a better price than $11,500."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
``` 

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $10,500. This is a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer, but still leaves some room for negotiation. It's a reasonable starting point that shows I'm serious about buying the product, but I'm also determined to get a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm still going to reject Alice's offer. I'm confident that I can get a better price, especially since we've already been through a round of negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10750}
``` 

I'm going to increase my counteroffer to $10,750. This is a smaller jump than before, but still shows Alice that I'm willing to move slightly while trying to stay within my budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice's offer of $10,900 is getting closer to my target price.  At this point, I'm going to accept. It's likely that we'll continue to haggle, but it's better to get the product now and potentially have a better chance of getting a better price later, than to risk losing the opportunity."
