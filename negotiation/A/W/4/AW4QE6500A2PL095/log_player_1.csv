"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $11,500. This is a good starting point because it's above my minimum price of $10,000 but leaves room for negotiation. It also reflects the fact that the product is worth more to Bob.  I'm hoping to get closer to his $12,000 valuation over the next few rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is above my minimum price of $10,000, it's still significantly lower than my desired price. I'm going to reject this offer and try to get a better price in the next round. I believe I can still negotiate a better deal with Bob, and I'm not willing to settle for such a low price just yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm going to counter with a price of $11,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but it's still a good price for me, and it shows Bob I'm willing to negotiate. It also leaves room for further negotiation in the next round if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is higher than the previous round, it's still quite a bit lower than what I'm hoping to get. I'm going to reject this offer and try to push for a higher price.  I'm not yet at a point where I'm willing to settle for such a low price, especially since I still have some rounds left to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10900}
```

I'm going to counter with $10,900.  This shows Bob that I'm willing to meet him halfway, while still being closer to my desired price.  I believe this is a reasonable compromise and a good way to keep the negotiations moving forward."
