"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling this product to you. I believe it could be incredibly valuable for you, potentially worth even more than its value to me. To start the conversation, I propose a price of $950,000. What are your thoughts?",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the value I can get out of it. What do you think?",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. However, $750,000 is significantly below its true value and what I'm willing to accept.  I could consider a price of $900,000. It reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your initial offer.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $900,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $850,000. I think that's a fair price considering the value I'll get out of the product. What do you think?",850000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting closer. I acknowledge your position and am willing to be flexible to close this deal. How about we settle at $875,000? This represents a significant compromise on my end while still reflecting the product's inherent value.",875000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $875,000 is still a bit above my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $825,000. I think that's a fair price considering the value I'll get out of the product. What do you think?",825000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm sensing some resistance on your end. While I'm still open to reaching a deal with you, I need to be upfront about my bottom line. I can go as low as $860,000, but that's my absolute final offer. This is a significant discount from my initial asking price, and I believe it's more than fair. ",860000.0,Alice,7,

"I understand your position, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to be flexible. However, $860,000 is still a bit above my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $830,000.
