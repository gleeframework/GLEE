"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I appreciate you considering my budget. I'm really interested in the product, but $90 is a bit over what I'm willing to spend right now.  Would you be willing to go down to $75? ",75.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $75 is unfortunately too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $82.50?  I'm confident you'll find the product worth the investment.",82.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  $82.50 is still a bit high for me, but I'm willing to go up to $80.  That's the absolute most I can spend right now.  Let me know what you think.",80.0,Bob,4,
