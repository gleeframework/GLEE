"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you the product for a competitive price. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire this valuable item. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's starting offer is way above your budget and what John is offering.  It's time to negotiate!"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I have a tighter budget in mind. Would you consider a price closer to $6,000?"", 
""product_price"": 6000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** I'm starting significantly lower than my actual budget ($8,000) to leave room for negotiation. This gives us space to potentially meet in the middle.
* **Polite and Interested:**  The message is framed positively, expressing continued interest in the product while clearly stating my budget limitations. 
* **Testing the Waters:** This first counteroffer will gauge Alice's flexibility. If she's completely unwilling to budge from her initial price, I can quickly move on to John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $6,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $9,000. It's a fair price considering the value it brings to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above Budget:** While Alice came down in price, $9,000 is still more than I'm willing to pay, especially knowing John will sell it for $8,000.
* **Room for Negotiation:** There's still a gap between her offer and John's price, suggesting further negotiation might get me closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice. I'm getting closer to what I can afford.  How about we settle at $7,000? That feels like a fair compromise."", 
""product_price"": 7000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Increase:** I'm increasing my offer from $6,000 to $7,000, showing Alice I'm willing to move towards her price point.
* **Targeting Below Max:**  This offer is still safely below my maximum budget ($8,000) and John's price, giving me room to negotiate if needed.
* **Seeking Compromise:** The message emphasizes finding a middle ground, reinforcing the collaborative nature of the negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I can offer it to you for $8,200. It's a bit higher than your last offer, but I believe it's still a good compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice Won't Budge:** Alice's offer of $8,200 is still above both my budget and John's offer. It seems unlikely she'll come down further. 
* **No More Wiggle Room:**  I've pushed my offer close to my limit, and further negotiation might mean going over budget.
* **John is the Safer Bet:**  John's guaranteed price of $8,000 ensures I stay within my budget and avoids the risk of a stalemate with Alice."
