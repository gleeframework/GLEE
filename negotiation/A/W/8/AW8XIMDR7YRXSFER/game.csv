"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product's potential, $20000 is above my budget. I'm interested in purchasing, but I can only offer $10000 at this time.  Let me know if this is a workable price for you.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your budget constraints. I would like to propose a compromise at $15000 for the product. This is still above the $10000 you've offered, but it's closer to the original asking price. I hope this aligns better with your financial situation and allows us to move forward with the transaction.",15000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $15000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $12000.  This represents a significant compromise from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product.",12000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your continued interest, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer. I am pleased to counter with $13500 for the product. This is a fair compromise between our previous offers, and I believe it reflects the value of the product while staying within your budget constraints.",13500.0,Alice,5,
