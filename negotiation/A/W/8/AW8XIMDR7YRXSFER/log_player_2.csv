Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

**Reasoning:**

Alice is still offering a price higher than my comfortable budget. With only 5 rounds remaining, it's not clear if we will reach a mutually agreeable price. To avoid the risk of going over budget, it's better to secure the product from John for $10,000."
