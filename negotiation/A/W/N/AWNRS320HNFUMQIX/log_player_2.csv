I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. What do you think?

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still looking to get a good value for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our initial offer and your counteroffer. How about we settle on $850,000? This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the effort I've put into it. What do you think?

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your desire to get a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. However, I'm willing to make one more compromise. I can offer it to you for $825,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000

Reasoning: 

Alice is clearly holding firm on a price above $800,000. While we could continue negotiating, it's unlikely she'll drop below $800,000. Accepting at $825,000 secures a significant savings compared to John's $1,200,000 price."
