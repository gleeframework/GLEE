"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $950,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $700,000?  I believe that's a fair offer considering its value.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me. However, $850,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go.  Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $775,000? That feels like a fair compromise.",775000.0,Bob,4,
