"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase my product for $11,500. I believe this product would be highly beneficial to you, and this offer represents a great value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $11,500 is less than John's price, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting Alice's offer allows Bob to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested, $11,500 is a bit higher than I'd like to go. I'd be willing to pay $10,500 for the product. This reflects its value to me and allows for a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and counter-offer.  While I'm motivated to sell, $10,500 is a bit too low for me to accept.  Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $11,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value:** Bob values the product at $12,000. Alice is now offering it for $11,000.
* **Potential Savings:**  This offer is $1,000 less than buying from John, representing a significant saving.
* **Risk:**  While further negotiation is possible, the risk is that Alice will reject future counteroffers, forcing Bob to buy from John at the higher price.

Therefore, accepting Alice's offer ensures Bob gets the product at a good price with minimal risk."
