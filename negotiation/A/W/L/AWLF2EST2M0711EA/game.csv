"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value is much higher. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $950,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $950,000 might be a stretch for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $800,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $900,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the effort I've put into it. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me a bit, Alice.  How about we settle at $850,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",850000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $850,000 is a good compromise, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. I'll sell the product to you for $875,000. This is my final offer, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",875000.0,Alice,5,
