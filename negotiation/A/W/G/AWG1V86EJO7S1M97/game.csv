"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the value of the product, I believe a price of $10,000 would be more reasonable. Would you be willing to consider this price?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your feedback and understand that you think the product is worth $10,000 to you. However, I have to consider my own minimum price for the product, which is higher than that. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $13,000. This is a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product.",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the counteroffer. I'm getting closer to a price point where I see this working. How about we settle at $11,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm glad you're getting closer to a price point that works for you. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $11,000. I'm willing to come down to $12,500, which is still a good deal for both of us. I think you'll really appreciate the value this product will bring to your business.",12500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting close, but I need to see a bit more movement to make this work. How about $11,500? I'm hoping we can find a middle ground and agree on a price today.",11500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to find a mutually beneficial price. However, I'm still not comfortable going as low as $11,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $12,500 and $11,500, which would be $12,000. I think this is a fair price that reflects the product's value and your needs.",12000.0,Alice,7,
