Round 3
Alice's offer:

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to find a mutually beneficial price. However, I'm still not comfortable going as low as $11,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $12,500 and $11,500, which would be $12,000. I think this is a fair price that reflects the product's value and your needs. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000

Alice has moved a bit from her initial offer and we're getting close to John's price. Accepting at $12,000 secures a decent saving."
