"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than that. What do you think?",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer. While I'm happy to negotiate, $9000 is still a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $9500?  I'm confident you'll still get a great deal on this product.",9500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand that you're trying to make a profit, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $9000. How about we meet in the middle again? I'm willing to go up to $9250. Can you consider that?",9250.0,Bob,4,
