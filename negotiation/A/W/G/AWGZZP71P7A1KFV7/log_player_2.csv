# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a great opportunity to get your hands on something really valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $90. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:

You should reject Alice's offer because it's still above your $100 limit. It's better to try and negotiate a lower price."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $85 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can do $87 for the product. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy it.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $87

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
You should accept Alice's offer.  While you would prefer to pay $85, $87 is still within your budget and a better deal than buying from John for $100."
