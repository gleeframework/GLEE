"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you have a budget to work with, but $900,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit.  How about $950,000? It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close this deal quickly.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $950,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $925,000?",925000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob,  I appreciate your flexibility. Let's split the difference.  How about $937,500? This feels like a fair price that works for both of us, and it keeps us moving towards a deal.  What do you say?",937500.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to go up to $925,000, but no higher. How about we meet at $925,000?",925000.0,Bob,6,
