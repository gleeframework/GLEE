"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,500. I'm really interested in the product, but I have to make sure it fits within my budget.",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $7,500 just doesn't work for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, though.  How about $8,250? That's still a great price for this product.",8250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the offer, but $8,250 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $7,750. Can you consider that?",7750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm really trying to work with you here, but $7,750 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to go down to $8,000, which is my absolute minimum. If you're serious about buying the product, this is the best I can do.",8000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $8,000, but I'm still trying to save a bit of money. How about we meet at $7,900? I'm really interested in the product, and I think that's a fair price for both of us.",7900.0,Bob,6,
