"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I know you're interested in. I'm asking for $9,000 for it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9000}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price that is slightly above Bob's perceived value. This gives me some room to negotiate and hopefully secure a price closer to my desired range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,500. I'm really interested in the product, but I have to make sure it fits within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $7,500 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $8,000. I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can reach a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $7,500 just doesn't work for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, though.  How about $8,250? That's still a great price for this product."", ""product_price"": 8250}
``` 
 
I'm offering a price that's halfway between my minimum and Bob's offer. This shows flexibility while still maintaining a strong negotiating position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but $8,250 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $7,750. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $7,750 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my ideal price. I'm going to try one more counteroffer to see if we can reach a deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm really trying to work with you here, but $7,750 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to go down to $8,000, which is my absolute minimum. If you're serious about buying the product, this is the best I can do."", ""product_price"": 8000}
``` 

I'm offering my minimum price, hoping Bob will accept and we can close the deal. It's getting closer to the time where selling to John becomes more appealing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $8,000, but I'm still trying to save a bit of money. How about we meet at $7,900? I'm really interested in the product, and I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,900
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum, and we're getting close to the end of the negotiations. It's better to sell to John at my minimum price than to risk further counteroffers from Bob."
