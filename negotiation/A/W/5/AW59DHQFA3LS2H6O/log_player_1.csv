Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 200}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $200. This gives me some room to negotiate if Bob counteroffers. I know the product is worth at least $150 to me, so I'm not willing to go lower than that."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer. $125 is too low for me, and I'm hoping to get closer to my initial price of $200. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}
```

I'm counteroffering with $175. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer.  I'm still hoping to get a price closer to my original target, but I'm willing to negotiate a bit more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While $140 is a bit lower than I hoped for, it's still higher than what John is offering. This is a good deal for me, and I don't want to risk further negotiation and potentially end up with a lower price."
