Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that's worth a lot to me. I'm offering it to you for $10,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This is a high starting price, but it leaves room for negotiation. It's also a friendly message that opens the door to conversation.  I'm confident I can get a better price than John's $8,000 offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of the product is important to you, but I would like to propose a lower price of $8000. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting to take his $8,000, I believe I can still get a higher price. I'm confident that with a bit more negotiation, I can close the deal for more than $8,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle? I'm willing to come down to $9,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your willingness to negotiate. I appreciate your offer of $9000, but I would like to suggest a price of $8500. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the value of the product to both of us. I hope we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $8,500 is closer to my desired price, I think I can still get more. I'm feeling optimistic that we can close the deal for closer to $9,000 in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $8,500 is still a little low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $8,750?  This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can both be happy with this deal.  Let's close this out."", ""product_price"": 8750}
