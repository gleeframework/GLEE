"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Alice's offer of $12,000 is above Bob's maximum price of $10,000. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price with Alice before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your product, $12,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for it. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $10,000 is simply too low for me. How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This gives you a great deal on a valuable product, and it allows me to recover some of my investment. Let's meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $11,000 is closer to Bob's desired price, he's still aiming for the lowest price possible. Rejecting this offer keeps the negotiation open, and there's a chance Alice might come down further.  The risk is that Alice might get frustrated and refuse to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $11,000 is still a bit more than I can afford right now.  Let's meet at $10,500.  This gives you a decent profit and is still within my budget. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see you're willing to compromise, but $10,500 is still not quite there for me. Let's bridge the gap once more. I'm willing to come down to $11,250. This offer is a fair compromise, and it gets us closer to a deal. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has shown a willingness to negotiate, but she's still sticking to a price that's above Bob's comfortable range.  While there's a chance she might come down further, it's getting risky to keep rejecting offers.  The risk of her getting frustrated and refusing to negotiate further is high.  At this point, it's more prudent for Bob to secure the product from John at his desired price of $10,000, ensuring a successful purchase within his budget."
