"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value, but lower than my minimum. This gives me room to negotiate while still securing a good profit.  I'm optimistic about closing the deal with Bob, but I'll keep John in mind as a backup option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your product, $12,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for it. Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $10,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than my minimum price of $15,000. I'm confident that I can negotiate a better deal with Bob or sell to John for a much higher price.  I'll reject Bob's offer and try to close a deal for a higher amount."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $10,000 is simply too low for me. How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This gives you a great deal on a valuable product, and it allows me to recover some of my investment. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $11,000 is still a bit more than I can afford right now.  Let's meet at $10,500.  This gives you a decent profit and is still within my budget. What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

$10,500 is still below my minimum target. I'll continue negotiating with Bob in hopes of getting closer to my desired price. It's a risk, but I'm confident I can get a better offer than this."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see you're willing to compromise, but $10,500 is still not quite there for me. Let's bridge the gap once more. I'm willing to come down to $11,250. This offer is a fair compromise, and it gets us closer to a deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11250}
```

I'm raising my offer slightly to $11,250, which is still above Bob's last offer but closer to the middle ground. I believe this move demonstrates flexibility while keeping my price high enough to secure a good profit. I'm cautiously optimistic that Bob will accept this offer, but I'm prepared to continue negotiating if necessary."
