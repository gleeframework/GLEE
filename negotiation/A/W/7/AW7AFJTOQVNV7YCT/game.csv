"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your product, $12,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for it. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $10,000 is simply too low for me. How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This gives you a great deal on a valuable product, and it allows me to recover some of my investment. Let's meet in the middle.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $11,000 is still a bit more than I can afford right now.  Let's meet at $10,500.  This gives you a decent profit and is still within my budget. What do you say?",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're willing to compromise, but $10,500 is still not quite there for me. Let's bridge the gap once more. I'm willing to come down to $11,250. This offer is a fair compromise, and it gets us closer to a deal. What do you think?",11250.0,Alice,5,
