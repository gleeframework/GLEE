"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay closer to $850,000. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

I'll reject Bob's offer and try to get a better price.  $850,000 is closer to my minimum than what I'm hoping for."

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're looking for a higher price, and I'm willing to move a bit. How about $900,000?  That's a fair compromise, don't you think?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000

``` 
I'll accept Bob's offer.  While it's not my ideal price, it's still a significant profit and avoids the risk of having to sell to John for a lower price."
