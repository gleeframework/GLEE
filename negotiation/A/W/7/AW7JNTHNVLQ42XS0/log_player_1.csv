Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and compromise on the price. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting, I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price. I'll counter with a slightly lower offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $12,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $16,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and my initial offer.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 16000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your concerns, but $16,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $14,500. I'm trying to find a mutually beneficial price. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's getting closer to my desired price, I'm still not comfortable with $14,500.  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round, aiming for a price closer to $15,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm willing to be flexible.  How about we settle on $15,500? This is a significant compromise on my part, and it's still well above the value you placed on the product. Let's make this deal happen!"", ""product_price"": 15500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $15,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $14,000, and that's as high as I can go. I really like the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me at $14,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $15,000.  While I'd like to get closer to my desired price, it's clear that Bob and I are too far apart.  John is offering a fair price, and it's better to guarantee a sale than risk losing more time and money with Bob."
