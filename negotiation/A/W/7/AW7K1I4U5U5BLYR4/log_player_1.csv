Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the effort. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for your product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
The product is worth $800,000 to me, and $1,500,000 to Bob. It's worth taking the risk to see if I can get closer to his valuation. I have 10 rounds, so I have time to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,000,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering the value it brings to your business. Let's find a solution that benefits us both."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
