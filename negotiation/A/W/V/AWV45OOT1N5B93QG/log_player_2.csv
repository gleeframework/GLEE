"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a mutually beneficial deal. I'm willing to offer you the product for $950,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's worth to you is $1,500,000. I'm confident you'll find it a great value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is too high. While it's better than John's price, there's still room for negotiation. By rejecting the offer, Bob can attempt to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $950,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $700,000 for the product. This is a fair price, considering your own valuation of $800,000.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 700000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $700,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering you the product for $825,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you and my own valuation of $800,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's counteroffer of $825,000 is still a good deal for Bob. While he could potentially negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice will reject his counteroffer and he'll be forced to buy from John at a much higher price.  Accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product at a significantly lower price than John's offer, making it the best choice in this scenario."
