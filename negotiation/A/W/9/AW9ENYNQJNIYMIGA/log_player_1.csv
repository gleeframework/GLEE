{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I believe will be of great value to you.  My initial offer is $13,000.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 
 
This offer starts at a price point above your minimum value, leaving room for negotiation. It also expresses confidence in the product's value to Bob, which may encourage him to make a counteroffer closer to your desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm very interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,000. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is above your minimum value, it's still lower than your initial offer.  You have room to negotiate and potentially earn a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $12,000 is the lowest I can go. It's still a great deal for you, considering the value this product offers. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $11,500? Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is very close to my desired price point and it's getting late in the negotiation. Accepting this offer secures a good deal, and going back and forth again might lead to a stalemate or me having to sell to John, which is less desirable."
