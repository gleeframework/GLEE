# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the purchase of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. As we've discussed, the product is worth $1,500,000 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. I'm confident that you'll find it a great value at this price, and I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $1,200,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $1,100,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a great value for the product. What do you think?

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go below $1,080,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,080,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

Alice is clearly trying to meet in the middle and is unwilling to go much lower.  Accepting at $1,080,000 secures a significant savings compared to John's offer."
