"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value is $1,500,000 to you. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,200,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value to me and the fact that I'm ready to buy now. Let's see if we can close this deal.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,150,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you and the value I place on it. What do you think?",1150000.0,Alice,3,
