"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product, which I believe would greatly benefit you. Given its high value and quality, I think it's worth more than the standard market price. Considering its true worth and your potential satisfaction, I am offering it to you for $135. This price reflects not only its intrinsic value but also ensures you receive the best possible deal. I look forward to your positive response. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is above your maximum budget of $150.** 
* **You can get the product from John for $150, which is still within your budget.**  

Since you're trying to save as much money as possible, it makes sense to reject Alice's offer and buy from John instead."
