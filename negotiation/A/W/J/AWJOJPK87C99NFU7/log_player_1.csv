"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's truly unique and I believe it could be a game-changer for your business. To start, I'm offering it for $2,000,000. I'm confident this is a fair price, but I'm open to discussing it further."", ""product_price"": 2000000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum. This gives me room to negotiate downwards if needed.
* **Emphasis on Value:**  I'm framing the product as valuable and potentially beneficial to Bob's business. This helps him see the potential value beyond just the price.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  I'm signaling that I'm willing to negotiate, which could make Bob more receptive to the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $2000000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1400000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, I'm not willing to sell for that price yet. I believe I can still get a better price by continuing the negotiation.  Rejecting his offer allows me to counter with a higher price and potentially get closer to my goal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position. However, $1,400,000 is significantly lower than the value I've placed on this product.  I'm willing to come down slightly, but I'm still confident it's worth more. How about we meet in the middle at $1,700,000? This would allow both of us to walk away feeling we got a good deal."", ""product_price"": 1700000} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Acknowledging Bob's Position:** I'm showing Bob I'm listening and understanding his perspective. 
* **Emphasizing Value Again:** I'm restating my belief in the product's worth to reinforce its value.
* **Compromise:**  I'm offering a compromise by lowering my price but not going too low.  This helps keep the negotiation moving forward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1700000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1500000 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $1,500,000 is exactly what I would get from John.  Since I have limited rounds and don't want to risk further negotiation potentially leading to a lower price, I'm choosing to sell to John. This ensures I get my minimum desired price and guarantees a sale."
