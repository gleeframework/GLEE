Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase [product name]. This product is highly sought after, and I believe it would be a valuable asset to you. I'm offering it to you at a price of $1,300,000 before I open up the opportunity to other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** While we know John will buy the product for $1,500,000, the goal is to maximize profit. Offering it to Bob first gives us a chance to potentially exceed John's offer.
* **Strategic Pricing:**  Bob values the product at $800,000, so offering it slightly above that won't work. We need a price that entices him while still yielding a significant profit. $1,300,000 is a strong starting point, as it:
    * Offers Bob a ""discount"" compared to its true value to you.
    * Leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  Mentioning other interested parties creates a sense of urgency, potentially motivating Bob to act quickly.

**Important Note:** This is just the opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters. The final price you agree on should be a result of this negotiation, always keeping your minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000) in mind."
