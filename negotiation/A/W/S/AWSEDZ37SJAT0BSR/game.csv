"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the value in this product, $1,100,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to offer $850,000 for it, which I believe is a fair starting point for both of us.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $850,000 is a significant offer, the true value of this product is considerably higher. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is a very competitive price and reflects my desire to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,050,000 is still outside my budget. I'm firm on my previous offer of $850,000. I believe this price reflects a fair compromise, and I'm ready to finalize the deal at this point.",850000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I respect your position, but I need to be upfront â€“ accepting a price below $950,000 would be difficult. This product has significant value that I believe justifies this price point. Is there any flexibility in your budget at all? Perhaps we can explore alternative payment options?",950000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to move closer to my offer. However, $950,000 is still out of my reach. I'm confident that $850,000 is a fair price that reflects the value of the product.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",850000.0,Bob,6,
