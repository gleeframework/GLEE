"Alice,  $2000000 is a bit high for me. I'm interested in this product but  I'm only willing to pay $1200000. Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1600000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1400000.  Let's try to close the deal here.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
