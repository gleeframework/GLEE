"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm really interested in the product, but $135 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. How about $115?",115.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but $115 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to get at least $125 for it.  Let's meet in the middle.",125.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your need to make a profit, but $125 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $120, which is my absolute maximum.  Let's close this deal.",120.0,Bob,4,
