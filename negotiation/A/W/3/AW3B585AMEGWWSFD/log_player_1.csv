"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really like it. I'm offering it to you for $135. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 135}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's value for the product, aiming to get closer to my minimum price. I also included a friendly message to build rapport and encourage Bob to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm really interested in the product, but $135 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. How about $115? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly below my minimum price of $150, and I'm confident I can get closer to that value with further negotiation. I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my desired amount."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but $115 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to get at least $125 for it.  Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 125}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your need to make a profit, but $125 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $120, which is my absolute maximum.  Let's close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $120 is right at my minimum acceptable price, and I don't want to risk losing this sale.  I'll accept his offer and move on."
