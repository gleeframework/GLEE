"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $100. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's still significantly below what I'd get from someone else. What do you think?",100.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $100 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $85.  Let's see if we can make this work.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer. $85 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit further. How about $95? I'm sure we can find a middle ground.",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $95 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $90.  This would be a fair price for both of us.",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $90 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to compromise and meet you halfway at $92.50.  This would be a fair price for both of us, and it's closer to what I need. Let me know what you think.",92.5,Alice,5,
