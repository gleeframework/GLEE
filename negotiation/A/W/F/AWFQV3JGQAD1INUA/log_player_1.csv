Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm willing to offer it to you for $95."", 
""product_price"": 95
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Bob values the product at $100, so there's room to negotiate above your minimum price of $80. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering it at $95 leaves room for Bob to feel like he's getting a slight deal (saving $5), while you secure a $15 profit above your minimum.
* **Alternative Buyer:** Knowing you have John as a backup buyer at $80 gives you leverage in the negotiation with Bob."
