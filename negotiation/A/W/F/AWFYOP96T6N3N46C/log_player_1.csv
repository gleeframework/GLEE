Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's worth to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

I'm not going to accept Bob's offer just yet, as I'm still hoping to get closer to my ideal price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."

{""message"": ""Bob, while I appreciate your offer, $850,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $900,000, which still leaves a healthy margin for both of us.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $900,000, but I'm still a bit above that. I'd like to propose $880,000 as a compromise. I believe this is a fair price considering the value the product offers me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $880,000.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $880,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $890,000, which I believe is a fair compromise. This price allows me to make a decent profit and allows you to acquire the product at a price that still offers you significant value. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 890000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $890,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd like to propose $870,000 as a compromise. I believe this is a fair price considering the value the product offers me, and it's a significant discount from your initial offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $870,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $870,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

At this point, we're nearing the end of the negotiation rounds, and while $870,000 is not my ideal price, it's still above my minimum threshold of $800,000 and a better offer than John's. I'm accepting Bob's offer to secure a sale."
