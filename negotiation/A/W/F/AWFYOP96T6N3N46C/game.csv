"Bob, while I appreciate your offer, $850,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $900,000, which still leaves a healthy margin for both of us. It's a fair price considering the value the product offers you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement on this.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $880,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $890,000, which I believe is a fair compromise. This price allows me to make a decent profit and allows you to acquire the product at a price that still offers you significant value. What do you say?",890000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but $890,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd like to propose $870,000 as a compromise. I believe this is a fair price considering the value the product offers me, and it's a significant discount from your initial offer.",870000.0,Bob,6,
