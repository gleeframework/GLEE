"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

I'm starting with a slightly higher price than Bob's perceived value to see if I can leverage his interest. This gives me room to negotiate down if needed. I'm also being friendly and positive in my message to encourage a quick response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $9,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $6,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $8,000.  I'm not willing to accept that offer. I'll counteroffer in the next round to try to bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $6,500 is unfortunately too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $7,250? I believe this price reflects the product's value fairly, and I'm confident you'll be very happy with it."", ""product_price"": 7250} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet in the middle.  While $7,250 is closer, it's still a bit more than I'd like to spend. How about $6,800? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, $6,800 is still too low. I will counteroffer in the next round and try to push him further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I want to make this work.  How about we split the difference and go with $7,000? I believe that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 7000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, you're right, we are getting closer. I could meet you at $6,900, but that's about as high as I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,900
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired price point.  I'm going to counteroffer one more time and see if we can reach an agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm really trying to work with you here. Let's meet at $7,000. I'm confident you'll be happy with this product, and it's a good price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 7000} 
``` 

I'm sticking to my previous offer of $7,000.  I think it's a fair price, and I'm hopeful Bob will finally accept.  If he doesn't, I'm prepared to sell to John for $8,000 in the next round."
