I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  While I'm getting closer to my minimum, I'm still holding out for a better price. I'll try one more counter-offer before I consider selling to John."

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I've had several rounds of negotiations with Bob, and while he's been willing to negotiate, he's stuck at his initial offer of $8,000.  I've already rejected his offer twice and countered with higher prices, but he's not budging. I'm starting to run out of time, and I don't want to risk losing out completely.  I'm going to sell the product to John for $8,000. It's my minimum, and it's better than getting nothing at all from Bob."
