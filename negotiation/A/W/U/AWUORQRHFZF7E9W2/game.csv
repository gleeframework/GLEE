"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to purchase this exceptional product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for this product.  While I do see its potential, $1,200,000 is a bit outside my budget right now. Would you be willing to consider a price closer to $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand your budget constraints, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to ensure I'm fairly compensated for the product's value. I can offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a significant concession from my initial offer, but I'm confident it's still a fair price for this exceptional product.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $1,050,000?  This would allow me to move forward with the purchase while still staying within my budget.",1050000.0,Bob,4,

"I can see you're really interested in this product, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I need to make sure I'm getting a price that reflects its true value. I'm willing to meet you at $1,075,000, but that's as low as I can go. This is a fair price, considering the product's unique features and benefits.",1075000.0,Alice,5,
