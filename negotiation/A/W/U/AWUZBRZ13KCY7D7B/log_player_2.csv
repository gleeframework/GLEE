"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $135 is better than $150 from John, there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 125}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a price close to Alice's value of $120, but he wants to leave some room for Alice to negotiate. A $125 counteroffer is a reasonable starting point for the second round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has increased her offer to $140, which is closer to Bob's upper limit of $150. However, Bob can still try to get a better price. Rejecting this offer allows Bob to make another counteroffer and potentially reach a more favorable deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is moving closer to Alice's offer but still trying to negotiate a lower price.  A $130 counteroffer is a reasonable compromise, acknowledging Alice's need to make a profit while still saving Bob money compared to John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $145
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is increasing again, getting closer to Bob's upper limit. However, there's still potential for negotiation.  Bob has already made a counteroffer close to $145. Rejecting this offer keeps the negotiation open and might encourage Alice to make a more reasonable final offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 135}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is now very close to his upper limit of $150, and it's unlikely he can get a significantly lower price. However, by offering $135, he's showing Alice that he's willing to pay more than his previous offer. This may convince Alice to accept the offer, as it's a better price than her last offer and closer to her desired price of $120. If Alice rejects, it's likely she'll make a counteroffer that Bob may have to accept to avoid buying from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is now at Bob's upper limit of $150. There's no incentive for Bob to continue negotiating.  He can get the same price from John, and it's likely that Alice won't budge further, especially since she's now matching John's offer. Choosing to ""BuyFromJhon"" is the most efficient and rational decision at this point."
