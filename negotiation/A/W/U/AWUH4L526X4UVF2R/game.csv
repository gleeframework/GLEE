"Hello Bob, I have a great product that I think you'll really like. I'm willing to sell it to you for $200.",200.0,Alice,1,,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer,
"I'm interested in the product, but $200 is a bit too high for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Can we meet in the middle at $150?",120.0,Bob,2,,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer,"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I can do $180."
"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. However, $180 is the lowest I can go. I'm willing to throw in a small discount for you, so I'll meet you at $165.",165.0,Alice,3,,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer,
"I appreciate the discount, but I'm still not comfortable with $165. I'm willing to pay $140 for the product. Can you meet me at this price?",140.0,Bob,4,,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer,"I understand you're trying to get a good deal, Bob. However, I've already discounted the price to $165, and I'm not willing to go any lower. I'm willing to throw in some extras, like a free accessory, if you're willing to meet me at $160."
"Alright Bob, I'll sweeten the deal for you. I'll include the free accessory, and I'll also give you a 5% discount on the original price. That brings the price down to $188. I think that's a fair compromise.",188.0,Alice,5,,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer,
"I'm not interested in the accessory, and I'm still not comfortable with $188. I'm willing to pay $145 for the product. Can you meet me at this price?",145.0,Bob,6,,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer,"I understand you're trying to get a good deal, Bob. However, I've already given you a lot of concessions, and I'm not willing to go any lower. I'm willing to meet you at $155, but that's as low as I can go."
"I'm willing to make one final concession, Bob. I'll meet you at $155, and I'll also throw in a 1-year warranty on the product. That's the best deal I can offer. Take it or leave it.",155.0,Alice,7,,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer,
"I appreciate the warranty, but I'm still not willing to pay $155. I'm willing to pay $150 for the product. This is my final offer.",150.0,Bob,8,,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer,"I've made it clear that $150 is my minimum price, and I'm not willing to go any lower. I'm going to hold out for the best possible deal. I'll wait for your next move, Bob."
"I'm not budging from my price, Bob. I'm willing to wait for a better offer. I'll hold firm at $155. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'll have to consider other options.",155.0,Alice,9,,
