"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're looking for a more reasonable price, and I'm willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial agreement. However, considering the product's value and the time and effort that has gone into creating it, I'm not comfortable going as low as $950000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1100000. This is a significant discount from the original price, and I believe it's a fair compromise.
