"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. It's a unique opportunity to own something truly valuable. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is too high. While it's within your budget, it's still much higher than the product's value to her. It's worth negotiating to see if you can get a better price.  You have 10 rounds to work with, so there's room to counteroffer and try to reach a mutually beneficial deal."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me at this point. I'm willing to offer $900,000 for it. This reflects the value I see in it and leaves room for a fair profit for you. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive Opening:** This counteroffer starts the negotiation aggressively, demonstrating your willingness to negotiate.
