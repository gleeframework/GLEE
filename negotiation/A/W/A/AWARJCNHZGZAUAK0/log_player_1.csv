"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. It's a valuable piece and I know you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 13000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $13,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $11,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $11,000 is better than selling to John, I'm still aiming for a higher price.  I'll counter Bob's offer in the next round, hoping to close the deal closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a bit above that price point. How about we meet in the middle at $12,000?  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $12,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $11,500. Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $11,500 is getting closer to my desired price.  While I'd prefer more, accepting this offer is still better than selling to John for $10,000.  It's also a good sign that Bob is willing to negotiate and that we're making progress."
