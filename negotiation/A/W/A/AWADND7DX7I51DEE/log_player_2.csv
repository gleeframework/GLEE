"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be interested in. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to let it go for $125.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:**  Alice is offering the product for $125, while John wants $150. 
* **You're still saving money:** Even though you're paying more than the product is worth to Alice ($100), you're still saving $25 compared to buying from John."
