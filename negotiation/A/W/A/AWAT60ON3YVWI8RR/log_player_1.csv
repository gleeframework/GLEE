Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm offering you this product for $100. It's a great deal, considering its value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 
 
This offer allows for some negotiation space while still ensuring I get a good price. It's higher than my minimum but leaves room for a counteroffer if Bob is looking for a better deal.  If he rejects, I'll reassess based on his counteroffer, and if needed, I'll consider selling to John for $80."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate it, but I can't agree to $100. Considering the product's value to me, I would like to propose $90 as my offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is close to my desired price, and it's higher than John's offer. Accepting his offer is the best strategy in this situation."
