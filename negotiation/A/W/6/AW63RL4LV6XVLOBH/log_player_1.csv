I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $70 is better than $50, I'm still hoping to get closer to my desired price. I believe I have time to negotiate further with Bob."

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

At this point, I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While I'd still prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, I'm running out of rounds. Accepting $80 is better than selling to John for $150, and it also gives me some flexibility in case Bob wants to renegotiate in the future."
