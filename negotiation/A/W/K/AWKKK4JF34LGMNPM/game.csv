"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. As we're just getting started, I'd like to make you an initial offer of $1,300,000. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm confident you'll find this price to be a great value.",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $1,300,000 is a bit high for me. Could you do $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,100,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you a price of $1,200,000. I think this is a fair compromise considering the value this product brings. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,3,
