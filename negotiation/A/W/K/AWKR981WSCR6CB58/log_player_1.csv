Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really enjoy it. I'm offering it to you for $140. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's value:**  $140 is still higher than what the product is worth to Bob ($120), giving him incentive to negotiate.
* **It's below your minimum:**  It's still above your minimum price of $150, ensuring you make a profit.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  This price leaves room for both you and Bob to adjust and potentially reach a mutually agreeable solution."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $125. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $125 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $150. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and I'm willing to negotiate. However, $125 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $132.50? It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 132.50}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $132.50 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $130? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While $130 is still below my ideal price, it's getting closer to my minimum of $150.  Since Bob seems firm at this price, accepting his offer is the best option in this scenario.  It allows me to sell the product and avoid the risk of further negotiation or selling to John for a lower profit."
