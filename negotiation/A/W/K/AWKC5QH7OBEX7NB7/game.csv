"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm not comfortable with the initial price of $1,100,000. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product, considering its value to me is capped at $800,000.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, but the product's value is significantly higher than your offer. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.  This is a very competitive price considering its true worth.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $950,000 is closer to your valuation,  the product's inherent value justifies a higher price. I'm willing to accept a final offer of $1,000,000. This is a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair deal for both of us.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
