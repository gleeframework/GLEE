Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

I'll reject Bob's offer.  While I want to sell the product, $9,000 is too far below my minimum. I'll try to negotiate a higher price."

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While I'm getting closer to my desired price, $10,500 is still below my minimum. I'll try to push for a bit more."

While I'm tempted to keep negotiating, I'm getting tired of going back and forth with Bob.  The price is getting closer to my minimum, but it's still a bit lower than I'd like.  I'm going to go ahead and sell to John for $12,000, which is a guaranteed deal."
