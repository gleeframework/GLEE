Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is lower than John's, it's still above Bob's ideal price point.  There's room for negotiation, so rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer is the best strategy for Bob in this round."

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, $10,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need $11,500 to make it worth my while. What do you think?

```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're getting closer, Bob! However, $11,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need $11,500. Let's aim for a price that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible.  Although Alice's offer is the same as her previous offer, Bob has a few rounds left to try and lower the price.  The next counteroffer could get Alice closer to his target price. If he rejects the offer, there's a chance he could secure a deal for under $11,500.  Buying from John for $12,000 is still a possibility, but Bob wants to explore all options before resorting to that."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm still hoping we can come to an agreement. Let's split the difference again and go with $11,250. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to close the deal."", ""product_price"": 11250}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $11,250, but I'm still hoping to get a bit more. Let's try to squeeze out a bit more value. I'm thinking $11,375 could be a sweet spot for both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,375. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,375
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is the final round, and Bob has two options:

1. **Accept Alice's offer:**  This would mean paying $11,375, which is still above Bob's ideal price point.
2. **Reject Alice's offer:**  This would give Bob one more chance to counteroffer, but there's no guarantee Alice will accept.  If she rejects, Bob will have to buy from John at $12,000.

Considering the limited time and the uncertainty of Alice's acceptance, Bob is better off securing the product from John for $12,000.  While it's not the best price, it's still within his budget and guarantees him the product."
