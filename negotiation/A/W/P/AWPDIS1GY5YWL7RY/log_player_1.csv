"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1700000} 
```

I'm starting high, aiming for a good profit.  Since the product is worth $1,500,000 to me, I need to leave room for negotiation. Bob will likely reject this offer, but it sets the stage for our back-and-forth."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,200,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than what I need to make this worthwhile. I'll counteroffer and see if we can come to a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

I'm lowering my price to $1,500,000. This is the minimum I'm willing to accept, as it aligns with my own valuation of the product. I'm hoping Bob will see the value and accept this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While I'm getting closer to my minimum, I still think I can get a better price. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, but if we can't reach an agreement, I'll sell to John for $1,500,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000} 
```

I'm lowering my price again to $1,400,000. This is still a good profit for me, and I'm hoping Bob will see the value in getting a deal at this price. It's getting closer to his value of $800,000 and may make him consider accepting."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

We're getting close to my minimum, but Bob's offer is still too low.  It's not worth continuing to negotiate with him.  It's time to sell to John and guarantee a decent profit."
