,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $70 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $85? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",85.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I'm glad we are narrowing down the price. How about we meet in the middle at $78?",78.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $78 is still a bit too low for me. How about $82? That's only $4 away from your last offer and closer to what I need to make this worthwhile. Let's see if we can close this deal!",82.0,Alice,5,
