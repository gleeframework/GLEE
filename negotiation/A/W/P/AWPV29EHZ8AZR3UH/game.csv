"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. However, my initial offer was a fair price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I can do $110, but that's as low as I can go.",110.0,Alice,3,,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but $95 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to make sure I'm not losing money on this deal. I can do $100, but that's as low as I can go.",100.0,Alice,5,,
