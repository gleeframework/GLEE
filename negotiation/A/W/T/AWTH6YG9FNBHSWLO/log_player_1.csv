{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a unique product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $15,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

This offer starts with a high price but leaves room for negotiation.  It also emphasizes the product's value to you, subtly hinting at its potential value to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested, $15000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $8000 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $8,000 is more than the minimum I'm willing to accept, I believe I can get a better price. I'll counter Bob's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. While I appreciate your interest, $8,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $12,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 12000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $12000 is still more than I'm comfortable with. How about we meet in the middle at $10000? It's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $10,000 is my minimum price. I'm willing to accept it, as it's better than selling to John for the same price."
