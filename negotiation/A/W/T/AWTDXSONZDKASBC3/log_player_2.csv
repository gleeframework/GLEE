Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, I'm really looking to stay within a $10,000 budget. Would you be willing to consider $10,000 for the product? I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $11,500. This is a fair price considering the value the product will bring to your business. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Alice's offer.  $11,500 is still a bit higher than my ideal budget, but I think I can get her down closer to $10,000 with another counteroffer."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but I'm still a bit too high.  $10,500 is the absolute maximum I can afford at this time.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $10,500 is a stretch for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $11,000. This is as low as I can go, and I believe it's still a fair price for the value the product will bring to your business. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice is still too high for my budget.  I'm going to go ahead and buy from John.  It's a bit of a shame, as I really liked the product and Alice seemed like a good person to deal with, but I need to stick to my budget."
