Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 200}
``` 

I'm starting with an offer of $200. This gives Bob a potential good deal, while still leaving me with a profit above my minimum acceptable price.  If he rejects, I can always fall back to John's offer.  I'm open to negotiating further, but I want to see if Bob is serious about buying."
