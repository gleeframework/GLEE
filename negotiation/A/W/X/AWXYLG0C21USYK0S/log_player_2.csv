"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the product for a special price of $1,400,000. This is a great opportunity for you to get your hands on this valuable item, and I think you'll be happy with the price I'm offering. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While Alice's offer is lower than the product's value to her, it's still higher than Bob's maximum budget.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to buy the product from John for a lower price, achieving his goal of saving money."
