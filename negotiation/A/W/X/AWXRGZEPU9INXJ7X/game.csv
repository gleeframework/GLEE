,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm really interested in the product, but $150 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",120.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $120 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise.  How about $135?  That gives us both some room to be happy with the deal.",135.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $135 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $130. Is that something you'd be willing to accept?",130.0,Bob,4,
