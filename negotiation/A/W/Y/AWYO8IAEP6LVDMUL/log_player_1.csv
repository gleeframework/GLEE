Round 2
Bob's offer:

I'm going to reject Bob's offer, as it is significantly lower than my desired price. I want to see if I can get closer to my goal."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  $9,000 is a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to $11,000 to make this work.  Let's meet in the middle.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11000}

Round 4

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the compromise, but I'm still a bit higher than $10,500. How about we try $10,250? I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to be careful with my budget.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While it's not my ideal price, it's a good deal considering the circumstances.  I've already rejected a few offers, and with limited rounds remaining, I need to secure a sale.  $10,250 is still well above my minimum threshold, so it's a good outcome."
