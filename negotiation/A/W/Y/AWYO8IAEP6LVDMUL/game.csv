"Bob,  $9,000 is a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to $11,000 to make this work.  Let's meet in the middle.  What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit higher than $11,000. How about we try $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're still a bit hesitant. Let's try to bridge the gap. How about $10,500? That's a fair compromise, and it gets us closer to a deal. Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate the compromise, but I'm still a bit higher than $10,500. How about we try $10,250? I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to be careful with my budget.",10250.0,Bob,6,
