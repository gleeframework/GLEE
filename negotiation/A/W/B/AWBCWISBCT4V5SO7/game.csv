"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think $2,000,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the market conditions.",1400000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your interest and counter-offer, Bob.  While $2,000,000 represents the high end of the product's value range, I understand your perspective. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,700,000. This adjustment reflects my willingness to negotiate, but also maintains a fair value for this unique product.",1700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for considering my previous offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,700,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $1,500,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and our previous discussions.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
