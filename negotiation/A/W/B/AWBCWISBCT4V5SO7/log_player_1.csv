"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,000,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and the value it can bring to you."", 
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to begin negotiations with a price higher than your desired outcome. This allows room for negotiation and signals that you value the product highly. 
* **Justification:**  By mentioning ""potential"" and ""value,"" the message subtly emphasizes the benefits to Bob, justifying the high initial price. 
* **Leaving Room:**  While the initial offer is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value, it leaves ample space for negotiation over the subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think $2,000,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the market conditions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,400,000 is tempting as it's above his perceived value, it's still below both your minimum and John's standing offer. You have room to negotiate further and try to close the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate your interest and counter-offer, Bob.  While $2,000,000 represents the high end of the product's value range, I understand your perspective. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,700,000. This adjustment reflects my willingness to negotiate, but also maintains a fair value for this unique product."", 
""product_price"": 1700000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** Coming down by $300,000 is a significant concession, signaling to Bob that you are serious about reaching a deal. 
* **Holding Ground:**  The counteroffer still sits comfortably above both Bob's perceived value and John's offer, providing negotiating leverage.
* **Reiterating Value:** The message continues to subtly highlight the product's uniqueness and value, subtly pushing against further lowballs."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my previous offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,700,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $1,500,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and our previous discussions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has now met your minimum acceptable price, which also matches John's standing offer.  There's no strategic advantage to further negotiation at this point.  Accepting the offer secures the best possible outcome in this scenario."
