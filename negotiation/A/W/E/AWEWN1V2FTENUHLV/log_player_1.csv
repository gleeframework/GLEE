Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're willing to sell for $1,200,000 (your value).
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob.
* **Your Leverage:** You have a guaranteed buyer (John) at your minimum price.

**Strategy**

You want to maximize your profit, so aiming close to Bob's $1,500,000 valuation is ideal. However, being too aggressive could make Bob walk away.

**Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exclusive opportunity to acquire the product.  Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. I believe this reflects a fair deal considering the significant benefits it offers."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Message:** The message is framed positively, highlighting the ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""unique value.""
* **Price:**  $1,400,000 leaves room for Bob to potentially negotiate down slightly while still netting you a significant profit above your minimum.

**Why this approach?**

* **Strong Opening:**  It sets a high anchor point for the negotiation.
* **Leaves Room:**  It allows for some negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.
* **Respectful but Firm:** It shows you value the product while acknowledging Bob's interest.

**Important Note:**  Negotiation is dynamic. Be prepared to adjust your approach based on Bob's response."
