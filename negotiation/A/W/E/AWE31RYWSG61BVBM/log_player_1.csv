"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. I'm interested, but I'd be willing to pay closer to $800,000 for it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

 Bob's offer is too low. I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm not going to sell for that price just yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest but $800,000 is significantly below what I'm looking for.  How about we meet in the middle? I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This leaves room for both of us to get a good deal. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $950,000 is closer, but I need to be mindful of my budget. How about $875,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $875,000 is closer to my target, it's still too low. I'm going to try and squeeze a bit more out of Bob before considering selling to John."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I'm not willing to go as low as $875,000, I am willing to come down to $925,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows for a successful deal for both of us. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 925000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you've been very reasonable, and I respect that. Let's settle this.  $900,000, and we have a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer of $900,000 is a good compromise. While I'd prefer more, it's a solid deal and within the range I'm willing to accept. It's also better than selling to John for $1,000,000."
