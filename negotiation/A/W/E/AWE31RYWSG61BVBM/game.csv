"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. I'm interested, but I'd be willing to pay closer to $800,000 for it. What do you think?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $800,000 is significantly below what I'm looking for.  How about we meet in the middle? I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This leaves room for both of us to get a good deal. Let me know if you're interested.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $950,000 is closer, but I need to be mindful of my budget. How about $875,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",875000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I'm not willing to go as low as $875,000, I am willing to come down to $925,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows for a successful deal for both of us. Let me know if you're interested.",925000.0,Alice,5,
