Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly.  Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $18,000. I believe this to be a fair offer considering its worth.  What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 18000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $15,000, you have leverage. Starting with a higher offer of $18,000 allows room for negotiation and potentially a higher profit margin.
* **Justification:** Providing a reason (""given its value"") makes the initial price seem less arbitrary.
* **Open for Negotiation:**  The tone suggests you're open to discussion and finding a price that works for both of you, encouraging Bob to engage. 

**Important Note:** While you have a fallback option, pushing Bob too hard with an unreasonable price might make him walk away entirely. This approach aims for a balance between maximizing profit and securing the sale."
