"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that's worth a lot to me. I'm offering it to you for $15000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll see its value. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Since the product is worth no more than $15,000 to Bob, accepting Alice's offer is not a good strategy. There is no benefit in buying from Alice at her asking price.  Rejecting the offer gives Bob the opportunity to try and negotiate a lower price. While there's no guarantee Bob will get a better deal, it's a better strategy than accepting Alice's offer."

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product,  $15,000 is a bit higher than my budget. Would you be willing to consider $12,000?  I'm genuinely interested in this, but I need to stay within my price range."", ""product_price"": 12000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints.  While $12000 is a fair offer, I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my asking price. How about we meet in the middle at $13500?  I'm confident this product will be worth it for you, and I'm willing to be flexible to make this deal work. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $13,500 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, it's still above Bob's maximum budget.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue negotiating and potentially get a price closer to his desired $12,000.  Buying from John at this point would be a worse outcome."
