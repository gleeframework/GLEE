Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $7500. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.,7500.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity to buy from you. However, $7500 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $7000 for the product. Let me know what you think.",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $7250. I think this is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you.",7250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  $7250 is getting closer, but I'm still a bit stretched.  How about $7100?  That's a fair compromise that should work for both of us.",7100.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your willingness to compromise, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $7100. I'm willing to make another counteroffer: $7200. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to you.",7200.0,Alice,5,
