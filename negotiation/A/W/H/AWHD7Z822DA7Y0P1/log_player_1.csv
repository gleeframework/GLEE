Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my previous offer, Alice. I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $1,600,000. I think that's a fair price considering the value of the product.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm afraid I can't go any higher than $1,600,000. That's the highest I'm willing to pay for this product. I'd like to make one final offer to you. If you're willing to meet me at $1,600,000, I'll consider it a done deal.

While I could push for more, Bob is unlikely to budge from his $1,600,000 offer. Accepting this offer nets me a greater profit than selling to John for $1,500,000."
