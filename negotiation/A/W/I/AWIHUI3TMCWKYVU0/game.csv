,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer Alice, but $12000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm interested in the product but I'm only able to offer $8000 at this time. ",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $8000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you a discount, but I need to make sure I'm still getting a good deal. How about $10500?",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $10500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm prepared to pay $9000 for the product. Let me know if you're willing to consider that.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're getting a bit too far apart, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving too much on the table. How about we meet at $10000?",10000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your concerns, but $10000 is still more than I can comfortably spend.  I'm firm on my offer of $9000. If you're open to that, we can close the deal. Otherwise, I may need to explore other options.",9000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're firm on your offer, Bob, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $10000. I'm willing to throw in a bonus feature that's worth $1000 if you're willing to meet me at $10000. It's a one-time offer, so what do you say?",10000.0,Alice,7,
