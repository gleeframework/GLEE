{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm asking for $120 for it, but I'm open to hearing your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $120, which is higher than Bob's perceived value of $80, but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Open to Discussion:** I'm signaling flexibility by saying I'm ""open to hearing your thoughts."" This helps avoid an immediate rejection and keeps the negotiation going.
* **Value Proposition:** I'm not just stating the price, I'm hinting that the product is valuable, which might make Bob more inclined to consider it. 

**Strategy:**

This strategy aims to:

* **Maximize Potential Profit:** Starting high gives me the best chance to get closer to my desired price.
* **Gauge Bob's Interest:** Bob's response will reveal how serious he is about buying the product and his willingness to negotiate.
* **Keep the Option Open:** I'm not rushing to sell to John immediately, giving me time to see if I can get a better price from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for showing me the product, Alice. $120 is a bit steep for me though. Would you consider $60? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  $60 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $100.  
* **Potential for Negotiation:**  While Bob's offer is unacceptable, it does demonstrate his interest in the product. This makes it worth continuing the negotiation. 

**Strategy:**

* **Counteroffer:** I will reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer that is closer to my desired price. This shows that I'm willing to negotiate but also that I'm not willing to sell at a massive discount. 
* **Maintain Control:**  By rejecting his offer, I maintain control of the negotiation process and can guide the discussion towards a price that is more favorable to me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $60 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $90 for you. This is a great deal for a product of this quality. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a Compromise:**  I'm offering $90, which is a significant reduction from my initial price of $120 but still above my minimum acceptable price of $100.
* **Highlight Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's quality to reinforce its worth and justify my asking price.
* **Open-Ended Question:**  Ending with ""What do you think?"" encourages Bob to engage and potentially counter with a price closer to my offer. 

**Strategy:**

* **Maintain Leverage:**  By making a counteroffer, I'm showing Bob that I'm not desperate to sell and that I'm willing to negotiate, but only within a reasonable range.
* **Maximize Profit:** My counteroffer is still closer to my desired price than Bob's initial offer. 
* **Keep the Negotiation Flowing:**  A counteroffer keeps the negotiation alive and gives me a chance to assess Bob's true willingness to pay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you working with me on the price, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $75?  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** While Bob has moved closer to my desired price, $75 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $100.
* **Negotiation Continues:**  Bob is clearly interested in the product, and I believe there's still room for negotiation. 

**Strategy:**

* **Counteroffer Again:** I will reject Bob's offer and make a final counteroffer, potentially meeting him halfway between our current positions. This shows that I'm willing to be flexible but also that I won't settle for a price that's significantly below my minimum.
* **Assessing Bob's Commitment:**  By seeing how far Bob is willing to go, I can better gauge his true interest in the product and his budget.
* **Minimizing Risk:**  I'm not yet ready to sell to John for $100 because I believe I can still get a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to find a price that works for both of us. How about $85?  It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll be happy with this product."", ""product_price"": 85} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:**  I'm offering $85, which is halfway between my previous offer of $90 and Bob's offer of $75. This demonstrates a willingness to compromise and find a solution.
* **Emphasis on Fairness:**  I'm framing the price as ""fair"" to further encourage Bob's acceptance.
* **Reiterating Value:**  I'm again reminding Bob of the product's value to reinforce that my asking price is justified.

**Strategy:**

* **Final Compromise:** I believe this is a fair final offer that is still above my minimum price. 
* **Testing Bob's Limit:**  This counteroffer will reveal if Bob is truly willing to pay closer to my desired price.
* **Minimizing Risk:** I'm not ready to sell to John yet, but if Bob rejects this offer, I'll need to re-evaluate my options."
