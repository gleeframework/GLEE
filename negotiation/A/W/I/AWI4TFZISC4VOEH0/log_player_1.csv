Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this excellent product. I believe it will be highly beneficial for you.  Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing the backup:** You have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, which sets your minimum acceptable price.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** Starting high but below your minimum ($1,150,000) allows for potential negotiation while still aiming for a significant profit.
* **Highlighting value:**  The message focuses on the product's benefits to Bob, subtly justifying the high price. 

This approach maximizes your chances of:

1. **Bob accepting:** The price, while high, might be tempting if Bob perceives significant value in the product.
2. **Negotiating a higher price:**  Even if Bob counters, the starting point allows room to negotiate down towards your minimum and still get a better deal than John offers."
