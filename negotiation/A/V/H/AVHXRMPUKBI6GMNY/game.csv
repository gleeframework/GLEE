"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11500. It's a fantastic deal, and I believe it's worth every penny. Let me know what you think!",11500.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10800. I'm willing to pay a bit above market value, but I need to stay within my budget.",10800.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $10800 is simply too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $11150? It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows me to make a reasonable profit.  Let me know what you think.",11150.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit above my budget. How about we try $10500? I think that's a fair price for the product, and it's the highest I can go.",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $10500 is simply too low for me to consider. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to at least get $10900. This would be a fair price for both of us. Let's try to find a compromise here.",10900.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $10900 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $10450. This is the lowest I can go, and I hope we can agree on this price.",10450.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working within your budget, but $10450 is still below my minimum. Let's split the difference and go with $10725. This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy. What do you say?",10725.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $10725 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay a premium, but I need to stay within my budget. How about we try $10400? This is the lowest I can go, and I hope we can agree on this price.",10400.0,Bob,8,
