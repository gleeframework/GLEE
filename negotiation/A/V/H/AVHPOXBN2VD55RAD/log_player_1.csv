Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $115."", ""product_price"": 115}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  You want to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($120) as possible without losing the sale.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $115 leaves some wiggle room if Bob tries to negotiate down. 
* **Ensure a Profit Over Alternative:**  This price ensures you make a $15 profit over selling to John for your minimum acceptable price ($100)."
