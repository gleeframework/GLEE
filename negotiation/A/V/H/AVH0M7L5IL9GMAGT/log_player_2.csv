"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for our discussion.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer is way above your maximum price. It's time to negotiate!"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. I'm willing to offer $800,000 for the product."",
""product_price"": 800000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** We're starting significantly below Alice's asking price but well within your budget. This leaves room for negotiation while signaling you're a serious buyer. 
* **Aiming for a Good Deal:** The goal is to get the product for a price significantly lower than John's offer ($1,000,000).
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffers:** Alice is likely to counter, and this initial offer gives us space to move up if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you getting back to me.  While your initial offer is lower than I'd hoped for, I'm willing to negotiate.  To find a middle ground, I'm proposing a revised price of $1,900,000.  I believe this price reflects the true value of the product and allows both of us to benefit. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too High:** Alice's counteroffer is better but still significantly above your $1,000,000 limit and John's offer. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** Her willingness to negotiate suggests we can bring the price down further.
* **Leveraging John's Offer:**  We have a backup option with John, which gives us leverage in the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for coming down on the price. However, $1,900,000 is still more than I'm comfortable paying. I can go as high as $1,100,000. This offer reflects how serious I am about purchasing this product."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Increase:**  We're increasing our offer by a substantial $300,000, demonstrating our willingness to move towards a deal.
* **Staying Competitive:**  The offer is still slightly above John's price, but it keeps us in the running with Alice.
* **Testing the Waters:** This counteroffer will give us a better idea of Alice's flexibility and how low she might be willing to go."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I understand you're working within a budget, however, the product's value is significant.  I can come down to $1,600,000,  This is my final offer, and I believe it represents a fair deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** Alice has stated this is her final offer.
* **Still Too High:** Even with the reduction, $1,600,000 is significantly more than John's $1,000,000 price. 
* **No More Room to Negotiate:** It's unlikely Alice will come down further, and we've already shown our hand with a $1,100,000 offer.

It's time to cut our losses and go with the guaranteed deal from John."
