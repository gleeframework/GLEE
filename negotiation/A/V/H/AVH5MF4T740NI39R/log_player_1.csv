"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really love.  I'm asking for $115 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value ($100) but still lower than my minimum ($120). This gives room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Tone:**  The message is friendly and positive to build rapport and encourage Bob to consider the offer. 
* **Room for Counteroffers:**  $115 leaves space for Bob to make a counteroffer without feeling like he's being forced into a bad deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $115 is a little steep for me. Would you consider $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** $90 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $120. 
* **Negotiation Potential:** While I could sell to John for $120, there's still room for negotiation with Bob.  I can likely get a better price than $90.
* **Maintain Leverage:** By rejecting his offer, I keep the power in the negotiation and signal that I'm not desperate to sell."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you're interested.  $90 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit.  How about $105? That's a fair price that allows us both to get a good deal."", ""product_price"": 105} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a Compromise:** I'm meeting Bob halfway by lowering my price from $115 to $105. This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate.
* **Maintain a Profit Margin:** $105 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $120, ensuring I make a profit. 
* **Positive Tone:**  The message remains friendly and encourages Bob to see the value in my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you have to make a profit, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $97? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $97. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $97
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** While $97 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below my desired profit margin.
* **Continued Negotiation:**  There's still room to negotiate, and I believe I can push Bob higher. 
* **Leverage:** By rejecting his offer, I maintain my leverage and signal that I'm not desperate for a quick sale."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you trying to find a solution.  $97 is still a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $101?  This would be a fair price that benefits us both."", ""product_price"": 101} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise and Persistence:** I'm offering a compromise by splitting the difference between my previous offer ($105) and Bob's offer ($97). This shows continued willingness to negotiate while staying closer to my desired price point.
* **Maintain Profit:** $101 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $120, ensuring a profit for me.
* **Positive and Solution-Oriented:**  The message remains friendly and focuses on finding a solution that works for both parties."
