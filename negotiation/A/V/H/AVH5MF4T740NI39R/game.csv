"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $115 is a little steep for me. Would you consider $90?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you're interested.  $90 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit.  How about $105? That's a fair price that allows us both to get a good deal.",105.0,Alice,3,

,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you trying to find a solution.  $97 is still a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $101?  This would be a fair price that benefits us both.",101.0,Alice,5,
