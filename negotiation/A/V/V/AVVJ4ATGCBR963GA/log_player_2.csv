"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be perfect for you and I'm asking for $10,000.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save money. Alice's initial offer of $10,000 is above Bob's maximum budget. It's better to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit out of my range. I'd be happy to pay $7,000 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 7000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a lower offer, hoping to push Alice towards a compromise. This offer is within Bob's budget and below Alice's minimum price, setting the stage for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but I can't go lower than $9,000. This product is truly worth it, and I'm confident you'd get great value from it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $9,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his desired price point. It's worth continuing to negotiate to see if Alice will budge further.  There are still several rounds left, so Bob has room to try to push for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $9,000 is still a bit too high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $8,500?  This would be a fair price for both of us and would allow me to move forward with the purchase."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his offer slightly to show good faith and demonstrate his willingness to negotiate. This counteroffer is a middle ground between Bob's previous offer and Alice's current offer, suggesting a potential compromise."
