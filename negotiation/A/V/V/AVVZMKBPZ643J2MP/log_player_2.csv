"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am excited to present our flagship product, which has been meticulously designed and developed to meet your specific needs. This product holds immense value to us, but given its importance to you, we believe it's worth sharing with you at a special price. We are offering this exceptional product to you for $12,000. We are confident that this investment will not only meet but exceed your expectations. Should you have any questions or require further information, please do not hesitate to reach out. Looking forward to the possibility of bringing this valuable solution to your organization. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $12,000 is lower than John's price of $15,000, there's room for negotiation.  Since the product is only worth $10,000 to Alice, she might be willing to go lower. By rejecting this offer, Bob signals that he's looking for a better deal and might incentivize Alice to propose a lower price."
