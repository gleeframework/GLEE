"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested in the product, $12,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it. Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $9,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $11,000. It's a fair compromise, considering the value this product brings. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11,000 is still beyond what I'm comfortable spending.  I'm confident this product is worth a lot, but my maximum is $10,000. I'm hoping we can find a way to make this work.",10000.0,Bob,4,

"I can see you're really interested in this product, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $10,000, but I need to make a profit. I'm thinking of a price of $10,500. It's a slight increase, but I believe it's still a fair deal for both of us. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,5,
