"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I've done some research and I believe that's a fair price considering the market value. Would you be willing to meet me at this price?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While I understand your offer, it's significantly lower than what I'm willing to accept.  How about we split the difference?  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product and the market conditions.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,300,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer of $1,200,000. How about we meet at $1,250,000?",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,250,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000 as a final compromise.  This reflects the value of the product and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement.  Let's finalize this deal.",1350000.0,Alice,5,
