{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. This is a great price considering the value it holds. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Target Price:**  My ideal price is $1,500,000. 
* **Bob's Value:**  I know Bob values the product at $1,200,000. 
* **Starting Point:**  I'm starting with a price slightly lower than my ideal but still higher than Bob's perceived value.  This is a good starting point to see if he's willing to negotiate.
* **Flexibility:** I'm leaving room to negotiate if Bob makes a counteroffer, but I'm also prepared to walk away and sell to John if the negotiations don't work out in my favor."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I've done some research and I believe that's a fair price considering the market value. Would you be willing to meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:** Bob is offering the minimum he's willing to pay. This is far below my minimum acceptable price.
* **Selling to John:** While selling to John for $1,500,000 is the most ideal outcome, it's still worth exploring if I can get closer to that price with Bob.
* **Negotiation Strategy:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I maintain my leverage and signal that I'm not desperate to sell at his price.  It allows me to make a counteroffer that's closer to my target price."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While I understand your offer, it's significantly lower than what I'm willing to accept.  How about we split the difference?  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product and the market conditions."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a compromise by splitting the difference between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. This shows a willingness to negotiate.
* **Justification:** I'm providing a reason for my counteroffer by highlighting the value of the product and market conditions.
* **Maintaining Leverage:** I'm still above Bob's initial offer, which maintains some leverage in the negotiation.
* **Room for Negotiation:**  If Bob rejects this offer, I can adjust my counteroffer further, but I'm aiming to get as close to my desired price as possible."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,300,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer of $1,200,000. How about we meet at $1,250,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close, but Not Enough:** While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still not enough for me to accept. 
* **Maintain Leverage:** Rejecting his offer allows me to keep negotiating and potentially get a better price.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  The risk is that Bob walks away. The reward is that I might be able to secure a higher price with another counteroffer. 
* **Selling to John:**  Selling to John for $1,500,000 is still the ideal outcome, but I'm willing to continue with Bob for now, as there's a chance I can get closer to that price."
