"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this valuable product from me. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $1,200,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to save a bit more.  I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product.  This reflects its value to me and allows for a fair profit for you.  Let me know what you think.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your desire to save a bit more, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,150,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value to me. What do you think?",1150000.0,Alice,3,
