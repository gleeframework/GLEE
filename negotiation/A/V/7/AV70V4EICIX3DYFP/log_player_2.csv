Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your continued interest in our product, Bob. After careful consideration, we've decided to adjust our offer slightly. We're now willing to sell the product to you for $12,800. This price reflects a compromise between our original asking price and your counteroffer, aiming to ensure a mutually beneficial transaction. We hope this revised offer meets your expectations and allows us to reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  Alice has come down to $12,800, which is only $300 more than Bob's counteroffer of $12,500. This is a good deal for Bob, as he's saving $2,200 compared to buying from John. There are still rounds left, but the risk of Alice walking away or Bob needing to pay John's higher price outweighs the potential for saving a few hundred dollars more."
