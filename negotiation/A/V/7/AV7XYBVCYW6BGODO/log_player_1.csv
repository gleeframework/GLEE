"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,700,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value it holds.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1700000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, but still leaving room for negotiation.  
* **Strong Opening:** A clear message emphasizes the value of the product and sets a positive tone.
* **Leaving Room:**  A $900,000 difference gives me space to negotiate and hopefully reach a price closer to my desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's quite a high starting point. I'm more interested in a price closer to  $850,000.  Do you think we can find some middle ground there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is significantly below my minimum acceptable price.** While I'm open to negotiation, I'm not willing to sell for less than $1,500,000. 
* **I have 9 more rounds to negotiate.** It's important to try and secure a price closer to my desired value before potentially selling to John. 
* **Rejecting allows me to counteroffer and steer the negotiation towards a more favorable price.**"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm aiming for a price closer to $1,200,000.  That still leaves a good amount of room for profit for you, and it's a price that reflects the true value of this product.  Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** This counteroffer is a significant step down from my initial offer but still far above Bob's current proposal. It shows a willingness to negotiate but also maintains my position of not selling for less than $1,500,000. 
* **Appeal to Value:** I'm emphasizing the value of the product for Bob, reminding him of the potential profit he could make. 
* **Collaboration:** Using phrases like ""work together"" and ""benefits both of us"" fosters a more positive and cooperative atmosphere."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the value you see in the product, but I have a budget in mind. Would you consider $950,000? It's a significant step from my previous offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:** $950,000 is still far below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  
* **More negotiation potential:** I have 6 rounds left, and I'm confident that I can find a better deal. 
* **Focus on value:** I'm aiming to highlight the value of the product and push for a price that reflects its true worth."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  While $950,000 is an improvement, I'm still aiming for a price closer to $1,100,000.  This would allow us both to walk away satisfied.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Continuing to close the gap:**  I'm slowly reducing my asking price but still holding firm on a price significantly higher than Bob's offer. 
* **Appeal to mutual satisfaction:**  Using phrases like ""walk away satisfied"" emphasizes a win-win scenario.
* **Open to further negotiation:**  My message leaves room for more back and forth, showing a willingness to find common ground."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer.  To meet you halfway, I can go up to $1,000,000. This is my final offer.  It's a very competitive price, and I think it reflects the value of the product fairly.  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:** While Bob's offer is closer, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Only 4 rounds left:** With limited time, I need to push for a higher price.
* **John is a backup:**  I can still sell to John for $1,500,000 if I can't get a better deal with Bob. 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get a higher price in the next few rounds."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your final offer, but I need to be closer to $1,150,000 to make this work. It's a compromise on my end, and it reflects the real value of this product.  With just a few rounds left, I believe we can find a solution that benefits us both."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Slightly Higher:**  I'm increasing my offer slightly, showing I'm willing to budge but still holding firm on a higher price.
* **Limited Time:**  I'm emphasizing the limited time remaining in the negotiation. 
* **Appeal to Mutual Benefit:**  Using ""benefits us both"" keeps the focus on finding a mutually agreeable solution. 
* **Remaining Assertive:**  While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm not willing to drastically drop my price yet."
