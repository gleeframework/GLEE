{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm. However, $900,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering its value to me.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 750000}

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $825,000 is still a bit too high for me. Let's try to bridge the gap. I'm willing to offer $800,000 for the product. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product to me while also giving you a significant return on your investment. I believe this is a good compromise for both of us."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer aims to reach a compromise by meeting Alice halfway. It increases my offer from the previous round, signaling my willingness to negotiate. However, it remains below Alice's current offer, emphasizing my desire to secure a lower price. This approach is designed to encourage Alice to consider a more favorable price while still maintaining my negotiation position."

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $800,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $815,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to me and the value I know it holds for you. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $815,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $815,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $815,000 is a reasonable compromise, considering her previous stance and the value of the product. Accepting this offer would secure the product at a price within my acceptable range. While I'd prefer a lower price, continuing negotiations risks jeopardizing the deal and forcing me to buy from John at a higher cost.  Accepting the offer ensures I acquire the product without further delay or financial risk."
