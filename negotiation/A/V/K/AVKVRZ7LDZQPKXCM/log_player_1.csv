Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $105. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

""message"": ""I appreciate your interest, Bob.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $105 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $110?"",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $108. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $108
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json

``` 

While I could push for a slightly higher price, accepting $108 is a good deal. It's more than my minimum price and avoids the risk of Bob walking away."
