"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
The product is worth $1,500,000 to me. While $1,200,000 is a significant amount, it's still below my minimum threshold. I'll counter Bob's offer and see if we can reach a more favorable price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me.

Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 1400000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit short on budget. How about we meet in the middle at $1,300,000? This way, we can both feel comfortable with the price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000

While $1,300,000 is closer to my minimum threshold, it's still below what I'm comfortable with. I'll see if I can push for a slightly higher price in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I've been negotiating with Bob for a while, and we're not getting close to my desired price. At this point, it's better for me to sell the product to John, who is willing to pay my minimum price of $1,500,000."
