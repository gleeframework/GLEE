"Alice, thanks for the offer.  $1100000 is a good starting point, but I'm really hoping to get this product for closer to $950000.  I think that's a fair price for both of us, considering your value and my budget.  What do you think?",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand where you're coming from, Bob, but $950000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1050000. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
