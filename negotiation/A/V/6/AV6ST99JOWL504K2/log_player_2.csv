"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. I think it's a game-changer and I believe you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1100000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $1,100,000 is better than $1,200,000, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer.  $1,100,000 is a good starting point, but I'm really hoping to get this product for closer to $950,000.  I think that's a fair price for both of us, considering your value and my budget.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand where you're coming from, Bob, but $950000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1050000. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's price:** $1,050,000 is lower than $1,200,000, which is what Bob would pay to John. 
* **No guarantee of a lower price:** It's possible that Alice might not budge further, and Bob might end up paying more if he keeps rejecting offers.

By accepting Alice's offer, Bob saves $150,000 compared to buying from John. This is a good compromise considering the potential risk of getting a worse price by continuing negotiations."
