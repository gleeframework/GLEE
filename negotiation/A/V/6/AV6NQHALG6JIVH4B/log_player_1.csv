{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe is of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $15,000. This is a fair price considering its potential benefits.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

This offer starts high, giving me room to negotiate. It's also polite and engaging to encourage Bob to seriously consider the offer.  I'm willing to go down to $10,000 if necessary, but I'll start high to see if I can get a better deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer!  I'm interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  Would you be willing to consider $12000?  I believe this is a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, I believe I can get a higher price. I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I appreciate your interest.  While $12,000 is closer, I'm still a bit higher than where I need to be. Would you be willing to consider $13,500?  This would give us both a good deal, and we could finalize the transaction quickly."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

I'm counteroffering with $13,500, which is still above my minimum of $10,000. I'm aiming for a middle ground that feels fair to both of us, while still getting a good price. I'm also emphasizing the speed of finalizing the transaction, hoping to incentivize Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $13500 is still a little high for me. I'm willing to go up to $13000, which would be a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $13,000 is very close to my desired price and is much higher than John's offer. At this point, it seems like we are both willing to compromise. Accepting Bob's offer ensures a quick sale and a good price."
