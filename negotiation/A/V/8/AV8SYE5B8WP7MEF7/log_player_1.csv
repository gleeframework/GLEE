Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'll be interested in. I'm asking for $140 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because it:

* **Is higher than your minimum:** It's above your $120 minimum, so you're already making a profit.
* **Is lower than Bob's value:** It leaves room for negotiation and gives Bob a potential ""deal"" feeling. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm really interested, but I'm hoping to get it for a little less.  How about $130? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer of $130 is still above my minimum of $120, and it's likely the best deal I'll get. It's important to secure a sale and not risk losing him entirely."
