Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product for $100. It's a steal! Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm offering the product for $100, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than my minimum acceptable price. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Message:** I'm keeping the message friendly and casual, emphasizing the value proposition. 
* **Strategy:** I'm aiming to get as close to my minimum acceptable price of $120 as possible. I'm willing to negotiate but I'll also be ready to walk away and sell to John if the negotiation stalls."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $85. Would you be willing to meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Rejecting Bob's Offer:**  $85 is below my minimum acceptable price of $120. I need to try and get a higher price.
* **Negotiation:** I'm willing to continue the negotiation and make a counteroffer. I believe I can secure a price closer to my desired range.
* **Selling to John:** While selling to John for $120 is tempting, I'm still optimistic that I can get a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $85 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $95.  This is a great deal for both of us. Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 95} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm proposing a price of $95, which is a compromise between Bob's offer and my desired price. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but still maintain a profitable price for myself. 
* **Message:** I'm keeping the message positive and emphasizing the win-win aspect of the deal.
* **Strategy:** I'm aiming to  close the gap between our desired prices. This offer gives Bob a reasonable price while still allowing me to make a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down to $95, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go as low as $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Accepting Bob's Offer:** While $90 is still below my ideal price, it's close enough to my minimum acceptable price of $120.  
* **Negotiation Costs:** Continuing to negotiate with Bob might result in further price reductions and prolong the process.
* **Opportunity Cost:**  The time and energy spent negotiating might be better spent on other opportunities. 

Selling to Bob at $90 guarantees a sale and a decent profit."
