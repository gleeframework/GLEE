"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just getting started, I'd like to make an initial offer of $950,000. This is a great price considering the product's value to you, and I'm willing to be flexible to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product has value,  $950,000 is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $700,000.  I believe that's a fair price that reflects its worth to me.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer of $700,000. I appreciate your honesty, but I'm afraid that's a bit too low for me. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm proposing a counteroffer of $825,000. This is a fair price that takes into account your concerns while still reflecting the product's worth to me.",825000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  $825,000 is closer, but I'm still aiming for a price closer to my initial offer. Would you consider $750,000?  I'm hoping we can find a number that works for both of us.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns, and I'm willing to be flexible. However, $750,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to make another concession. I'm proposing a counteroffer of $800,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",800000.0,Alice,5,
