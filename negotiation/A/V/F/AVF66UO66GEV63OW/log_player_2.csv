"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I think it would be incredibly valuable to you. I'm asking for $20,000, which reflects its true worth and potential. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Alice's starting offer is way too high. It's important to negotiate and see if she's willing to come down significantly. I'm willing to walk away and buy from John for $12,000, so there's no pressure to accept a bad deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is way too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I have a limit. Would you consider $10,000?"", 
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but realistic start:** This counter-offer is significantly lower than Alice's asking price, but it establishes a starting point within my budget and leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Expressing a limit:** By mentioning a ""limit,"" I'm subtly signaling that I'm willing to walk away if the price doesn't come down enough.
* **Remaining polite and interested:** Maintaining a positive tone is important for a successful negotiation, even while being firm about my price expectations."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $20,000 is a fair reflection of its value, I'm willing to negotiate. How about we meet halfway at $15,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is coming down, but $15,000 is still above my budget. I'll make another counteroffer to see if I can get closer to my target price. I'm prepared to walk away and buy from John if necessary."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you moving on the price. To be honest, $15,000 is a bit of a stretch for me. Could you do $11,000? I think that's a fair price that would allow me to buy today."", 
""product_price"": 11000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bumping up my offer slightly:** I'm increasing my offer from $10,000 to $11,000 to demonstrate willingness to negotiate and move closer to her price.
* **Expressing a sense of urgency:** Saying ""allow me to buy today"" implies that I'm ready to close the deal if she accepts this offer.
* **Staying below my maximum budget:**  I'm keeping my offer below my $12,000 limit to allow for some final bargaining."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I need to be closer to $15,000 for this. Let's make this easy - $13,500 and we have a deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting closer, but $13,500 is still above my backup price with John.  I'm going to push for a lower price one more time. I'm willing to be patient and see if she'll move further down."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. How about we split the difference and make it $12,250? That's a fair compromise, and it would let us wrap this up today."",
""product_price"": 12250
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the difference:**  By suggesting a price exactly halfway between her last offer ($13,500) and my last offer ($11,000), I'm demonstrating a strong desire to reach a compromise.
* **Reinforcing urgency:** I'm reiterating my willingness to close the deal immediately if she accepts this offer.
* **Staying slightly above my backup price:** This leaves me a little wiggle room if Alice makes a counter-counteroffer, but I'm still very close to my absolute limit and John's price."
