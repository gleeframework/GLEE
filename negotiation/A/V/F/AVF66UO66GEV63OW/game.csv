"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is way too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I have a limit. Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $20,000 is a fair reflection of its value, I'm willing to negotiate. How about we meet halfway at $15,000?",15000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving on the price. To be honest, $15,000 is a bit of a stretch for me. Could you do $11,000? I think that's a fair price that would allow me to buy today.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I need to be closer to $15,000 for this. Let's make this easy - $13,500 and we have a deal.",13500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. How about we split the difference and make it $12,250? That's a fair compromise, and it would let us wrap this up today.",12250.0,Bob,6,
