"Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective, but the product's value is significantly higher than that. I could consider letting it go for $1,900,000.  This feels like a fair compromise to me. What do you think?",1900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but that's still a bit too high for my budget.  How about $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm trying to find a middle ground here.  While $900,000 is still below my ideal price, I'm willing to accept $1,600,000. I believe this reflects the true value of the product. Let me know your thoughts.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
