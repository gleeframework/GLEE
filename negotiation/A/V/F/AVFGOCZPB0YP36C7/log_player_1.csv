Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

Since I know Bob values the product at $1,000,000, I'm offering it to him for that exact price. This guarantees a sale and maximizes my profit.  While I could try to ask for more, there's no incentive for Bob to pay more than his perceived value, and I'd risk losing the sale and having to settle for John's offer."
