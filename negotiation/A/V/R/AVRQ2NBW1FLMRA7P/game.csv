"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1200000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm only making it available to you because I think you're the right person to appreciate its value. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your confidence in the product's value, but  $1200000 is slightly above my budget. I'm very interested in the product but would like to offer $1000000.  This reflects my current budget, and I believe it's a fair price for a product of this caliber.  Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product and I'm willing to consider your proposal. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1100000. This is a compromise that I think reflects the product's value, and I believe it's a fair price considering its unique features and benefits. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1100000 is still a bit higher than I can comfortably go.  I'm ready to make a final offer of $1050000.  This is my absolute limit, but it reflects my genuine interest in the product and the value I see in it. Let me know your thoughts.",1050000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your final offer, Bob. I understand that you've gone as low as you can, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $1050000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my original offer. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1080000. This is my final counteroffer. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm ready to make a deal.",1080000.0,Alice,5,
