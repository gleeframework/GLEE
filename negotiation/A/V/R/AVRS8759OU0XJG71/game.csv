"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think that's the most I can go.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $100 is just too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $115?  That's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think.",115.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $115 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so how about we go with $107.50? That's the highest I can go.",107.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good price, and I appreciate that.  However, $107.50 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle again?  I'm willing to go down to $112.50,  Let me know if you're interested.",112.5,Alice,5,

"I'm getting close, but I still think we can do better. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so how about we go with $110? That's the highest I can go.",110.0,Bob,6,
