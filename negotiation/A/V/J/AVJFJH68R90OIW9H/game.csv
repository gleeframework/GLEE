I have a great product that I think you'll really like. I'm willing to sell it to you for $150.,150.0,Alice,1,,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer,
That's a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $100?,100.0,Bob,2,,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer,130.0
"I understand you're looking for a good deal, but I think $100 is a bit low for this product. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $130.",130.0,Alice,3,,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer,
It's still a bit more than I was hoping to spend. How about $115?,115.0,Bob,4,,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer,125.0
"I can see you're still a bit hesitant, but I'm willing to compromise. I'll meet you at $125, but that's as low as I'm willing to go.",125.0,Alice,5,,
