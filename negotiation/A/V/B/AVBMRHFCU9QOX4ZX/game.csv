"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's worth at least $1,000,000 to me, and I know it's worth the same to you. To start, I'm offering it to you for $1,200,000.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us!",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to offer $800,000 for the product. I believe that's a fair price that reflects its value.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 is a bit too low for me. I understand you're looking for a good deal, but this product is truly valuable, and I'm confident it's worth more than that to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let's try $1,000,000. That's a fair price that reflects the value of the product, and it also gives you a significant saving compared to your initial assessment.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
