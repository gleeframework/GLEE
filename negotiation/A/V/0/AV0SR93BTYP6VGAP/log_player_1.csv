Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:** This gives him some room to negotiate without feeling pressured to accept a price he finds unfair.
* **It's below your minimum:** This leaves you room to negotiate downwards if Bob rejects the offer, but still secures a profit above your minimum.
* **It's a reasonable starting point:** A $100,000 difference is a reasonable negotiating margin.

**Important Note:**  This is just the first offer. You will need to adapt your strategy based on Bob's response. Be prepared to counteroffer, potentially even down to your minimum ($1,000,000) if you feel that's necessary to reach a deal. However, remember that you can always walk away and sell to John for your minimum if the negotiations stall."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $900,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $700,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $700,000 is significantly below your minimum price of $1,000,000. While it's tempting to accept his offer and avoid further negotiation, it would result in a substantial loss for you.

**Next Steps:**

You should counteroffer Bob with a price that is closer to your minimum but still leaves room for negotiation.  A counteroffer of $850,000 would be a reasonable starting point. This demonstrates your willingness to negotiate but also maintains your commitment to a profitable transaction."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. While I appreciate your interest, $700,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $850,000, which still allows for a reasonable profit margin for both of us.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 850000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Fair but firm:** $850,000 is a reasonable compromise,  significantly closer to your minimum than Bob's offer, while leaving room for further negotiation.
* **Shows willingness to negotiate:**  This counteroffer demonstrates that you're flexible and open to finding a solution that works for both parties.
* **Keeps the negotiation moving:** By offering a new price point, you're keeping the conversation going and pushing towards a potential deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me a bit.  $850,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something below $800,000.  Would you do $750,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $750,000 is closer to your minimum, it's still below the $800,000 mark. This indicates he's unwilling to budge significantly, and accepting this offer would still mean a significant loss for you.

**Next Steps:**

You should counteroffer Bob again, aiming for a price closer to $800,000. You could try offering $825,000. This demonstrates a willingness to negotiate further while still protecting your interests.

It's important to remember that you can always choose to sell to John for $1,000,000.  However, keep trying to reach a deal with Bob if possible, as it could yield a higher profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $750,000 is still too far below my minimum. How about we meet in the middle?  I'm willing to go down to $825,000.  This gives us both a good deal and allows the negotiation to move forward. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 825000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** This offer is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway between his last offer and your previous counteroffer.
* **Still profitable:** $825,000 is still well above your minimum, ensuring a decent profit.
* **Positive tone:** The message emphasizes a desire to find a solution that benefits both parties, fostering a more collaborative atmosphere.

**Remember:** You are getting closer to your minimum. If Bob rejects this offer, you might consider going down further, but don't forget you can always sell to John for $1,000,000."
