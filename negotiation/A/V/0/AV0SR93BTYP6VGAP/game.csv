"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $900,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. While I appreciate your interest, $700,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $850,000, which still allows for a reasonable profit margin for both of us.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me a bit.  $850,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something below $800,000.  Would you do $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $750,000 is still too far below my minimum. How about we meet in the middle?  I'm willing to go down to $825,000.  This gives us both a good deal and allows the negotiation to move forward. Let me know what you think.",825000.0,Alice,5,
