Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $11,999. I believe it will be highly beneficial to you, and this price reflects its true value."", 
""product_price"": 11999
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($10,000) as possible while still exceeding her minimum acceptable price ($12,000).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** While unlikely, starting high leaves room for Bob to counter-offer, potentially leading to a slightly higher sale price.
* **Guaranteed Sale:**  If Bob rejects the offer, Alice has John as a guaranteed buyer at her minimum price."
