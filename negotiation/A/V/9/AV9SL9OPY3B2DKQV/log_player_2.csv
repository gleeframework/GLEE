"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible.  While $115 is better than $120, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to save as much as possible, so starting with a counteroffer of $105 is a reasonable attempt. This is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer of $115, but still above her minimum of $100.  This leaves room for negotiation while also showing Bob is serious about buying the product."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming to save as much money as possible, and $110 is still higher than what he wants to pay.  There is room for more negotiation, and Bob should continue to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 108}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has already shown he's willing to negotiate.  His previous offer of $105 was rejected, but Alice has also moved closer to his target price by offering $110. This counteroffer of $108 shows continued commitment while being a reasonable compromise. It's likely Alice will accept, allowing Bob to save $12."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has not budged from her previous offer of $110.  While Bob could continue to counter-offer, the risk is that Alice may become stubborn and refuse to lower the price further.  Additionally, with only 5 rounds left, there is a chance that Bob will run out of time and have to buy from John at the higher price.  Accepting the $110 offer allows Bob to secure the product for a price that is still within his budget and saves him $10 compared to buying from John."
