"Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but $200 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",120.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your budget concerns, but $120 is too low for me. Could you do $160? That's a pretty significant price drop on my end.",160.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate the price drop to $160, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $140. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to make sure it fits within my means.",140.0,Bob,4,
