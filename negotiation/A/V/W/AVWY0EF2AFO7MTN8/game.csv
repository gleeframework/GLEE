"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $20000 is a bit higher than I was expecting. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $12000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's features and my budget.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. While $12000 is a bit lower than what I'm looking for, I'm willing to negotiate further. I'm open to selling the product for $17000. This price still reflects the unique value of the product, and allows for a fair compromise. Let me know if this works for you.",17000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thank you for the revised offer. While $17000 is still a bit higher than I was hoping to pay, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $14000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's features and my budget.",14000.0,Bob,4,
