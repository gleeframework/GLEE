{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you. My asking price is $175. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum because I have John as a backup buyer. I want to see if I can get closer to my target price before resorting to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $175 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay. I'd be interested in buying it for $125. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low for me. I'm going to reject it and try to negotiate a higher price. I'm not ready to sell to John yet, because I think I can still get a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $125 is just a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $150, which is still a great price for this product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 150}
