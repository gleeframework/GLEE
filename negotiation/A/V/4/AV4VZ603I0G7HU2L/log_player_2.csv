{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's not worth it to buy from Alice at $175 when you can get it from John for $150.  Let's see if we can negotiate a better price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 140}
```

I'm offering $140, which is a significant discount from her initial offer and still a decent price for me. Let's see if she's willing to budge."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $160
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer is still too high. I'm going to try and negotiate a lower price.  Let's see if we can get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 145}
```

I'm increasing my offer slightly to $145, which is still lower than Alice's last offer.  This shows I'm willing to compromise, but I'm hoping she'll come down a bit more."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $165. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $165

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's offer is still too high, and we're running out of time. It's better to buy from John at this point and guarantee I get the product for my target price."
