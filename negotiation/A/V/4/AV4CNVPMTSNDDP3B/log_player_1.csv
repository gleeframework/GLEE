Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $11,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $8,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'll reject Bob's offer.  $8,000 is too low for me. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I need to make at least a bit more than that."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $8,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $9,500?  This leaves room for both of us to be happy with the deal."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me a bit, but $9,500 is still a bit too high for my budget. Could you do $8,700?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,700
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'll reject Bob's offer again. While I'm getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not happy with $8,700. I'll counteroffer one more time before considering selling to John."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm starting to think we might not be able to agree on a price. I'm willing to make one final concession.  If you can meet me at $9,000, I'll sell you the product.  This is the absolute lowest I can go."", ""product_price"": 9000}
