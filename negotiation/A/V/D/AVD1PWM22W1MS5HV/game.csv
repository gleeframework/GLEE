"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested, $11,500 is a bit above my budget.  I'd be willing to pay $10,500 for the product.  What do you think?",10500.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob. However, I have to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $11,000 for the product. How about we try $11,000?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $11,000 is still a little high for me. How about we settle at $10,750?  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure we can reach an agreement.",10750.0,Bob,4,

"I can see you're really interested in this product, Bob. I'm willing to compromise a bit further, but I need to make sure I get a good deal. I'm thinking $11,250 is a fair price. What do you think?",11250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  However, $11,250 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Let's try $10,875. This is a reasonable price point for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",10875.0,Bob,6,

"I can see you're really close to making a decision, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $11,000, but I need to make a bit more than that to make it worth my while. How about we try $11,125? It's a small increase, but it's the minimum I can do to make it worth selling to you.",11125.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $11,125 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $11,000 for the product. This is a fair price that allows both of us to walk away with a win. What do you say?",11000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I've been flexible so far, Bob, but I need to think about my bottom line. I'm willing to meet you at $11,000, but I'm not going to go any lower. I'm going to throw in a small concession: I'll include a 1-year warranty on the product, which is worth $500. So, the total value you'll get is $11,500. I'm not budging any further.",11000.0,Alice,9,
