"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $2,000,000. This is a bold move, but I'm trying to gauge Bob's interest and see how high he's willing to go. I'm also leaving myself room to negotiate if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low. I'm going to reject it and try to get a better price. I'm confident I can get closer to my target price with some more negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $1,750,000. This is a significant compromise from my initial offer, but it's still above my minimum acceptable price. I'm hoping this shows Bob that I'm serious about selling, but I'm also not willing to undervalue the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low.  I'm going to reject it and see if I can get him to come up a bit more in the next round. I'm still confident I can get a better price than what John is offering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

I'm dropping my price a bit more to $1,600,000. I'm starting to feel the pressure of the limited rounds, but I'm still hoping to get a better price than John's offer. I'm trying to find a sweet spot where I can secure a sale without sacrificing too much."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is getting lower and lower, and I'm running out of rounds.  I'm starting to feel the pressure.  I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,500,000.  It's not the price I was hoping for, but it's better than accepting Bob's offer and potentially ending up with nothing."
