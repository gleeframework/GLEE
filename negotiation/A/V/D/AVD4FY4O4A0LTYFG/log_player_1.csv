Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,450,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Given the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $1,350,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000.

Bob's offer is lower than my minimum acceptable price, but it's still within the range where further negotiation is worth pursuing.  I'll counteroffer and try to get a price closer to my desired amount."
