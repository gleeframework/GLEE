"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item at a competitive price. I'm willing to offer it to you for $14,000. Is this something you'd like to consider?",14000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $14,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm interested in this product, but I'm only willing to pay $10,500. This is my best offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $10,500 is a bit lower than what I'm looking for, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm counteroffering at $13,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and your initial offer of $10,500. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $13,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $11,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and our previous negotiations. Let's try to reach an agreement.",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $11,500, Bob. However, I'm still a bit far from my target. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm counteroffering at $12,750. This is my final offer in this range. What do you think?",12750.0,Alice,5,
