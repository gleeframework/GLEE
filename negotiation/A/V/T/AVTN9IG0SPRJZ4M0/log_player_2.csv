You should reject Alice's offer. You are willing to pay $10,000 at most, and Alice is asking for more. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

I'm offering Alice my maximum price of $10,000. This is my absolute limit, and if she doesn't accept, I'll go with John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

Alice is still asking for more than I'm willing to pay.  At this point, it's better to cut my losses and buy from John for $10,000.  I've already rejected Alice's initial offer and countered with my maximum, so further negotiations are unlikely to result in a price I'm comfortable with."
