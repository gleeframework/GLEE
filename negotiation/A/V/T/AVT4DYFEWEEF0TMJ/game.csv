"I appreciate your confidence in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8500. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While $8500 is a good offer, I need to stay closer to my asking price. How about we split the difference at $9250? This would be a fair compromise for both of us, allowing you to get a great product at a price you can manage and me to get a fair return on my investment.",9250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9250 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $8000 and $9250, which would be $8625. Can you consider that?",8625.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, and I appreciate your continued interest. While I'm willing to be flexible, $8625 doesn't quite meet my needs. Let's aim for a final compromise. I'm prepared to lower my price to $9000. This is a significant move from my previous offer, and it shows my commitment to finding a solution that benefits both of us. Let me know if you're willing to accept this final offer.",9000.0,Alice,5,
