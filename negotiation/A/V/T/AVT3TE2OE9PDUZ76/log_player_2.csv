"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for $120. It's a fantastic deal, and I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Let's try to get a better price from Alice before resorting to John.  Alice's starting price is quite a bit higher than our ideal budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Thanks for showing me the product, Alice! $120 is a bit steep for me though. Would you consider $60?"",
 ""product_price"": 60
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** We're aiming to pay significantly less than Alice's asking price.  Starting with a low counteroffer of $60 leaves room for negotiation.
* **Polite and Positive:** Maintaining a friendly tone is important for successful negotiation. We acknowledge Alice's offer while clearly stating our price limit. 
* **Testing the Waters:** This counteroffer will give us insight into how flexible Alice is willing to be with her price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I'm afraid $60 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. How about we try $90? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice meeting us halfway is a good sign that there's room for negotiation.  However, $90 is still above our ideal price and our maximum budget. We'll try to nudge the price closer to $80."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me on the price, Alice.  How about we settle at $75?"",
 ""product_price"": 75
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference (Almost):** This counteroffer meets Alice a little closer to the middle ground between her last offer ($90) and our previous counteroffer ($60). 
* **Staying Firm (But Fair):**  We're signaling that we're serious about buying but not willing to go over our budget significantly. 
* **Leaving Room for One More Round:** This leaves a little wiggle room if Alice comes back with a price slightly above $75. We can then decide if it's worth paying a bit more or going with John's offer of $80."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm getting close to your offer, but I'm still not comfortable with $75. I'm willing to compromise a bit more. How about we try $85? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to work with us, and $85 is only $5 over our ideal budget. It's unlikely she'll go much lower, and we risk losing the deal entirely if we push further. It's a good compromise to get the product while staying within a reasonable price range."
