Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I agree the product is valuable, $18,000 is too high for me. I'm interested, but only if we can find a price that works for both of us.  Would you consider $10,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
