"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item at a competitive price. I'm willing to offer it to you for $18,000.",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I agree the product is valuable, $18,000 is too high for me. I'm interested, but only if we can find a price that works for both of us.  Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $10,000 is a significant discount, but I'm not willing to go that low. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer you a price of $14,000. It's a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value, and I believe it's a good opportunity for you to acquire it.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for coming down on the price. I appreciate the effort to find a compromise. To be honest, $14,000 is a bit of a stretch for my budget.  Would you be willing to consider $11,000? That's the highest I can go.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $11,000 is a tough ask for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make another compromise. I'll offer you a price of $13,500. It's still a discount from my original price, but it's closer to what I'm willing to accept.",13500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. However, $13,500 is still more than I'm comfortable spending. To be completely transparent, I've found a similar product elsewhere for $12,000. I'd prefer to do business with you, but only if you can match that price.",12000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that you've found a similar product elsewhere for $12,000, Bob. However, I'm not willing to match that price. I've already discounted the product significantly, and I'm not willing to sacrifice my profit margins further. I'll offer you a price of $13,000. It's a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value, and I believe it's a good opportunity for you to acquire it.",13000.0,Alice,7,
