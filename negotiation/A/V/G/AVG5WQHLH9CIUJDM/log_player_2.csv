Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While $1400000 is a good starting point, I'm still hoping to get closer to my asking price.  I'm willing to come down to $1600000.  This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price given the product's value.

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's lower than her initial offer, it's still above his ideal price point and he can likely negotiate a lower price. He should try to make another counteroffer."
