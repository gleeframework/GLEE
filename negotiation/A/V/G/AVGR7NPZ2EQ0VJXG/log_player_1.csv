Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's significantly higher than my minimum, but still lower than the product's worth to Bob. This leaves room for negotiation and gives Bob incentive to work with me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a little too high for my budget. Would you consider $10,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $10,000 is a good price, it's still below my desired profit margin. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and I'm willing to negotiate. However, $10,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $11,000?  It's a fair price for both of us, and we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 11000}
