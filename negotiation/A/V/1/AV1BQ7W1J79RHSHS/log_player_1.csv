Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 150}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $150. It's a good starting point, allowing for some negotiation room while still ensuring I get a profit. If Bob rejects, I'll consider his counteroffer and try to reach a mutually agreeable price.  I'm also keeping John in mind, so if the negotiation with Bob doesn't go well, I have a fallback option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While I'm happy to sell the product for $100, it's not a great deal for me.  I'd rather see if I can get a better price from Bob. I'll counteroffer him with a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 125}
```

I'm willing to lower my price to $125. This is still a decent profit for me, and it shows Bob that I'm open to negotiation.  I'm hoping this counteroffer will be more appealing to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is unwilling to budge on his price.  While I would prefer to get more, I'm not willing to risk further negotiation and potentially end up with nothing. John's offer guarantees me $100, which is my minimum acceptable price. I'll sell the product to John."
