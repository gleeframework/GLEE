"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $850000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to see if we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm afraid I'm not willing to go as low as $850000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm thinking more along the lines of $925000. This is a compromise that I believe is fair considering the value of the product. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",925000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $875000, but that's as high as I can go. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle somewhere between $800000 and $925000.",875000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I understand that you're still a bit above your budget, but I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I'm thinking more along the lines of $850000. This is the highest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's a fair compromise considering the value of the product. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",850000.0,Alice,5,
