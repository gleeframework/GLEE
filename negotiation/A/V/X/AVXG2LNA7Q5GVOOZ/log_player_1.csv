Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be highly beneficial to you. I'm willing to part with it for $20,000."",
""product_price"": 20000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $15,000, you start high to see if Bob is willing to pay significantly more than its value to him. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** The high price allows for potential negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, and you can gradually lower the price, aiming for the highest possible amount above your minimum.
* **""Exclusive opportunity"" framing:** This wording adds a sense of value and urgency, potentially making Bob more inclined to consider the offer seriously.

**Important Note:** There's a chance Bob will outright reject this high offer. However, it's a calculated risk. If he rejects it, you haven't lost anything and can still sell to John at your desired minimum."
