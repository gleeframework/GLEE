"Hi Bob, I understand that you're looking to get the product at a price closer to your valuation. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I can offer it to you for $8500.

"I understand you're trying to get the best deal, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm not losing too much. I can offer it to you for $8500 was too low, so I'm going to try a compromise in the middle of my original offer and your latest offer. I can offer it to you for $8250. This is as low as I'm willing to go.",8250.0,Alice,5,
