"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this truly unique product.  Given its immense value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a starting price of $1,800,000. What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 1800000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm aiming high initially to establish a strong anchoring point. This leaves room for negotiation while signaling the product's significant value.
* **Confident Tone:** The language is positive and emphasizes the product's exclusivity and potential, aiming to influence Bob's perception. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** By asking for Bob's thoughts, I invite him into the conversation and make it clear I'm open to discussing the price.

My strategy is to start high and gradually decrease the price, but always stay above John's offer ($1,000,000). I'll carefully analyze Bob's counteroffers to gauge his willingness to pay and adjust my approach accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,800,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,400,000 is substantial, I believe there's still room for negotiation. His willingness to engage and counter so significantly suggests he sees considerable value in the product. I'm confident I can secure a better price by strategically countering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand your perspective.  This product truly is one-of-a-kind, and its value is reflected in my counteroffer of $1,650,000. I believe this price point represents a fair deal considering the unique benefits it offers.  What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 1650000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:**  I've lowered my price by $150,000, demonstrating willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a significantly higher figure than Bob's offer.
* **Value Emphasis:**  I'm reiterating the product's unique value to justify the higher price point and keep Bob focused on its benefits.
* **Seeking Common Ground:** By asking for Bob's thoughts again, I'm encouraging further dialogue and aiming for a mutually agreeable solution.

My strategy remains to steadily approach a favorable price while maintaining a firm stance on the product's worth. I'm aiming to close the deal with Bob above $1,500,000, but I'm prepared to adjust my approach based on his responses."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your revised offer, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,550,000. Can you consider this compromise? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,550,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,550,000 is a strong compromise and meets my target of exceeding $1,500,000. While I might be able to push for slightly more in subsequent rounds, there's also a risk that Bob could lower his offer or walk away. Accepting now secures a substantial profit and avoids the uncertainty of prolonged negotiations."
