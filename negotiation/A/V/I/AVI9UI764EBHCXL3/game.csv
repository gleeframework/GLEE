"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $650,000 is too low. I'm willing to come down to $850,000.  This is still a great deal for you, considering the value of the product. Let's try to find a mutually agreeable price.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $720,000 is still a bit low, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll accept $780,000 for the product. This is a good price for both of us, and it allows us to close the deal.",780000.0,Alice,5,
