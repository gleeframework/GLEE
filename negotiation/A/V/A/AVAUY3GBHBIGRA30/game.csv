"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate the discount, but I'm hoping to get a better price.  I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product. This is still a fair price considering its value to me, and it allows both of us to make a good deal.  Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and respect your valuation of the product. In light of this, I am prepared to consider a price closer to your offer. Therefore, I am now offering the product at $10,750. This is a price higher than your counteroffer but still below the original asking price. I hope this proposal is more acceptable and allows us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",10750.0,Alice,3,
