Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate it, but I was hoping to keep the price closer to my valuation of the product. Would you consider selling it to me for $10000?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

I'll reject Bob's offer and try to get a better price.  While I'm willing to sell for $10,000, there's room for negotiation.  I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer."

While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, Bob's offer of $10,500 is still a good deal.  It's more than what John is offering, and it's getting closer to my minimum acceptable price. I'll accept his offer."
