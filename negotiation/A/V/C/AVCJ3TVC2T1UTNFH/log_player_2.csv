"Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is above your maximum value:** You're willing to pay a maximum of $1,000,000, and Alice's offer is $950,000.
* **There's room for negotiation:**  Alice's offer is also above her minimum value ($800,000), which means there's room for negotiation. 
* **John's offer is a backup:** You can always buy from John for $1,000,000 if negotiation with Alice fails.

**Strategy:** Rejecting Alice's offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive yet reasonable:** This counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's offer ($950,000), but it's still above her minimum value ($800,000).  This shows you're serious about negotiating while also leaving some room for compromise.
* **Mid-point strategy:**  This offer sits in the middle of your maximum ($1,000,000) and Alice's minimum ($800,000), making it a strong starting point for further negotiation.

**Strategy:** 
By proposing a significantly lower price, you're pushing for a better deal while still acknowledging Alice's needs.  The counteroffer gives Alice an incentive to accept but also leaves space for further negotiation if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high:** While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above your maximum value of $1,000,000. 
* **More room for negotiation:** Alice is still willing to negotiate, suggesting there's still room to get a price you're comfortable with.
* **John's offer is still a safe backup:**  If you can't reach an agreement with Alice, you can always purchase from John for $1,000,000.

**Strategy:** 
Rejecting Alice's offer allows you to continue negotiating and attempt to get a price closer to your ideal range. By continuing to negotiate, you might be able to get a better deal than John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise and closing the gap:** This counteroffer is a compromise, falling between your previous offer ($850,000) and Alice's latest offer ($975,000). It shows your willingness to meet halfway. 
* **Pushing towards your limit:**  This offer is still within your maximum budget of $1,000,000, but it's closer to your desired price.
* **Increased pressure:**  By raising your offer, you're putting some pressure on Alice to accept, as it's more likely to be closer to her acceptable range.

**Strategy:** 
This counteroffer aims to create a sense of urgency and encourage Alice to accept. It is a reasonable price for both parties, and hopefully, it will lead to a successful deal.  If she rejects, you can always fall back on John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $985,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $985,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too close to your maximum:**  Alice's price ($985,000) is only $15,000 below your maximum, leaving very little room for further negotiation.
* **Limited potential savings:** Even if you continue negotiating, the potential savings are minimal.
* **Risk of further delays:**  More rounds of negotiation could take more time and energy, and there's no guarantee you'll get a significantly better price.
* **John's offer is reliable:** John is a sure bet, providing a predictable price and a quick transaction.

**Strategy:** 
The potential for a better price is not worth the risk of further delays and possible negotiation failures. It's more efficient and less risky to buy from John, even though it's slightly above your desired price."
