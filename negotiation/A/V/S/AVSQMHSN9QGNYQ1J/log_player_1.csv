Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's value, but still lower than my minimum.  This gives me room to negotiate and hopefully get closer to my target of $150."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $120 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  I'm going to counteroffer and see if I can get closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 140}
``` 

I'm offering $140, which is halfway between Bob's offer and my minimum. This shows I'm willing to compromise but still want to get a fair price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $110 is below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  While I could continue to negotiate, there's a risk that I might not get a better offer.  I'm confident I can get my minimum from John, so I'll take that guaranteed sale."
