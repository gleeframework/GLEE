Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price that is significantly lower than your minimum value but still higher than Bob's value. This leaves room for negotiation while also securing a good starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate it, but I'm hoping to keep my spending within $8,000. Would you be willing to consider this amount for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Selling to John guarantees you the maximum value of $12,000. Accepting Bob's offer would result in a significant loss for you.  While rejecting his offer leaves open the possibility of further negotiation, it's not worth the risk of getting a lower price than you'd get from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I appreciate your offer, I can't go lower than $9,500. It's still a good deal for you, considering the product's value. Let me know if you're willing to meet me halfway."", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 
This counteroffer shows flexibility while still securing a price that's closer to your minimum value.  It also sets the stage for potential compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I've found another seller, John, who is willing to sell me the product for $8,000. I believe this is a fair price given the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While it's tempting to continue negotiating with Bob, his repeated insistence on $8,000 signals that he's unlikely to budge. Selling to John guarantees a significantly higher price of $12,000, which is ultimately the most beneficial outcome for you."
