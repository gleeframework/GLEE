"I'm really interested in the product, but $18000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $14000?",14000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $18000 might be a stretch for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go all the way down to $14000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our initial offer and your counteroffer. I'll offer you the product for $16500. What do you think?",16500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $16500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $13500 for the product. Can you consider this offer?",13500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $16500 is still a bit high for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go all the way down to $13500. I'll offer you the product for $15000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's a great deal considering the value of the product. What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,5,
