,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $600,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective on the pricing.  However, I believe $600,000 undervalues the product significantly. Let's meet in the middle â€“ how about $900,000?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $900,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to move towards a middle ground. To make this deal happen, I'm willing to come down slightly. Let's settle at $850,000.",850000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $850,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $750,000, which is the lowest I'm willing to go. Can you meet me at this price?",750000.0,Bob,6,
