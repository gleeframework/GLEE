"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $15,000 is a bit out of my price range.  I'm very interested in this product, and I'm willing to pay up to $10,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $15,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm still willing to negotiate. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering it to you for $13,000. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's worth to you.",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $13,000 is closer to my budget, I'm still not able to go that high.  My final offer is $11,000. If you're willing to accept that, we can finalize the deal. Otherwise, I'll have to move on.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal possible, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $11,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, and I'm offering the product to you for $12,500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",12500.0,Alice,5,
