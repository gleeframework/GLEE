"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $15,000. This is a competitive price considering its value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $15,000 is above your maximum budget of $10,000.  It's better to reject and counteroffer to try and negotiate a lower price."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $15,000 is a bit out of my price range.  I'm very interested in this product, and I'm willing to pay up to $10,000 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $15,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm still willing to negotiate. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering it to you for $13,000. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $13,000 is lower than her previous offer, it's still higher than my budget. I'm going to reject and try to negotiate a lower price again."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $13,000 is closer to my budget, I'm still not able to go that high.  My final offer is $11,000. If you're willing to accept that, we can finalize the deal. Otherwise, I'll have to move on."", ""product_price"": 11000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal possible, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $11,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, and I'm offering the product to you for $12,500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $12,500 is still above my budget of $10,000. While I could continue to negotiate, it's likely that Alice won't go lower.  At this point, it's more efficient to buy the product from John for $10,000.  I'm saving $2,500 compared to Alice's final offer, and I'm avoiding further negotiation rounds."
