"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product.  This is a fair price, considering the value you place on it. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to compromise too much on the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,075,000. This is a fair price, considering the value I place on the product and the value you've acknowledged it has for you.",1075000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. However, $1,075,000 is still a bit higher than I can comfortably go at this point. I'm confident that we can reach a mutually agreeable price. I'm prepared to offer $1,025,000 for the product. This reflects the value I place on it, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can close this deal.",1025000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I understand your desire to reach a mutually agreeable price, and I'm willing to make another concession. However, I'm not willing to drop the price by too much more. I'm willing to offer the product to you for $1,050,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's still a fair reflection of the product's value.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
