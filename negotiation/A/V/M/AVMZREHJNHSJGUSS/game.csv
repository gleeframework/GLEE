"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $2,300,000 is significantly above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,800,000 for this product, which is a fair price considering its value to me.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective.  While $2,300,000 represents a fair value in my eyes, I'm willing to come down to $2,100,000. I believe this price point acknowledges the product's worth while giving you a significant discount off my initial offer.",2100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $2,100,000 is still above my target.  I'm willing to go up to $1,900,000, which is a significant investment for me. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",1900000.0,Bob,4,
