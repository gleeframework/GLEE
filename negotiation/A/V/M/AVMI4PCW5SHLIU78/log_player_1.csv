"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer, knowing that Bob values the product at $15,000. This leaves room for negotiation, but still gives me a good starting point. I'm confident we can reach a mutually agreeable price within the 10 rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500}

I'm again lowering my price, but only slightly to $12,500. This demonstrates further flexibility while still staying above my minimum threshold.  I'm hoping this is a good enough compromise to convince Bob to accept the offer."

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm lowering my offer to $12,000. This is getting very close to Bob's last offer, and shows my willingness to compromise.  I'm hoping this final offer will be enough to secure the deal before we run out of rounds."

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

With only 2 rounds remaining, the chances of securing a higher price from Bob are slim.  It's better to take the guaranteed $10,000 from John than risk ending up with nothing."
