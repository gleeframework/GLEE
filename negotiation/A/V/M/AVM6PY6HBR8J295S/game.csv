"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for your business, potentially even more than my asking price. To kick things off, I'd like to propose a starting price of $1,100,000. What are your thoughts?",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the market value of the product.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. However,  $900,000 undervalues the true potential of this product.  I've done my research, and its capabilities align perfectly with your business needs. To move us closer to a deal, I'm willing to come down to $1,025,000. This reflects the product's significant value while acknowledging your perspective.",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1,025,000, but I'm still not convinced that's the right price. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I can only go up to $950,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the market conditions.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to find a middle ground. I understand your perspective on the market, but I'm also confident in the unique value this product offers. How about we split the difference and settle on $987,500? This feels like a fair compromise that recognizes the true worth of what we're discussing.",987500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $950,000. I'd like to propose a price of $925,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the market conditions, and it's the highest I'm willing to go.",925000.0,Bob,6,
