"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. I believe its value is significant, and I'm confident it will be a game-changer for your business. I'm starting with a price of $1,200,000, which reflects the product's potential.  Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  You're aiming to pay no more than $1,500,000, and Alice's starting point is already close to that.
* **Negotiation is possible.** Since Alice is willing to sell for $800,000, there's room for a significant price reduction. 
* **Rejecting gives you leverage.**  By rejecting the offer, you force Alice to come down in price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I see the potential in the product, $1,200,000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'm willing to offer $900,000, which is still a fair price given the product's value. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 900000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer is significantly lower:**  This puts pressure on Alice and shows you're serious about negotiating. 
* **Still above Alice's minimum:**  $900,000 is a good starting point for negotiation, leaving room for compromise.
* **Clear message:** The message explains your reasoning and expresses your willingness to find a deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your interest. While I value your business,  $900,000 doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $1,000,000. It's a fair price that allows us both to benefit from this deal. Let's meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still high.**  While it's come down, it's still above your target of $1,500,000.
* **More negotiation is possible.** You've shown you're willing to negotiate, and Alice is clearly flexible.  There's room to further reduce the price.
* **Rejecting maintains leverage.**  By rejecting, you continue to put pressure on Alice to lower her price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,000,000 is still a stretch for my budget. I'm willing to go up to $950,000, which represents a significant compromise from my previous offer.  Let's find a way to bridge the gap and make this deal work for both of us."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small increment:**  This shows you're serious about reaching an agreement but still pushing for a better price.
* **Reasonable compromise:** $950,000 is a fair middle ground between your last offer and Alice's current price.
* **Positive tone:**  The message maintains a respectful and collaborative tone, encouraging Alice to find a solution."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $950,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $975,000.  This is a fair compromise that acknowledges both our positions. Let's close this deal now. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is close to your target.**  $975,000 is well within your budget and allows you to save a significant amount compared to buying from John.
* **Further negotiation is unlikely to yield a significant improvement.**  While you could try to push for a lower price, the difference might not be worth the risk of losing the deal entirely.
* **Time is a factor.**  With only 5 rounds left, accepting now ensures you get the product at a good price and avoids the risk of running out of time."
