"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. I believe its value is significant, and I'm confident it will be a game-changer for your business. I'm starting with a price of $1,200,000, which reflects the product's potential.  Let me know your thoughts!",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I see the potential in the product, $1,200,000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'm willing to offer $900,000, which is still a fair price given the product's value. Let's see if we can find common ground.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your interest. While I value your business,  $900,000 doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $1,000,000. It's a fair price that allows us both to benefit from this deal. Let's meet in the middle.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,000,000 is still a stretch for my budget. I'm willing to go up to $950,000, which represents a significant compromise from my previous offer.  Let's find a way to bridge the gap and make this deal work for both of us.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $950,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $975,000.  This is a fair compromise that acknowledges both our positions. Let's close this deal now.",975000.0,Alice,5,
