"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I see the potential in the product, $1,200,000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'm willing to offer $900,000, which is still a fair price given the product's value. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your interest. While I value your business,  $900,000 doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $1,000,000. It's a fair price that allows us both to benefit from this deal. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,000,000 is still a stretch for my budget. I'm willing to go up to $950,000, which represents a significant compromise from my previous offer.  Let's find a way to bridge the gap and make this deal work for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $950,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $975,000.  This is a fair compromise that acknowledges both our positions. Let's close this deal now."", ""product_price"": 975000}
