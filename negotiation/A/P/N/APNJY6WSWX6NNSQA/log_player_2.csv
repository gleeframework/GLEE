"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product.  Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $15,000.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is far above your maximum budget of $10,000. It's worth exploring the negotiation process with Alice to see if you can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $15,000 is a bit outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial price, but it's still within your budget. This shows Alice that you're serious about buying the product, but you're also trying to get the best price possible."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $9,000 is significantly below its true value. How about we meet in the middle at $12,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's counteroffer is closer to your budget, it's still above your ideal price point. It's worth continuing the negotiation to see if you can get a better deal.  There are still several rounds remaining, and you can always buy from John if you don't reach an agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down.  $12,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm prepared to offer $10,500. This is my final offer before I look at other options."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Pushing the Limit:** You've raised your offer to $10,500, showing a willingness to compromise.  
* **Finality:**  The message emphasizes that this is your final offer. This adds pressure to Alice, potentially encouraging her to accept.
* **Alternative:**  Mentioning ""other options"" (buying from John) subtly reminds Alice that you're not desperate."
