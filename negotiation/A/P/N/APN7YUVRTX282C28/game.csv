"Thanks for the offer, Alice! However, $180 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps closer to $80?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $180 is a bit high for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $80. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $120. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product!",120.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me a bit closer, Alice. How about $95? That's a fair compromise, don't you think?",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm still not comfortable with $95, Bob. I think I can do better than that. I'm willing to offer the product for $110. It's a good compromise, and I think you'll be happy with the price.",110.0,Alice,5,
