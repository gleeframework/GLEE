"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than that. Let me know if we can come to an agreement.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still not able to go that low.  How about we split the difference and go with $11,000?  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it to be a good value. ",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above $11,000. How about we try $10,800? I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I really need to stay within my budget.",10800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $10,800 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $11,200.  This is a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price that allows both of us to walk away satisfied.  Let me know if you're able to accept this offer.",11200.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11,200 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so how about we try $10,900? I'm getting close to my budget, and I'd like to make a deal happen.",10900.0,Bob,6,

"Bob,  I'm running out of time, and I'd really like to make this deal work. I'm willing to go down to $11,100. This is my final offer, and it's the best I can do.  Let me know if you're able to accept.",11100.0,Alice,7,

"Hi Alice, I understand you're running out of time, but I'm still not comfortable with $11,100. I'm willing to make a serious offer, so how about we try $10,800 again? I'm really hoping we can come to an agreement.",10800.0,Bob,8,
