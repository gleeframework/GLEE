{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you this incredible product for $20,000. It's a steal considering its value. I believe it's a great deal for both of us. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 20000}
``` 

This offer starts at a price higher than your minimum, leaving room for negotiation.  The message is positive and encourages Bob to consider the deal.  

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $15000. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is your minimum, it's worth seeing if we can negotiate a higher price.  We'll counter with a price slightly higher than his offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $15,000 is my minimum, I'm willing to come down slightly to $17,000. This is a fair price considering the product's unique value and the opportunity it presents. Let's reach an agreement that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 17000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $17000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $16000. Can we discuss further? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $16,000 is a good compromise, and it's closer to our desired price than John's offer. It's worth accepting to avoid the risk of further negotiations and potential delays."
