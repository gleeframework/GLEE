# Alice's message: I'd like to offer you the opportunity to purchase this exclusive product at a special price. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $10,000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you'll find it a great value given its worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

``` 

Here's why:

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:**  Alice is offering the product for $10,000, which is lower than John's price of $12,000.
* **You still save money:** Even at $10,000, you are getting the product for less than your maximum budget of $12,000."
