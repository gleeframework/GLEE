Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm asking for $120 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 120}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** Offering $120 gives us room to negotiate down if necessary.
* **Appealing to Bob's value:** The offer is still significantly lower than the product's value to Bob, giving him an incentive to accept.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  A higher starting point allows for more flexibility in negotiating if Bob counteroffers.
* **Not risking too much:** We are still above our minimum acceptable price of $80, so we are not losing out if Bob rejects."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is close to our minimum:** $100 is only $20 below our minimum acceptable price of $80.
* **Risk of further negotiation:** If we reject Bob's offer, we risk him walking away or continuing to negotiate down, potentially leading to a lower price.
* **John's offer is a safety net:**  We can always sell to John for $80 if we reach an impasse with Bob.

It's better to secure a sale at a slightly lower price than risk losing Bob as a buyer and having to settle for John's lower offer."
