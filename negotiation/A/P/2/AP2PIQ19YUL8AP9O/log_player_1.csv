{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value and the interest I've already received, I'm proposing a price of $18,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 18000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** While you have a guaranteed sale at $15,000, aiming higher with Bob first allows you to potentially maximize your profit. 
* **Negotiation Room:**  Starting at $18,000 leaves room for Bob to negotiate down, potentially meeting somewhere closer to his $12,000 valuation while still exceeding your minimum. 
* **Scarcity Tactic:** Mentioning ""interest"" creates a sense of scarcity, subtly encouraging Bob to act quickly. 

**Important Note:**  This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob. If he completely rejects the $18,000, you can gradually lower the price, but never go below your $15,000 safety net (John's offer)."
