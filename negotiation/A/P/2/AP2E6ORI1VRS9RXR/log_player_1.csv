``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,500,000. This is a significant markup from my guaranteed minimum value of $1,200,000, giving me room for negotiation and a chance to maximize my profit. 

**Reasoning:**

* **Risk vs. Reward:** While there's a risk Bob might reject the offer, the potential reward of a higher sale price outweighs the risk of selling to John at the minimum value. 
* **Negotiation Space:** Starting with a higher price allows for some flexibility in negotiations if Bob counters. 
* **Bob's Value:** I have no information about Bob's perceived value of the product. This offer is a starting point to gauge his interest. 

Let's see what Bob's response is!"
