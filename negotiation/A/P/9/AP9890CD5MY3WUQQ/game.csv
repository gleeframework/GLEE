"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $2,000,000 is significantly higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product, which I believe is a fair price considering the value it holds for me.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,200,000 is too low for me to consider. This product offers significant value, and I believe a price of $1,800,000 reflects that value more accurately. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1800000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,800,000 is still a bit out of reach for me. I'm confident that this product will be a valuable asset to my operations, and I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for it. This offer reflects the value I see in the product, while remaining within my budget. Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
