Hello Bob! I'm selling a great product that I think you'd be interested in. I'm starting the price at $120. What do you think?,120.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit too high for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Can you meet me at that price?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. $90 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. How about $105? It's a fair price for a great product.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I was thinking more along the lines of $97.50. Can you consider that?",97.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal. While $97.50 is closer to my price, I'm still looking for a bit more. How about we meet at $102.50?  This would be a fair compromise and  a good value for the product.",102.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm still not convinced that $102.50 is the best price for me. I'm willing to meet you at $95, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. Can you consider that?",95.0,Bob,6,
