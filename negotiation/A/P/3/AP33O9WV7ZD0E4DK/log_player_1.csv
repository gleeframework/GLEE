Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $10,000. This is a good starting point, as it's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $8,000, leaving room for negotiation. I'm hoping to get as close to my ideal price as possible, but I'm also prepared to potentially negotiate lower if Bob is truly interested."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is better than selling to John, it's still lower than I'd like to receive. I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can push for a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

I'm offering $9,500, which is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. This shows Bob I'm willing to negotiate, but also that I believe the product is worth more than $8,500."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $9,200 is close enough to my desired price that I'm willing to accept it.  While I could continue negotiating, the potential gains are not worth the risk of Bob walking away entirely."
