"Alice, your offer is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $900000 for the product. It's a fair price, considering what I'm willing to pay, and it gives you a good profit. Let's see if we can make a deal.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1050000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $950000, which is a good compromise. This price would be a win-win for both of us. Let's see if we can finalize a deal.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $950000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1000000. This is a fair price for both of us and allows me to earn what I consider reasonable for the product. Let's close this deal.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
