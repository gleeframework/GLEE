{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $100. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to negotiate a bit. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. I'm aiming for a price closer to the value Bob places on the product ($120), but I'm also acknowledging my own minimum value ($80).  This strategy allows for potential negotiation while still leaving room for a fair deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. I'm really interested in the product, but I'm on a tight budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is my minimum, I want to see if I can negotiate a higher price. I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not able to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $90? This would still be a good deal for you, and it would allow me to get closer to what the product is worth to me."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're trying to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit short on budget. How about $85? I'm willing to pay a bit more, but I'd like to get as close to my budget as possible. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $85 is close to my minimum and a significant improvement from his previous offer.  I'm willing to accept it and move forward with the sale."
