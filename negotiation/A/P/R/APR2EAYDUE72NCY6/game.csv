"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints.  While $1,100,000 is below my minimum, I'm willing to come down slightly.  I'd be willing to accept $1,250,000.  This gives you a good deal, and allows me to make a fair profit.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
