"I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you're looking for a good deal. While $100 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $115.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",115.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $115, but I'm still a bit too high. Would you be willing to meet me at $108? That's the lowest I'm willing to go.",108.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $108 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference at $111? It's a fair price for both of us.",111.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not willing to go above $108. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so I'll make a new offer of $109. That's the best I can do.",109.0,Bob,6,
