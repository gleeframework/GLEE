"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this exceptional product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own a truly unique item. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and rarity.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product's uniqueness, $12000 is slightly out of my price range. I'd be willing to pay $9000 for it. What do you think?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12000 is a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $11000. It's still a great deal considering the product's value and rarity. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $11000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $9000.  I believe it's a fair price considering the potential for further negotiation. What do you say?",9000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that you're sticking to your original offer, but I'm willing to make another concession. I'm thinking of a price of $10500. It's still a great deal, and I'm willing to compromise to find a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate.  $10500 is getting closer, but I'm still hoping to get it for a bit less. I'm willing to go up to $10250. Let's find a way to make this work for both of us.",10250.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, and I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I'm thinking of a price of $10750. It's still a great deal, and I'm confident that you'll find the product valuable. What do you think?",10750.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your continued negotiation, but $10750 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending.  I'm going to stick with my offer of $10250. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the value of the product and our willingness to compromise. Let's close this deal!",10250.0,Bob,8,
