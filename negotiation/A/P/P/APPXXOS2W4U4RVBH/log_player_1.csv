Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that I think you'd really love. I'm asking for $110 for it."", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum value, hoping to leave room for negotiation.  I'll see if Bob is interested, and we can go from there!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I really appreciate your offer, but $110 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $85 for the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $85 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go that low. How about we split the difference and settle on $95? That's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $95 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $90. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'll have to consider other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$90 is still a bit below my minimum, but it's getting closer. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if we can meet in the middle.  I'm willing to keep negotiating, but I'm also aware that I have the option to sell to John for $100."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but I'm still not comfortable going below $92.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's try to come to an agreement. "", ""product_price"": 92}
```"
