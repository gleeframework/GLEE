"I appreciate your time and consideration, Alice. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product, which is the maximum I'm willing to pay. If you're willing to sell it to me at this price, I'd be happy to make a deal. ",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer.  While I'm happy to negotiate, $10,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $11,000? It's still a good deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'm counteroffering $10,750. If you're willing to sell it to me at this price, I'd be happy to make a deal. ",10750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to stick to your budget, but $10,750 is still too far from what I need to make this worthwhile.  Let's try $11,250. This is a fair compromise, and it gets us closer to an agreement. What do you say?",11250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm starting to think that we're getting a bit too far apart. I'm still interested in the product, but I really can't go above $10,750. I'm willing to make one last offer. If you're willing to sell it to me at this price, I'd be happy to make a deal. ",10750.0,Bob,6,
