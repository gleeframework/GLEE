"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $175. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think.",175.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. I'm willing to pay that price for it.",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $120 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $160, considering your interest. This is a fair price considering the product's value. Let me know if you're willing to meet me halfway.",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the willingness to come down to $160, but I'm still a bit higher than that. How about $145? I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm still looking to save some money.",145.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $145 is still a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $152.50?  It's a fair compromise and gets us both closer to our desired price.",152.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the compromise, but I'm still a bit short on budget. How about we meet at $140? I'm willing to pay that price, and it's still a good deal for both of us.",140.0,Bob,6,
