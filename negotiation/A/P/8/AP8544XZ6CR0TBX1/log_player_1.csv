Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. I'm willing to pay that price for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is too low. While it's tempting to accept, it's below my minimum value for the product. I'll try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest but $120 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $160, considering your interest. This is a fair price considering the product's value. Let me know if you're willing to meet me halfway."", ""product_price"": 160}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the willingness to come down to $160, but I'm still a bit higher than that. How about $145? I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm still looking to save some money. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $145

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $145 is still a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $152.50?  It's a fair compromise and gets us both closer to our desired price."", ""product_price"": 152.5}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the compromise, but I'm still a bit short on budget. How about we meet at $140? I'm willing to pay that price, and it's still a good deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

Bob's offer is still below my minimum price.  I've only got 4 rounds left and don't want to risk losing out on a guaranteed $150.  It's time to sell to John."
