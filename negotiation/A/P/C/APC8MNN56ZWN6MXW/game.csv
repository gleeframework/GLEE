"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have a budget constraint. Can you meet me at $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,2,,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer,
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraint, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $9,500. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really benefit from owning this product.",9500.0,Alice,3,,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer,8500.0
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $9,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I think $8,000 is a fair price. Can you consider meeting me at $8,500?",8500.0,Bob,4,,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer,
"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to pay a premium for the product. However, I'm not willing to go as high as $8,500. I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,200. It's a compromise, but I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",9200.0,Alice,5,,

"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $9,000. However, I'm still not willing to sell it to you at that price. I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,300. It's a small increase, but I think it's still a fair price for the value the product brings.",9300.0,Alice,7,,

"I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're not going to meet in the middle. I'm willing to go up to $9,200, but I really think $9,300 is a bit too high. Can you reconsider and meet me at $9,200?",9200.0,Bob,8,,
