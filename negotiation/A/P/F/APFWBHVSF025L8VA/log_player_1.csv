Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

I'm starting with a price that is 20% higher than Bob's perceived value of the product. This gives me some room to negotiate down if needed, while still aiming for a good profit.  I'm also aware that I can always fall back on John's offer of $1,000,000 if Bob rejects my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it is lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. I'm hoping to get a better deal by counter-offering, but I'm aware I can always sell to John for $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

I'm counter-offering with a price of $1,050,000. This is still a good profit for me and is closer to Bob's offer. I believe this price will encourage Bob to continue negotiating without risking a complete breakdown in negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $980,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer again, as it's still below my minimum acceptable price. However, I'm getting closer to the $1,000,000 mark. I'm going to counteroffer again to see if I can bridge the gap and secure a deal without having to sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

I'm offering the product for $1,000,000. This is my minimum acceptable price, and I believe Bob is getting closer to accepting it. At this point, I'm willing to sell to John for the same amount, so there's no real risk in sticking to this offer."
