Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Value:** Bob is willing to pay $12,000, so there's room for negotiation.
* **My Minimum:**  I need at least $10,000 to make the sale worthwhile. 
* **John's Offer:** John's offer of $10,000 is my safety net, ensuring I won't lose money.

By offering $11,500, I'm:

* **Maximizing Profit:** I'm aiming for a higher price than John's offer.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Bob still has $500 of potential value to gain by accepting.

This strategy balances my desire for a high price with the risk of Bob rejecting the offer."
