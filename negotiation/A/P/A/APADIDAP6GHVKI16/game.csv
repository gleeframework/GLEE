"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential, I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you. I'm initially proposing a price of $2,250,000. I believe this represents a fair starting point for our negotiation, considering the significant value this product holds.",2250000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,600,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price, considering my budget and the product's value.",1600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,600,000 is significantly below my valuation for this product. It represents a substantial investment on my end, and I need to ensure a fair return. How about we meet halfway at $1,925,000? This demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while still reflecting the true value of what's being offered.",1925000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet halfway, but I'm still not convinced that $1,925,000 is a good fit for me. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to be closer to my target. How about we try $1,700,000?",1700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm sensing we're getting closer to a deal that works for both of us. While $1,700,000 is still lower than I'd prefer, I'm willing to come down to $1,812,500. This is a significant concession on my part and reflects my desire to reach an agreement. What do you say?",1812500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1,812,500, but I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to be at $1,750,000 or lower. Can we try that?",1750000.0,Bob,6,
