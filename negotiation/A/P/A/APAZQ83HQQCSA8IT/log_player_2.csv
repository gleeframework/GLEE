**Reasoning:**

Alice has stated this is her final offer. While she might be bluffing, there's a considerable risk she won't go lower.  Even if she budges a little in subsequent rounds, it's unlikely she'll drop to a price that beats John's $1,000,000 offer. Taking John's deal guarantees the best price and avoids the risk of a stalemate with Alice."
