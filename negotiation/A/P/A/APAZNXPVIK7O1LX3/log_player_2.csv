"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this amazing product with you. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $11,500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $11,500 is a better price than John's $12,000, Bob can likely get a better deal by negotiating with Alice.  There's room for both of them to get a better outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer.  I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but $11,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $10,500 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $11,500 might be a bit steep, but I'm still very enthusiastic about the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $11,000 is still a better price than John's $12,000.  While Bob could continue to negotiate, the potential savings are getting smaller.  It's likely that Alice won't budge much further, and Bob might risk losing the product altogether if he keeps rejecting offers.  Accepting the offer secures the product at a reasonable price."
