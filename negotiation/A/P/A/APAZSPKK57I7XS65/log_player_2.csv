"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering this product for $14,000. I believe it offers significant value, and this price reflects its worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer is quite high. There's a lot of room for negotiation. It's in your best interest to counter-offer and see if you can get a significantly lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $14,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $10,000?"", 
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

This counter-offer aims to bring the price down significantly.  There's a good chance Alice will negotiate further, especially since her product is only worth $8,000 to her."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $10,000 is a bit too low for me to accept, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $12,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is coming down, but we're still a good bit away from a price that feels like a steal.  Let's counter-offer again and see if we can get closer to $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand you're not willing to go as low as $10,000 Alice, but $12,000 is still a bit more than I'd like to spend. How about we settle at $11,000?"", 
""product_price"": 11000
}
``` 

We're splitting the difference with this counter-offer. It shows we're willing to negotiate, but also that we're firm on getting a good price."
