"Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You can get the product for less from Alice.  Even though her initial offer is higher than your target, there's room for negotiation. Rejecting allows you to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering $100, which is still a good deal for Alice (as she values the product at $80) and significantly lower than her initial offer of $120. This is a reasonable starting point for negotiation, leaving space for potential compromise without going below my target price of $150."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price to $130, which is still within my budget and a better deal than buying from John for $150. Accepting this offer saves me money and allows me to secure the product.  While I could try to negotiate further, the risk of Alice walking away or a prolonged negotiation process is not worth the potential savings."
