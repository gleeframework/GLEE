"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a great deal, considering its true value to you is $800,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $600,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,000,000. This is still a great deal, considering its true value to you is $800,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1,000,000 is still too high for me. How about $700,000? This offer reflects my serious interest in the product while acknowledging the budget I have to work with."", ""product_price"": 700000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $1,000,000 is still a bit above your budget, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to compromise and offer the product to you for $900,000. This is still a great deal, considering its true value to you is $800,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go below your $800,000 limit. She's aware of the product's value to you and is trying to get as much profit as possible. It's better to secure the known deal with John than risk Alice not budging further."
