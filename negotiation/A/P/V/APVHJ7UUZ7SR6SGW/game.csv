"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $600,000.

"I understand that $1,000,000 is still a bit above your budget, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to compromise and offer the product to you for $900,000.
