"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price that's above my minimum but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Appealing to Bob's value:**  I'm highlighting the product's value to Bob, making the offer more appealing.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** This leaves room for Bob to counteroffer without feeling like he's being squeezed. 

**Strategy:**

My strategy is to start high and try to get as close to Bob's perceived value as possible. By leaving room for negotiation, I'm hoping to reach a compromise that's beneficial for both of us. I also have the option to switch to John if the negotiation with Bob doesn't yield a desirable outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, I'm not willing to settle just yet. I believe there's still room for negotiation, and I want to see if I can get closer to my ideal price.

**Strategy:**

I'm going to counteroffer in the next round. My goal is to slowly inch closer to Bob's perceived value, but I need to stay firm on my minimum acceptable price. I'll keep the option to sell to John as a backup in case the negotiation with Bob stalls."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a better price. While I appreciate your offer, I'm still looking for a bit more to make this deal worthwhile for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This reflects the value of the product and also allows for a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing a willingness to compromise by dropping my price.
* **Value and fairness:** I'm still emphasizing the product's value and framing my counteroffer as fair.
* **Room for negotiation:** This counteroffer leaves room for another round of negotiation.

**Strategy:**

My goal is to meet Bob halfway while still maximizing my profit. By offering $1,300,000, I'm hoping to find a middle ground that works for both of us.  I'm also keeping in mind the option to sell to John if the negotiation with Bob falls through."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,300,000. I'd like to propose a price of $1,150,000. This is the maximum I'm willing to pay for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  While it's tempting to sell at this point, I still believe I can get a better price.

**Strategy:**

I'll make a counteroffer in the next round. I'll try to meet Bob halfway again, but I won't go below $1,200,000. If Bob continues to refuse, I'll seriously consider selling to John, as my time is running out."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're sticking to your price, but $1,150,000 is simply too low for me. To make this deal work, I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000. This is a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it reflects the fair value of the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground here."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Sticking to my minimum:** I'm holding firm on my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000, but I'm offering a compromise to meet Bob halfway.
* **Emphasizing the value:** I'm continuing to highlight the value of the product to justify my asking price.
* **Framing it as a compromise:** I'm making it clear that I'm willing to make concessions to reach an agreement.

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer is my last attempt to reach a deal with Bob. If he rejects it, I'm likely to sell to John, as my time is running out, and I don't want to risk losing any more value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,250,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,150,000 and $1,250,000, so I'd like to propose a price of $1,200,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

This is a tricky situation. Bob's offer matches my minimum acceptable price, and I'm running out of time.  There's a risk that if I reject his offer and counter, he might walk away.  

**Strategy:**

I'm choosing to accept Bob's offer.  While it's not my ideal price, it's a decent outcome considering the limited time and the risk of losing the deal altogether. I'm also aware that selling to John would yield the same price, but I'm hoping to build a relationship with Bob for future potential deals."
