Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $20,000. I believe it offers significant value at this price."", ""product_price"": 20000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am only able to pay up to $15,000 for it. Would you consider meeting me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** Bob is unwilling to meet my minimum price. While I could counter-offer, there's no guarantee he'll go higher and I risk losing a guaranteed $15,000 from John. It's in my best interest to sell to John at my desired price."
