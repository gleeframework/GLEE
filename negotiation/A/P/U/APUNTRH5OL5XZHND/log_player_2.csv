"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for $9,500. This is an exceptional opportunity to acquire a valuable asset that is worth more than what you're willing to pay. Let's discuss how we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While Alice's offer is better than John's, it's still above Bob's maximum price point. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price with Alice."

{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value of the product, $9,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to counter your offer by suggesting a price of $9,000 for the product. This allows us to bridge the gap between our initial offers while still providing a fair profit for me. I look forward to your consideration of this proposal.

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming to get the product for as low as possible. While Alice's counteroffer is lower than her initial offer, it's still above Bob's desired price point. He can likely negotiate a lower price by rejecting and making another counteroffer."
