,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $110 is a bit above my budget. How about $95?  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",95.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $95 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $105. Let's meet in the middle and see if we can close this deal.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $105 is still a bit high for me. Let's split the difference and go with $100. This is my final offer, as I can get it elsewhere for the same price.",100.0,Bob,4,
