,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $110 is a bit too high for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $80, which is the price I was willing to pay from the start.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $80 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $95, which is still a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you say?",95.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $95 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $92.50?",92.5,Bob,4,
