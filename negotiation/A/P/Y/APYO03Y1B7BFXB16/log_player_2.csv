"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product at an introductory price of $750,000. This is a limited-time offer, so I encourage you to respond quickly to secure this exceptional deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice to see if you can get a lower price.  You're saving $50,000 by buying from Alice at that price, but there's still room for negotiation."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your prompt response, Bob. I understand your position and am willing to consider it. However, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $725,000 for the product. This still allows for a substantial profit for me while remaining competitive in the market. I hope we can come to an agreement that satisfies both parties.

Alice's counteroffer of $725,000 is a good deal.  You're still saving $75,000 compared to buying from John, and it's likely you won't get a lower price from Alice."
