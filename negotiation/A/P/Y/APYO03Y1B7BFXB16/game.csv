"Alice, while I appreciate the offer, $750,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $700,000 for the product. This is a fair price for both of us and ensures a quick and smooth transaction. Let's get this deal done.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your prompt response, Bob. I understand your position and am willing to consider it. However, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $725,000 for the product. This still allows for a substantial profit for me while remaining competitive in the market. I hope we can come to an agreement that satisfies both parties.",725000.0,Alice,3,
