"I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $80 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $90?  That's a fair price for both of us.",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit hesitant about $90. How about we meet at $85? That's the highest I'm willing to go.",85.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $85 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's try to find a compromise.  I'm willing to go down to $95.  That's a fair price that allows me to make a profit and hopefully still meets your needs.",95.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $95 is still a bit out of my budget. How about we meet at $87.50? That's the closest I can get to my target price.",87.5,Bob,6,
