Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your honesty about your budget targets.  I've tried to be flexible, but to be transparent, $900,000 is simply too low for me to consider.

This offer stands for the remainder of today's negotiations only, as I do have other potential buyers to consider.
