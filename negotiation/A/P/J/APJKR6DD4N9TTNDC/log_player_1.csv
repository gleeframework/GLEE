"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this exceptional product.  Given its unique value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,600,000 is fair.  What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 1600000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally advisable to start negotiations with a price higher than your desired outcome. This allows room for negotiation and creates the perception that you're willing to compromise.
* **Anchoring:** By starting at $1,600,000, you ""anchor"" the negotiation around a higher value, potentially influencing Bob's counteroffer.
* **Justification:** Highlighting the ""unique value and potential"" of the product provides a rationale for the high initial price.

This approach aims to maximize your potential gain while gauging Bob's interest and flexibility."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. However, your starting price is significantly higher than my budget. I'd be willing to consider purchasing the product for $800,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $800,000 is significantly below both your minimum acceptable price ($1,200,000) and his own perceived value ($1,000,000). This suggests there's room for negotiation. 

While selling to John guarantees your minimum, it's too early to concede. There's a good chance you can negotiate a better price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  I understand your perspective, however, $800,000 significantly undervalues the true worth of this product.  To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000. This reflects my commitment to finding a fair deal for both of us."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Conciliatory but Firm:**  Acknowledging Bob's counteroffer while standing firm that his initial price significantly undervalues the product.
* **Strategic Concession:**  A $200,000 decrease from your initial offer shows movement but remains within a range that meets your minimum requirement.
* **Justification:** Reiterate the value proposition subtly to reinforce that you're making a genuine effort to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 

This counteroffer aims to keep the negotiation moving while signaling that you're serious about securing a fair price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. However,  $1,400,000 is still too high for my budget. To be frank, I'm targeting a price closer to $900,000. Would you be open to a deal in that range? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is moving closer to his perceived value ($1,000,000) but is still significantly below your minimum.  Continuing the negotiation is the best strategy. You have leverage knowing John offers a guaranteed sale, giving you room to push Bob a bit further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your honesty about your budget targets.  I've tried to be flexible, but to be transparent, $900,000 is simply too low for me to consider. I'm willing to make one more significant move to close this deal today.  If you're able to meet me at $1,250,000, we have an agreement. This offer stands for the remainder of today's negotiations only, as I do have other potential buyers to consider."",
""product_price"": 1250000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:**  You're clearly stating your bottom line while leaving the door open for Bob to accept.
* **Time Constraint:**  Introducing a sense of urgency can prompt a decision. 
* **Alternative Options:**  Subtly reminding Bob of your alternative (John) reinforces your position and potential opportunity cost for him.

This counteroffer aims to secure a price close to your minimum acceptable value while giving Bob a final chance before you explore other options."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your willingness to negotiate. While $1,250,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a significant investment for me.  Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $1,100,000? This would allow me to make the purchase while acknowledging the value of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is a good compromise. Here's why:

* **Above Minimum:** It exceeds your absolute minimum price of $1,200,000, ensuring a profit.
* **Strong Position:** While you could potentially push for a slightly higher price, there's a risk Bob might walk away.  
* **Time Value:**  Continuing negotiations carries opportunity cost. Accepting now secures a good deal and allows you to allocate your time and resources elsewhere. 

While not the absolute highest you could have gotten, accepting $1,100,000 represents a successful negotiation outcome."
