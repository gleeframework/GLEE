"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1500000} 

This is a high starting point, but it allows for negotiation room. It's important to start high to see if Bob is truly interested and to maximize potential earnings. I'm also aware of the $1,000,000 fallback option with John, so I'm not afraid to walk away if Bob is not willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $1,000,000 is the minimum I'm willing to accept, I believe I can still negotiate a better price. I have 9 rounds left, and there's still a chance Bob will increase his offer. I'm not ready to settle for the minimum just yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000} 
```

I'm lowering the price slightly from my initial offer, but still aiming for a profit. This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate, but also signals that I'm not desperate to sell at Bob's low initial offer. I'm confident that I can reach a compromise that benefits us both."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob has increased his offer and we're getting closer to a compromise.  With only 6 rounds remaining, it's becoming riskier to hold out for more, especially considering John's offer of $1,000,000. It's a good deal and I'm confident I've maximized my profit given the circumstances."
