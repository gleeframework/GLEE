"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which I believe would greatly benefit you. Given its value to you, I propose a price of $140 for it. This offer is exclusive to you and represents a great opportunity to secure this item at a price slightly above its cost to me but below its perceived value to you. I look forward to your consideration. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140

Here's why:

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:**  Alice is offering the product for $140, which is less than John's price of $150.
* **You still save money:** Even though you're paying more than the product's worth to Alice ($120), you're still saving $10 compared to buying from John."
