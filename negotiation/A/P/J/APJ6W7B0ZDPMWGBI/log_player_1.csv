{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and think you'd really enjoy it.  I'm offering it to you for $100.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This is a starting point.  I'm offering the product for a price that's a bit above Bob's perceived value, but still below my minimum. This leaves room for negotiation while also maximizing my potential profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I really appreciate it, but $100 is a bit outside my budget. I'd be happy to pay $85 for it.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $85 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $120.  I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $85 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $95. That's a fair price for both of us.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  However, $95 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go to $90.  That's my final offer. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $90 is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below my target price. I'm not quite ready to accept yet.  I'll see if I can squeeze out a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $90 is still a little too low.  How about we split the difference and go with $92.50?  It's a fair compromise, and I think it's a price we can both be happy with.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 92.5}
