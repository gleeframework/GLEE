Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1000000} 

I'm starting high, at $1,000,000. This gives me room to negotiate if Bob makes a counteroffer. However, I'm keeping in mind John's offer of $800,000 as my absolute minimum.  Let's see what Bob says!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, I'm not desperate to sell. I'd like to see if I can get closer to my initial asking price.  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm going to counter with $900,000. This is a compromise, but it still leaves some room for negotiation if Bob wants to bargain further. I'm hopeful he'll see the value of the product and meet me somewhere in the middle."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price.  While I'd prefer to sell to Bob, I'm not willing to go any lower than my floor. John's offer of $800,000 is a secure option that meets my minimum, so I'll choose to sell to him."
