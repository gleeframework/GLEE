"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This price still allows me to make a reasonable profit while giving you a significant discount.  Consider this my final offer before I explore other options.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
