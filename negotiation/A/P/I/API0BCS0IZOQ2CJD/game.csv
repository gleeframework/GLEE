"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate the willingness to negotiate.  While I see the value in the product, $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'd be willing to pay $850,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $900,000 might be a stretch for you, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $875,000. This is a fair price considering the value it will bring to your business. What do you think?",875000.0,Alice,3,
