Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high price of $1,000,000. This is a bold opening offer, aiming to get a good starting point in the negotiation. I'm confident in the value of the product and want to maximize my earnings.  It's likely Bob will counter, which will give us a chance to find a middle ground. If he rejects, I'm prepared to engage in a back-and-forth to see if we can come to an agreement. 

However, I'm also aware that I can always walk away and sell to John for $800,000, giving me a solid fallback option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my desired price. While $700,000 is better than selling to John, I believe there's still room for negotiation to achieve a more favorable price. 

I will reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm counteroffering with $900,000. This is a compromise that shows I'm willing to negotiate but still maintain a price closer to my initial value. It's a significant step closer to Bob's offer, but I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's worth. 

I'm hoping this counteroffer will be more appealing to Bob and lead to a successful negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $800,000 is now equal to what I can get from John. There's no point in continuing to negotiate, as I'm not likely to get a better price from Bob. I'll accept his offer and secure the sale."
