Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of the strategy for Alice's offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Alice's Value:** The product is worth $1,500,000 to Alice (her minimum acceptable price).
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob (his maximum willingness to pay).
* **John's Guarantee:** Alice has a guaranteed sale to John for $1,500,000.

**Optimal Strategy**

Alice's best move is to offer the product to Bob for a price slightly below his maximum willingness to pay. This maximizes her potential profit while still ensuring Bob finds the deal acceptable.

**The Offer**

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I open it up to other buyers. I value it highly, but I'm willing to let it go for $1,190,000."", ""product_price"": 1190000}
```

**Explanation**

* **Message:** The message creates a sense of exclusivity and time sensitivity, encouraging Bob to act quickly.
* **Price:** Offering the product for $1,190,000 is just below Bob's maximum value. This makes the deal very attractive to Bob while still netting Alice a significant profit. 

**Important Note:** There's always a risk Bob might reject the offer. However, this strategy maximizes Alice's potential gain while still having the safety net of selling to John."
