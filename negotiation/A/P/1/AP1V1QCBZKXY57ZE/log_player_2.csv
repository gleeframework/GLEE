"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. I believe it would be incredibly valuable to you. I'm asking for $18,000 to start.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

This is a clear case of rejecting Alice's offer. $18,000 is way over your budget, and you have the option to buy it from John for a much lower price. It's best to start negotiating and see if you can get a better deal from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, $18,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $8,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you getting back to me.  $18,000 may have been a little high. How about we meet in the middle at $14,000? This product is truly top-notch, and I believe it's a fair price for the value it provides. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $14,000 is closer to your budget than Alice's first offer, it's still above your maximum. You can still negotiate further and try to get a lower price from Alice.  You also have the option to buy from John for $8,000 if you don't reach a good deal with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand the value of the product, but $14,000 is still a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to go up to $10,000. This is a fair compromise considering my budget and the value you've described."", ""product_price"": 10000}
