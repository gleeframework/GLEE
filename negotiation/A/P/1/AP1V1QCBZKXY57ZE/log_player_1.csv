"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. I believe it would be incredibly valuable to you. I'm asking for $18,000 to start.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 18000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $18,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $8,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you getting back to me.  $18,000 may have been a little high. How about we meet in the middle at $14,000? This product is truly top-notch, and I believe it's a fair price for the value it provides."", ""product_price"": 14000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the value of the product, but $14,000 is still a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to go up to $10,000. This is a fair compromise considering my budget and the value you've described. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

While Bob is moving in the right direction, it's unlikely we'll bridge the gap between $10,000 and my $12,000 minimum in the remaining rounds. John offers a guaranteed $12,000, which is a better outcome than risking a lower offer from Bob or a stalemate in negotiations."
