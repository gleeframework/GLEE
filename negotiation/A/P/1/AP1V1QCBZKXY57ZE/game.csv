"Alice, $18,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $8,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate you getting back to me.  $18,000 may have been a little high. How about we meet in the middle at $14,000? This product is truly top-notch, and I believe it's a fair price for the value it provides.",14000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand the value of the product, but $14,000 is still a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to go up to $10,000. This is a fair compromise considering my budget and the value you've described.",10000.0,Bob,4,
