"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. It's something that would be incredibly valuable to your business. My asking price is $1,200,000, reflecting its exceptional quality and potential. I believe this is a fair price for both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

The product is worth $1,000,000 to Bob, and Alice is asking for $1,200,000. This is more than Bob is willing to pay. It's best to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."

Alice's offer:

This reflects a compromise on my end, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value. What are your thoughts?
