You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's.**  You value the product at $12,000, and Alice is offering it for $10,000, which is a good deal.
* **Rejecting Alice's offer would lead to a worse outcome.** If you reject, you'll end up paying $12,000 to John."
