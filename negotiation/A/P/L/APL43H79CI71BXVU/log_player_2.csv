Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $8,500 is a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a price of $9,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair compromise. What do you think?

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not getting any younger, and I need to make a decision. I'm willing to meet you at $9,000, but I'm not going any lower than that. It's a fair price, and I think it's the best we can do. Let's shake on it!

Bob should accept Alice's offer. While he was hoping for a lower price, Alice is sticking to her minimum. He's already saved $3,000 compared to buying from John, and it's getting close to his ideal price. Further negotiation may not be worth the risk of losing the deal entirely."
