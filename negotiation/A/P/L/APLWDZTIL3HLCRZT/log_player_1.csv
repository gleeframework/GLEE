{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $80 to you. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This is a starting point, with a price that is a compromise between my minimum price and Bob's estimated value. This gives Bob room to negotiate if he wants to, but it also leaves me some margin if Bob accepts the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $85. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $85 is better than Bob's initial valuation, it is still below my minimum acceptable price of $120. I am not yet ready to sell for that price. I will counteroffer Bob to see if we can meet in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $85 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $95? That's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to my minimum price. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 95} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $95 is a bit too high for me. How about $90? I'm willing to meet you halfway. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

$90 is still below my ideal price, but it is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price. It's likely that Bob won't go higher, so I'll accept his offer to avoid further negotiation and secure a sale."
