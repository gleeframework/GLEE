I'm starting with a high offer of $1,800,000. This gives me a good starting point for negotiation, and it's still significantly higher than my minimum acceptable value of $1,200,000. I'm confident that I can negotiate down from this price if Bob is interested."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is far too low. While I'm open to negotiation, $1,000,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable value.  I will reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

I'm countering with $1,500,000. This is still a significant profit for me, but it's a more realistic price considering Bob's low initial offer. I believe this price is fair and may be acceptable to Bob, allowing us to continue the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is now my minimum acceptable value.  While I would prefer a higher price, it's not worth risking further negotiation with Bob.  I'll accept his offer and sell the product for $1,200,000."
