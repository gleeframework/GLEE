"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer is at your maximum price point. This means there's no immediate benefit to accepting. 
* You're aiming to save money, so rejecting the offer and trying to negotiate a lower price is the best initial strategy."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* I'm starting with a counteroffer of $10,500. This is a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer, but still leaves some room for negotiation. 
* It's important to start strong, but also to be realistic.  $10,500 is still a good price for me, and it's likely Alice will be willing to negotiate from her initial price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice has lowered her price to $11,500, which is within my budget and a good deal.
* Continuing to negotiate might save me a bit more, but there's a risk that Alice might reject my counteroffer again or even increase her price. 
* Buying from John would cost me more, so accepting Alice's offer is the best choice at this point."
