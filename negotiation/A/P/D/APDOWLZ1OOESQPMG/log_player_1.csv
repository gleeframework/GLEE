Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:

``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is steadily increasing his offer and is getting closer to our minimum acceptable price. We are still in a good position to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence.  How about we split the difference and settle on $800,000? This is my final offer."", 
""product_price"": 800000
}
```

**Reasoning:**  We've reached a point where further haggling might not be productive. It's time to hold firm at our minimum acceptable price and signal that this is our final offer. This puts the pressure on Bob to either accept a fair deal or potentially lose out on the product."
