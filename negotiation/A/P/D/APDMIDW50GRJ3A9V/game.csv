"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I am looking to keep my investment within a specific budget. Would it be possible to lower the price to $1300000? I believe this would still provide us with a good value for the product while staying within my financial limits.",1300000.0,Bob,2,
