"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $90. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 Alice's starting offer is too close to your maximum budget. There's room to negotiate a better price before considering buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  That price is a bit high for me.  Would you consider $70?"",
""product_price"": 70
}
``` 

This counter-offer is a significant drop from Alice's offer but still leaves room for negotiation. It also gives Alice a chance to counter if she's not willing to go that low."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $90 might be a bit steep for you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $85. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Alice came down in price, we're still aiming for a better deal. It's worth another counter-offer to see if we can get closer to $70."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down, Alice. How about we settle at $75? That's a fair price for both of us."",
""product_price"": 75
}
```

We're splitting the difference between our previous offer and her current offer.  This shows willingness to compromise while still pushing for a price closer to our target."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $75. I'm willing to compromise and offer it to you for $82. It's still a great price, and I think you'll be happy with the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $82. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $82
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice is clearly trying to hold out for a higher price, but this offer is a reasonable compromise. It's unlikely we'll get her much lower without risking her walking away.  Accepting at $82 saves $18 compared to John's offer."
