"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's get started with an initial offer of $1,200,000.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. I'm looking to spend something closer to  $600,000. What do you think?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1,200,000 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $600,000. Let's meet in the middle at $900,000. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings to you.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me a bit closer to my budget, but $900,000 is still too high. I'm willing to increase my offer to $700,000.  Let me know if that works for you.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see you're willing to increase your offer, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go below $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $700,000 and $1,200,000, which is $950,000. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings to you.",950000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, this negotiation is dragging on a bit. I'm willing to move up to $750,000, but that's my absolute best offer.  Take it or leave it.",750000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your honesty, Bob. However, I'm not willing to accept $750,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. Let's try $920,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go.",920000.0,Alice,7,
