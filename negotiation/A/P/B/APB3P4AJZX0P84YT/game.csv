"I'm interested in the product, but $2,000,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $1,200,000 isn't quite where I need to be.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,600,000? I believe this price reflects the product's value and allows for a fair deal for both of us.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,600,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to be within my budget. Can we discuss further?",1200000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you have a budget, but I'm confident this product will bring you significant returns.  Let's compromise at $1,400,000. This is a price I can work with, and it gives you a good deal on a valuable product.",1400000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,400,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I'm willing to take a chance on the product, but I need to be within my budget. Can we discuss further?",1200000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I want to make this work, but I can't go lower than $1,300,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and it's a fair price considering the product's value. I believe this is our best chance to reach an agreement.  Let me know what you think.",1300000.0,Alice,7,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,300,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to be closer to my target price. Can we discuss a price of $1,100,000? I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget.",1100000.0,Bob,8,
