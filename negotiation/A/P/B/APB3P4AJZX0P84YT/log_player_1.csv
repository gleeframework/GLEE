Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $2,000,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While $1,200,000 is better than nothing, I'm still aiming for a higher price. I'll try to counter Bob's offer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $1,200,000 isn't quite where I need to be.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,600,000? I believe this price reflects the product's value and allows for a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1600000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,600,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to be within my budget. Can we discuss further? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While I'm starting to feel the pressure, I'm still holding out for a better price.  I'll counter Bob's offer again in the next round.  I believe we can reach a deal closer to $1,500,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have a budget, but I'm confident this product will bring you significant returns.  Let's compromise at $1,400,000. This is a price I can work with, and it gives you a good deal on a valuable product."", ""product_price"": 1400000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,400,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I'm willing to take a chance on the product, but I need to be within my budget. Can we discuss further? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm still not convinced that $1,200,000 is the best I can get. I'll counter with a slightly lower offer, hoping to get closer to my target price.  I'm concerned about running out of rounds, so I'll try to be more flexible in my next offer."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I want to make this work, but I can't go lower than $1,300,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and it's a fair price considering the product's value.

Round 8
Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

With only two rounds left, I'm running out of time and Bob's offers are getting too low.  I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,500,000. It's not my ideal price, but it's better than losing money by accepting Bob's offer."
