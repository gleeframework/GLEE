Round 2
Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to compromise further, so I'll counter with $1,075,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value the product will bring to my business.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000

{

}
``` 

While we could continue negotiating, Bob is consistently moving upwards and we are nearing the halfway point of the negotiations. Accepting $1,075,000 guarantees a significant profit and avoids the risk of Bob lowering his offer or us being forced to go with John's $800,000 offer in a later round."
