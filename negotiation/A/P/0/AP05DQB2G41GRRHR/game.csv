"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $85 is still a bit above my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $75. I'm willing to meet you halfway from $70 to $80, but I'd like to get closer to my target price.",75.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down in price, Alice, but I'm still a bit above $80. I'm willing to meet you halfway from $80 to $82, so I'll offer $81. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",81.0,Bob,6,
