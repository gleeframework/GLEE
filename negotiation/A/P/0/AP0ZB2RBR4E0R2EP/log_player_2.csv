You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your initial offer, Bob, but $60 is quite low for what this product offers.  How about we meet in the middle somewhere around $95?

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm trying to be flexible, but the price you're suggesting is too far off from what I have in mind.  My final offer is $85.  I think that's a very fair price considering its value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85

Reason: While Alice is coming closer to my acceptable price, it's still above my maximum budget. I can get the product for a guaranteed $80 from John, so it makes more sense to take that deal."
