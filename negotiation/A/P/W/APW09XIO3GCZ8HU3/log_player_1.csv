Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product is valuable,  $1,600,000 is too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $800,000. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand that the product is valuable to you, but $1,400,000 is still more than I'm willing to spend. I can offer $900,000.  This offer represents a significant investment from me and should be a fair compromise.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer. While $1,250,000 is still a bit high, I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,000,000.  This is my final offer as it represents the absolute maximum I'm prepared to invest in this product.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has made it clear that $1,000,000 is his absolute maximum price.  He's unlikely to budge from this stance. Since you have a guaranteed offer from John for $1,200,000, it makes more financial sense to sell the product to John and secure the higher profit."
