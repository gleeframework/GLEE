{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I believe you'd be interested in. I'm asking for $18,000 for it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 18000}
``` 

This offer starts high, giving us room to negotiate.  $18,000 is significantly above our minimum, but it leaves room for Bob to counteroffer without feeling like he's getting a bad deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, that's a bit more than I'm looking to spend. I'm really interested in this product, but I'm only willing to pay $12000 for it. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is our minimum, there's still room for negotiation.  We can try to get a better price by rejecting his offer and making a counter-offer.  It's unlikely we'll get our full asking price of $18,000, but we can try to meet somewhere in the middle."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  While $12,000 is our minimum, I'm willing to come down a bit to $15,000 to seal the deal. It's a fair price considering the value of this product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 15000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you have a minimum price, but I'm still only comfortable with $12000.  If you're not willing to go lower, I'll have to consider other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob is firm on his price, and we've already lowered our asking price.  At this point, it's not worth continuing to negotiate with Bob.  We can get our minimum price from John, so it's best to sell the product to him and avoid any further negotiation."
