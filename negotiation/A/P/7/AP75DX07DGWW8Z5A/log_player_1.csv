Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. I know it's a valuable piece, and I believe this price is fair considering its worth to you.  Let me know if you're interested! "", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$900,000** is a price that is higher than Bob's value of $800,000, but lower than my value of $1,000,000. 
* This gives Bob a good deal, while still allowing me to make a profit. 
* If Bob rejects the offer, I can still sell it to John for $1,000,000, so there's no risk involved in this offer."
