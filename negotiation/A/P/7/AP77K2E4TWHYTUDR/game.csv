"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to acquire a high-value product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start with a price of $15000. What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer, but $15000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $8000 for the product, which is still a good price for both of us. Let's see if we can make this work.",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $15000 was a bit steep for you, and I appreciate your willingness to make a counteroffer. However, $8000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $12000. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $12000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $9500, which is a fair price considering the value I'm placing on the product. This is my final offer, I'm ready to close the deal if you agree.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad you're willing to make a serious offer. However, $9500 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you at $11000, which is a compromise between our previous offers. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand you're still not at my price point, but I'm serious about buying this product. I can go up to $10000, which is a good compromise considering the value of the product. I'm hoping we can reach an agreement at this point.",10000.0,Bob,6,
