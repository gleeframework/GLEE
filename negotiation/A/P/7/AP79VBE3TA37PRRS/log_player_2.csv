"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's something that I'm confident you'd find incredibly useful, and I'm sure it would contribute significantly to your success.  I'm willing to offer it to you for a price of $1,200,000.  This is a significant discount from its true value, and I'm confident it's a deal you won't want to miss. Please let me know if you're interested in discussing this further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is less than your maximum budget of $1,500,000 and significantly less than buying from John. Accepting this offer saves you money."
