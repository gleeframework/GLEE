"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to present this exceptional opportunity to you. This product is not just an item; it's a game-changer that could significantly impact your business or personal endeavors. Given its unique features and the benefits it offers, I believe its true value exceeds $15000. However, I understand the importance of negotiation and am willing to start our discussion with an offer of $20000. This allows us to explore the potential synergy between the product and your needs while ensuring a fair deal. Let's discuss how we can make this work for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000.
