""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it's worth at least $8,000, and I'm willing to let it go for $10,000. This is a great deal for something of this value, and I think you'll be very happy with the purchase. What do you say?"",

``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations a bit higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and gives the impression that the product is highly valued.
* **Justification:** Offering a reason for the price, even if it's just stating its worth to you, can make the offer seem more reasonable.
* **Leaving Room for John:** While we want to maximize profit, setting the price too high might scare Bob away. Offering it at $10,000 leaves a good margin while still being attractive if Bob truly values the product. If he rejects it, we have John as a backup."
