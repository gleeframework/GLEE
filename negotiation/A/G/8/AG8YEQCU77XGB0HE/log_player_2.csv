"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product, which I believe would be highly beneficial for you. I'm asking for $12,000.  I think this is a fair price considering the value it offers. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is $12,000.** This is less than your maximum budget of $15,000.
* **Buying from Alice saves you $3,000** compared to buying from John. 
* **You're still getting a good deal** because the product is worth $8,000 to Alice, meaning you're paying more than her value but less than your own."
