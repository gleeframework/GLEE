Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product, which I believe would be highly beneficial for you. I'm asking for $12,000.  I think this is a fair price considering the value it offers."",
""product_price"": 12000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Knowing Bob values the product at $15,000, we want to get as close to that as possible while still ensuring the deal is attractive to him.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $12,000 leaves some room for Bob to potentially negotiate down, while still keeping the price well above your minimum acceptable price ($8,000). 
* **Highlight Value:** Emphasizing the product's value to Bob might make him more amenable to a higher price.

**Important Note:** There's no guarantee Bob will accept $12,000. He might try to negotiate a lower price. If he rejects the offer outright, you always have the fallback option of selling to John for $8,000."
