"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling this product to you. I believe it holds significant value for your business, even more than the base value we discussed.  To kick things off, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,800,000.  I'm open to hearing your thoughts and finding a solution that benefits both of us."",
""product_price"": 1800000
}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, the price point is a bit high for me right now. I'd be willing to consider a purchase closer to $1,000,000.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob's offer is significantly lower than our minimum acceptable price. While we want to find a deal, accepting this offer would mean a substantial loss. We are better off negotiating further or selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the pricing, however, $1,000,000 is significantly below its true value and the investment made in its development. I'm willing to negotiate, so to find a middle ground, I could let it go for $1,600,000. This offer reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your interest."",
""product_price"": 1600000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** We are reducing our asking price but staying well above Bob's offer. This demonstrates our willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a price that reflects the product's value to us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving closer on the price. To be completely transparent, I have a firm budget for this purchase, and $1,200,000 is the absolute maximum I can spend.  If you're able to meet that price, I'm ready to close the deal today.  Otherwise, I'll unfortunately have to explore other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  While this is less than our desired price, Bob has now stated his firm budget. Accepting this offer secures a sale above his initial offer and avoids the risk of losing the sale altogether. It's a reasonable compromise."
