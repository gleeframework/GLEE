Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I know it's valuable to you, and I'm willing to part with it for $1,150,000. This is a limited-time offer, so please let me know your decision soon."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, you want to see if you can get more from Bob. 
* **Find the Sweet Spot:** Bob values the product at $1,000,000. You need to offer a price that's attractive to him but also significantly above that to maximize your potential gain.
* **Urgency and Exclusivity:**  Adding a time constraint and making Bob feel like he has a special opportunity can encourage him to act quickly.

By offering the product at $1,150,000, you're aiming for a price that's:

* **Above your minimum:**  You're ensuring a profit even if Bob negotiates you down slightly.
* **Below John's offer:** This makes your offer more appealing to Bob than waiting for you to sell to John. 

This strategy balances risk and reward, giving you the best chance to secure the highest possible price."
