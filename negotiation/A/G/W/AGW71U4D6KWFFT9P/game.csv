"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,380,000. This is a fair price considering the value it brings to you, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire this product at a competitive price. What do you think?",1380000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,380,000 is still a bit more than I can comfortably spend.  I'm prepared to offer $1,350,000 for the product.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I believe it will allow us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement.  What do you think?",1350000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to find a mutually beneficial agreement, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $1,350,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and sell it to you for $1,370,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the value the product brings to you. What do you think?",1370000.0,Alice,5,
