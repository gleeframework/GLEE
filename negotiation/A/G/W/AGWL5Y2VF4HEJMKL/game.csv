"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. I'm interested in making a deal, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. Can we meet in the middle?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to make a deal, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $1200000. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I think the product's value is worth more than that. I'm offering you a price of $1800000. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial price.",1800000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I still think $1500000 is a bit high. I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $1400000. Can we meet in the middle?",1400000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're still looking for a better price, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1400000. I'm willing to compromise, but I think $1600000 is the minimum I can accept. Let's see if we can find a sweet spot.",1600000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand that you're trying to make a profit, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I've done my research and I think $1400000 is a fair price for this product. I'm willing to walk away if we can't meet at this price. Can you reconsider?",1400000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I understand you're serious about walking away, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1400000. I'm willing to make one final concession, but I think $1450000 is the absolute minimum I can accept. This is my last offer, and I hope we can meet at this price.",1450000.0,Alice,9,

"Alice, I understand that you're trying to make a profit, but I'm not willing to go above $1400000. This is my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to explore other options. I'm willing to walk away if we can't agree on a price.",1400000.0,Bob,10,
