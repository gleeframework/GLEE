Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product, it's something I know you'll find valuable. I'm asking for $18,000. Let me know what you think!"",
""product_price"": 18000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always best to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This gives you room to negotiate and still achieve a profitable outcome. 
* **Anchoring:** By offering a high initial price, you ""anchor"" Bob's perception of the product's value. Even if he negotiates down, he'll likely be willing to pay more than if you started with a lower price.
* **Alternative Buyer:** You have the security of knowing John will buy the product for $12,000. This gives you leverage in negotiations with Bob. You're not desperate to sell, so you can confidently hold out for a higher price.

**Important Note:**  This is just an initial offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters your price."
