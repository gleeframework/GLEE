"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $9,000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go. I'd be interested in paying $7,500 for the product. Let me know what you think.",7500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $7,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $8,500? I believe this price is fair for both of us. Let me know your thoughts.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still not comfortable with $8,500.  How about $8,250? That's a good compromise, and closer to my budget. Let me know what you think.",8250.0,Bob,4,
