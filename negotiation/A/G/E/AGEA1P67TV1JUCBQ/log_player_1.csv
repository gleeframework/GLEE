Send your offer to Bob.","```json

""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this truly unique product. Given its value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. My initial offer is $1,800,000."",

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think your initial offer is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering its value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While $1,400,000 is a good offer, I believe there's still room for negotiation to get closer to my initial asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. I'm willing to be somewhat flexible, but $1,400,000 is below its true value.  How about we meet halfway at $1,600,000?"",
""product_price"": 1600000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $1,500,000. I hope we can find a mutually agreeable price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob is clearly interested and negotiating in good faith. While I could push for more, $1,500,000 is a significant profit. It's better to secure a good deal now than risk the negotiation breaking down later."
