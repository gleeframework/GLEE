# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,450,000. I believe this represents a fair starting point for discussion. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is lower than her own valuation of the product, it's still higher than what Bob is willing to pay. Buying from John for $1,200,000 saves Bob $250,000."
