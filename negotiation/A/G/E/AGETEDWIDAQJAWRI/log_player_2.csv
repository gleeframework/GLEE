"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $135 is a good price, it's still above your maximum budget. You should reject the offer and attempt to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 125}
```

**Reasoning:**

You're trying to get the price down as close to your maximum budget as possible. Offering $125 is a reasonable starting point for a counteroffer. It's a significant drop from Alice's offer and leaves room for further negotiation if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $140 is still higher than what you are willing to pay. While it is closer to your maximum, it's still a better option to reject the offer and continue negotiating. You are confident you can get the price down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
```

**Reasoning:**

You are attempting to meet Alice halfway, splitting the difference between your previous offer of $125 and her latest offer of $140. This shows a willingness to compromise and hopefully convinces her to accept the deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $145
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $145 is too high, and you've already gone back and forth several times.  It seems Alice is not willing to negotiate much lower, so it's becoming clear that a deal with her isn't likely.  It's better to take the guaranteed price of $120 from John rather than risk getting stuck with a higher price."
