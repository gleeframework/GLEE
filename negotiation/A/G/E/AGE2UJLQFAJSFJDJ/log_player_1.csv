"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you this product for $1,800,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident it's worth more than that to you.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1800000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a high price, aiming to leave room for negotiation. This allows me to potentially get closer to my ideal price.
* **Confidence & Value:** I'm framing my message to imply that the product is valuable to Bob. This could make him more inclined to consider the offer.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message explicitly invites Bob to negotiate, making the offer less confrontational."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your initial offer is a bit too high for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $1000000 for it.  This is my best offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the value I place on this product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $1,000,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. 
* **Potential for Negotiation:**  While Bob's offer is unacceptable, it signals his interest in the product. I believe there's room for negotiation to reach a mutually agreeable price.
* **John's Offer:**  Selling to John for $1,200,000 is a safe option, but it might be possible to get a higher price from Bob. 

**Next Round:** I will counteroffer Bob with a price closer to my desired range, but still lower than my initial offer. This shows a willingness to negotiate while remaining firm on my value for the product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your offer.  While I appreciate your interest, $1,000,000 simply doesn't cover the value I place on this product.  How about we meet in the middle?  I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000. This is a fair price considering the benefits this product offers, and it gives us both something to work with."", ""product_price"": 1400000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm rejecting Bob's offer but showing a willingness to negotiate.
* **Meeting in the Middle:** I'm suggesting a price halfway between my initial offer and Bob's offer. This signals flexibility while still remaining above my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Value Emphasis:**  I'm reiterating the product's value to emphasize the worth of the price I'm proposing.

**Strategy:**

By making a counteroffer closer to my desired price and framing it as a compromise, I'm aiming to encourage Bob to continue negotiating and potentially reach a mutually acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $1400000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $1200000.  This is a fair price, and I believe it's a good compromise for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer Meets My Minimum:**  $1,200,000 is my minimum acceptable price. 
* **No Further Upside:**  While I could try to negotiate further, there's no guarantee I'll get a higher price, and I'm already at my minimum.
* **Risk of Losing Deal:**  If I reject Bob's offer, I risk losing the deal entirely, leaving me with only John's offer, which is the same price. 

**Conclusion:**  Accepting Bob's offer ensures a successful sale and avoids potential losses from continued negotiation."
