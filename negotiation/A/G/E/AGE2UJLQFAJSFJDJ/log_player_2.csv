"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you this product for $1800000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident it's worth more than that to you.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000

``` 

Alice's offer is far too high. It's better to reject and attempt to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your initial offer is a bit too high for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $1,000,000 for it.  This is my best offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the value I place on this product."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your offer.  While I appreciate your interest, $1000000 simply doesn't cover the value I place on this product.  How about we meet in the middle?  I'm willing to come down to $1400000. This is a fair price considering the benefits this product offers, and it gives us both something to work with. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $1,400,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $1,200,000.  This is a fair price, and I believe it's a good compromise for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
