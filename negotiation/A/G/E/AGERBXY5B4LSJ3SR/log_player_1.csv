Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm offering Bob the product for $13,000. This is a significant discount from my minimum acceptable price of $15,000, but still leaves me with a decent profit. This initial offer is designed to:

* **Gauge Bob's interest:**  If he rejects it outright, it suggests he's not serious about buying or is unwilling to pay anything close to my value.
* **Open the door for negotiation:** By starting with a lower price, I create room for Bob to counteroffer and potentially reach a price that works for both of us. 

If Bob rejects my offer, I'll carefully consider his counteroffer and use John's offer of $15,000 as a reference point to determine my next move."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $10,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  

* **Rejecting his offer keeps the negotiation alive:** By rejecting his offer, I signal that I'm not willing to settle for such a low price. 
* **Creating room for a counteroffer:** This allows me to make a counteroffer that is more in line with my desired price point.
* **Holding onto John's offer:** I'm using John's offer of $15,000 as a benchmark for my negotiation with Bob.

By rejecting Bob's offer, I maintain control of the negotiation and can try to reach a more favorable outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm countering Bob's offer of $10,000 with $12,000. This represents a compromise from my initial offer of $13,000, but it's still significantly higher than Bob's offer. 

My reasoning for this counteroffer:

* **Moving closer to a potential deal:**  This counteroffer shows Bob that I'm willing to negotiate but also that I'm not desperate to sell at a significantly discounted price. 
* **Maintaining a decent profit margin:** $12,000 is still a good profit for me, considering my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Leaving room for further negotiation:** I'm not offering my final price yet, which allows for further negotiation depending on Bob's response.

If Bob accepts this offer, I'm happy to sell. If he rejects it, I'll have to assess whether to lower my price further or stick to my minimum acceptable price and consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob has increased his offer to $11,000, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. I've already compromised significantly in my previous counteroffers, and further negotiation with Bob seems unlikely to yield a price that's worth it to me.

* **John's offer is a guaranteed profit:**  Selling to John for $15,000 ensures I reach my minimum acceptable price and get a guaranteed profit. 
* **Time and effort consideration:** Continuing to negotiate with Bob risks wasting time and effort without a guarantee of reaching a satisfactory price.

Therefore, I'm choosing to sell the product to John for $15,000.  It's the best option for me at this point, ensuring a good profit and minimizing potential risk."
