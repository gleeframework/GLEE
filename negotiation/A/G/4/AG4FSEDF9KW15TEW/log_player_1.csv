{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. I know it's a valuable asset and I believe this price reflects its worth. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price that's significantly above what the product is worth to Bob, but still below my minimum. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Reasonable Offer:**  The price is  reasonable given my minimum value and Bob's likely maximum. 
* **Positive Tone:** My message is friendly and open to negotiation. 

**Strategy:**

This opening offer sets the stage for a potential negotiation. I've given Bob a good reason to consider my offer while still leaving myself room to compromise if necessary. If he rejects, I'll assess his counteroffer and decide if it's worth continuing negotiations or if I'm better off selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time and effort, but I'm interested in purchasing the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** $900,000 is far below my minimum acceptable value of $1,500,000. It's also significantly lower than my initial offer of $1,400,000.
* **Potential for Negotiation:** While Bob's offer is unacceptable, it shows he's serious about buying and is willing to negotiate.
* **Opportunity to Increase the Price:** I believe I can push for a higher price with a counteroffer.

**Strategy:**

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can make a counteroffer and hopefully reach a price closer to my minimum. This strategy allows me to potentially maximize my profit while keeping the negotiation open."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have a budget to work with, but $900,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000.  This reflects the true value of the product while giving you a significant price advantage over buying it from John.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise, But Not Too Much:** My counteroffer is a significant drop from my initial offer, showing I'm willing to negotiate. However, it's still well above Bob's offer and closer to my minimum acceptable value.
* **Highlighting the Value:** I emphasize the product's value and the advantage Bob would get by buying from me instead of John.
* **Collaborative Tone:** The message maintains a positive and collaborative tone, encouraging Bob to continue the negotiation.

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer aims to bridge the gap between our two positions. It shows a willingness to compromise while still protecting my interests.  I'm hoping Bob sees the value proposition and agrees to a deal closer to my target price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1200000, but I'm still a bit far from my budget. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so I'll offer $1000000. I'm confident that's a fair price considering the product's value and my budget constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too Low:**  While Bob is moving closer to my minimum price, $1,000,000 is still significantly below my desired target.  
* **Potential for a Better Deal:**  Bob's offer shows that he's willing to negotiate further, indicating a potential for a higher price. 
* **Risk of Selling to John:** Selling to John for $1,500,000 is tempting, but it eliminates any chance of getting closer to my ideal price.

**Strategy:**

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can continue to negotiate and try to push for a higher price.  I'm betting that I can get closer to my minimum acceptable value without jeopardizing the deal.  This strategy involves a bit of risk, but the potential reward of a higher price outweighs the safety of selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $1,000,000 is still a bit below what I need to accept.  I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last offers.  How about $1,100,000? It's a fair price considering the value of the product and your budget, and it would get this deal done.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise & Leverage:** This counteroffer is a compromise, but still keeps the price significantly above Bob's offer. It also subtly leverages the fact that Bob is closer to his budget limit, making him more likely to accept.
* **Clear & Concise:** The message is clear and concise, focusing on the price and the mutual benefit of closing the deal.
* **Sense of Urgency:** The phrase ""get this deal done"" creates a subtle sense of urgency, potentially influencing Bob to make a decision.

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer aims to find a middle ground between our current positions. It shows that I am flexible while still protecting my interests.  If Bob rejects, I will have to weigh the risk of continuing to negotiate against the guaranteed sale to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $1100000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1050000, but that's my final offer. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  While Bob has increased his offer, $1,050,000 is still well below my minimum acceptable value of $1,500,000.  
* **No Further Room for Negotiation:**  Bob has declared this his final offer, leaving little room for further compromise.
* **Risk of Stalemate:**  Continuing to negotiate could lead to a stalemate, wasting time and potentially jeopardizing the sale to John.

**Strategy:**

It's time to cut my losses and sell to John.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my ideal price, the risk of continued negotiation with Bob outweighs the potential reward.  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum acceptable value and ensures a quick and certain sale."
