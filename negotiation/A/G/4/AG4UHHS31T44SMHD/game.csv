"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but I'm still confident that the product's value justifies a higher price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. Let's try $1100000. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I see you're trying to get closer to the price I'm looking for, Bob. I appreciate your persistence. However, I still need to make a profit, and $1075000 is a bit too low for me. Let's try to meet in the middle again. How about $1090000?",1090000.0,Alice,5,
