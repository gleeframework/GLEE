"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I think it would be incredibly valuable to you. I'm asking for $20,000.  What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $20,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,000 for it, which is still a fair price considering its value to me. Let me know what you think.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to negotiate, so how about we meet in the middle at $16,000?",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you value the product highly, but $16,000 is still out of my price range. I'm willing to go up to $10,000, which is a significant compromise for me.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $10,000 is still quite a bit lower than I'd like, but to show I'm willing to be flexible, how about $14,000?",14000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer. $14,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $12,000, which is a fair compromise.  Let's try to reach an agreement that works for both of us.",12000.0,Bob,6,
