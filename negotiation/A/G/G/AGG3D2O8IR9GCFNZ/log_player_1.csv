Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1700000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($1,500,000) to leave room for negotiation.  Since the product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob, I'm hoping to get as close as possible to my desired price while still making the offer attractive enough for him to consider."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $1,300,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not satisfied with the price. I believe there's room for negotiation, and I'm willing to try for a better deal before settling."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

I'm lowering my price from the initial offer, but still keeping it above my minimum. I'm hoping that this counteroffer will be more appealing to Bob, while still allowing me to earn a significant amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,400,000 is close to my minimum price, and I'm willing to accept it to avoid the risk of further negotiation and potentially having to sell to John for a lower price."
