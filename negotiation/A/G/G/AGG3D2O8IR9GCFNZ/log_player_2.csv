You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,700,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than what the product is worth to Bob ($1,700,000 vs. $1,200,000). It's always beneficial to negotiate further or explore other options when the initial offer is unfavorable."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a starting point for negotiation. It's significantly lower than Alice's offer but still above Bob's maximum price point. This shows Alice that Bob is serious about buying the product but wants a fair price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial offer, it's still above Bob's maximum price point.  Since John is willing to sell for $1,200,000, there's still room for negotiation with Alice.  Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation open to potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a slight increase from the previous one, showing Alice that Bob is willing to compromise but still wants a price closer to his maximum. It also leaves room for Alice to counteroffer before Bob considers buying from John."
