"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this unique product, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire something truly valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000, which is the minimum price I'm willing to accept. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is the lowest she's willing to go.  While it's lower than John's price, there's still room for negotiation to potentially save even more."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,400,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is higher than my ideal price, but it's still lower than buying from John.  There's still room for negotiation, and I can try to get a better price."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,400,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm prepared to pay $1,100,000. This represents a significant saving for you compared to selling to John and still leaves you with a healthy profit. "", ""product_price"": 1100000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to save money, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,100,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $1,300,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,300,000 is a good deal. It's significantly lower than what John is offering and still leaves room for profit for Alice.  While I could try to negotiate further, the risk of Alice walking away and me having to buy from John at a higher price outweighs the potential savings."
