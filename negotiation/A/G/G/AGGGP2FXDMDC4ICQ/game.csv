"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a little too high for me.  Would you be willing to come down to $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. How about we meet in the middle at $10,500? It's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  How about we split the difference and settle at $9,750?",9750.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $9,750. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit. How about we try $10,250? It's still a great deal for you, and it's closer to my minimum price.",10250.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting close.  I'm willing to offer $9,900.  That's a fair compromise, don't you think?",9900.0,Bob,6,

"I can see you're serious about getting a good deal, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $10,100? It's still a bit higher than your last offer, but it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",10100.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, this is my final offer, take it or leave it. $10,000 seems more than fair.",10000.0,Bob,8,
