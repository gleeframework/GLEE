Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1450000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's significantly higher than your minimum, but still lower than the product's value to Bob. This leaves room for negotiation without making you feel like you're giving away too much."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, it's still lower than I'd like to get. I'll counteroffer to see if we can find a price that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1425000} 
```

I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer, but I still believe this price reflects the value of the product. I hope Bob will see that this is a fair deal for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, but I'm still hoping for a better deal. I'll counteroffer one more time before considering selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1375000} 
```

This is my final counteroffer. It's a significant compromise, but I still believe it's a fair price given the product's value. If Bob rejects this offer, I'll move forward with selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,320,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,320,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting dangerously close to my minimum, but it's still below what I'm aiming for.  At this point, it's not worth risking further negotiation with Bob.  John's offer is a guaranteed sale at a price that meets my minimum requirement. I'll accept John's offer and move on."
