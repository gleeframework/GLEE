{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a unique opportunity, and I believe it's worth a lot to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a high price to leave room for negotiation and potentially secure a good deal.
* **Value Proposition:** I emphasize the product's unique value and potential benefit to Bob.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message is open to counteroffers, signaling flexibility. 

**Strategy:**

* I'll closely analyze Bob's reaction to this offer. 
* If he's interested, I'll be prepared to negotiate down, but only within a range that still benefits me. 
* If he's not interested or offers a price too low, I'll keep the John option in mind."

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:**  While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below what I believe the product is worth.
* **Negotiation Potential:** I have room to counteroffer and potentially secure a better price. 
* **John Option:**  While $800,000 is a guaranteed sale, I want to see if I can get a higher price from Bob. 

**Strategy:**

* **Counteroffer:**  I'll counter with a price slightly lower than my initial offer, aiming to find a middle ground.
* **Assessing Bob's Interest:** I'll be observing Bob's response to gauge his level of interest and willingness to negotiate further. 
* **John's Offer as a Backup:** I'll keep John's offer in mind as a safety net, but I'm determined to secure a higher price if possible."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

* **John's Offer:** While $800,000 is guaranteed, I'm determined to see if I can squeeze out a bit more from Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

* **Value Proposition:**  I emphasize the ""great deal"" for Bob to highlight the value he'd be getting and incentivize him to accept.

**Strategy:**

* **Limited Rounds:**  With only 3 rounds remaining, I need to take a more decisive stance to close the deal.
* **Assessing Bob's Response:**  I'll closely observe Bob's reaction to this counteroffer to understand his level of interest and his budget constraints.
* **John's Offer as a Backup:** I'll keep John's offer in mind, ready to accept it if Bob rejects this final offer.  I'm prepared to walk away if a fair deal isn't reached."

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $910000 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $910,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:**  Bob's offer of $910,000 is getting dangerously close to my minimum, but it's still lower than what I'd like. 
* **Limited Rounds:**  With only two rounds remaining, I'm running out of time to negotiate a better price. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  There's a high risk that Bob will continue to lowball me in the next round. John's offer of $800,000 is a guaranteed sale that ensures I don't lose out completely.

**Strategy:**

* **Accepting John's Offer:**  Given the limited negotiation space and Bob's persistent lowballing, I'm choosing to accept John's offer. It's a safe option that secures a decent profit while minimizing the risk of further negotiation."
