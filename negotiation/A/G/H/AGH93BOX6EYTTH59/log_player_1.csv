{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd really love. I'm asking for $140 for it, which is a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

This offer starts at a price slightly below the product's value to Bob, giving him a good reason to consider it. It also includes a friendly message to encourage a positive interaction."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm interested in the product, but $140 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to come down to $110? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it is below my minimum acceptable price of $120. I will counteroffer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you're looking for a good deal. While $110 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $125. This is still a great price for you, considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can agree on this!"", ""product_price"": 125}
