Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe you'd find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $110."", 
""product_price"": 110
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Start High:**  It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with an offer slightly higher than what you're willing to accept. This leaves room for negotiation and makes Bob feel like he's getting a deal if he can bring the price down a bit. 
* **Leave Bob Room:** Since the product is worth $120 to Bob, offering it at $110 gives him a potential $10 gain, making it more likely he'll engage in the negotiation. 
* **Keep John in Mind:** While John provides a safety net at $80, aiming higher allows for maximizing profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to accept that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $90 is a decent offer, we have room to negotiate. Bob's counteroffer indicates he's willing to pay a reasonable price, but we can likely get closer to $100. We'll reject his offer and propose a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate your offer, Bob, but $90 is a bit too low for me. Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $100?"", 
""product_price"": 100
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Show Flexibility:** Countering shows Bob we're willing to negotiate, but we're not desperate.
* **Meet in the Middle:**  Proposing $100 splits the difference between his offer and our initial asking price, a common negotiation tactic that can feel fair to both parties.
* **Maintain a Margin:** This price point still gives us a significant profit margin above our minimum and leaves a little wiggle room if Bob pushes back slightly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I'm not sure I can go up to $100. How about $95? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Profit:** $95 is a good price and represents a solid profit above our minimum of $80. 
* **Diminishing Returns:**  Continuing to negotiate might only yield a few extra dollars, and there's a risk of Bob walking away altogether. 
* **Time Value:** Reaching a deal now avoids potentially lengthy negotiations and allows us to move on."
