"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested, but $900,000 is a bit steep for me.  How about we settle on $650,000?  I think that's a fair price.",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $650,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000, which is still a great deal for you.  Let's try to find a middle ground here.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  While $850,000 is closer, it's still a bit higher than what I had in mind. Would you consider $725,000? That would be a workable figure for me.",725000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $725,000 is still a bit low. Let's meet in the middle at $800,000.  This price is fair for both of us and allows us to close this deal.  What do you say?",800000.0,Alice,5,
