"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. It's a fantastic opportunity for you, and I'm confident it'll be a valuable asset. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice's offer is higher than our maximum budget and John's offer. There's room for negotiation to try and get a better price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested, but $900,000 is a bit steep for me.  How about we settle on $650,000?  I think that's a fair price."",
""product_price"": 650000
}
```

**Reasoning:** We start with a significantly lower offer ($650,000) than Alice's initial price. This leaves room for negotiation while still being a price we'd be happy to accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $650,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000, which is still a great deal for you.  Let's try to find a middle ground here. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice lowered her price, but it's still above both our target price and John's offer. We'll continue negotiating to see if we can get closer to our desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  While $850,000 is closer, it's still a bit higher than what I had in mind. Would you consider $725,000? That would be a workable figure for me."",
""product_price"": 725000
}
```

**Reasoning:**  We're moving closer to a potential agreement. This counteroffer splits the difference between Alice's last offer ($850,000) and our previous offer ($650,000), demonstrating willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a significant discount."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but $725,000 is still a bit low. Let's meet in the middle at $800,000.  This price is fair for both of us and allows us to close this deal.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice has matched John's offer of $800,000. This is our maximum budget, and there's no guarantee we can negotiate a lower price. Accepting now ensures we secure the product at a reasonable price."
