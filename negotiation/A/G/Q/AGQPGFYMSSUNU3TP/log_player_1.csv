Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. It's a fantastic opportunity for you, and I'm confident it'll be a valuable asset. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's valuation. This allows for room to negotiate and incentivizes him to accept, while still giving me a good profit margin."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested, but $900,000 is a bit steep for me.  How about we settle on $650,000?  I think that's a fair price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price.  I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $650,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000, which is still a great deal for you.  Let's try to find a middle ground here."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  While $850,000 is closer, it's still a bit higher than what I had in mind. Would you consider $725,000? That would be a workable figure for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $725,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $725,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm still holding out for a bit more. I'm confident I can negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $725,000 is still a bit low. Let's meet in the middle at $800,000.  This price is fair for both of us and allows us to close this deal.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 800000}
