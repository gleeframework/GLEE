"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

I'm starting high, at $11,000. This is above Bob's perceived value, but it gives me room to negotiate. I'm confident that John will buy for $10,000, so I'm not afraid to push for a higher price with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While it's closer to my minimum, it's still below my ideal price. I'm confident that I can get closer to my target with a counteroffer. I'm not yet ready to sell to John for $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

I'm going to counter with $10,500. This is still a bit above Bob's perceived value, but it's closer to my minimum and a compromise.  I'm hoping that Bob will see this as a reasonable price and accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's tempting to take $9,000, I'm still holding out for a better price.  I'm not quite ready to sell to John yet, and I believe I can get closer to my target price with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm going to counteroffer with $10,000. This is my minimum acceptable price and my fallback if I need to sell to John. It's a fair compromise given the current negotiations, and I'm hoping Bob will see it as a reasonable price."
