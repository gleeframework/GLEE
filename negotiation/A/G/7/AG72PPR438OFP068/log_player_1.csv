Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, $1,000,000 is a bit steep for my budget. I'd be willing to pay $600,000 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counter-offer.  However, $600,000 undervalues the product significantly. I'm willing to come down to $900,000. I'm confident this price reflects the true value you'll be getting."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer.  $850,000 is still a bit high for me.  How about $750,000? This offer reflects a serious commitment on my end to reach a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000

}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is slowly increasing his offer, it's clear he's unlikely to meet my minimum price of $800,000 within the remaining rounds.  Selling to John guarantees I get my desired price without further negotiation and potential risk of losing both buyers."
