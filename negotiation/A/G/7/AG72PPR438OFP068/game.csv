"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, $1,000,000 is a bit steep for my budget. I'd be willing to pay $600,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counter-offer.  However, $600,000 undervalues the product significantly. I'm willing to come down to $900,000. I'm confident this price reflects the true value you'll be getting.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand the product's value, but I have a budget to stick to. I can go up to $700,000. That's a significant investment on my part, and I believe it's a fair compromise.",700000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm seeing a willingness to find common ground here, which I appreciate. How about we meet in the middle at $850,000?  This reflects the product's value while acknowledging your budget concerns.",850000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer.  $850,000 is still a bit high for me.  How about $750,000? This offer reflects a serious commitment on my end to reach a deal.",750000.0,Bob,6,
