Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $11,500 is a bit higher than I'd like to spend.  I'm willing to pay $11,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my desired price, I still think I can get more. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a bit higher than that.  How about $11,250?  That's a fair compromise, and still a great deal for you considering the product's value.  Let's get this deal done!"", ""product_price"": 11250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $11,250 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $11,100.  Let's meet in the middle and get this deal done. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While it's not my ideal price, it's a good deal and we're close to reaching an agreement.  It's better to close the deal now than to risk losing him and having to sell to John for a lower price."
