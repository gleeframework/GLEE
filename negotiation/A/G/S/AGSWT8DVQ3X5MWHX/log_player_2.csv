Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $850,000 is a bit steep for you, but I need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $775,000. This is my best offer for now.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're serious about buying the product, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving too much on the table. I'll meet you at $750,000, but that's as low as I can go. This is my final offer.

``` 

At this point, Alice has come down considerably and is offering a price significantly lower than John's $800,000. While we could try to negotiate further, there's a risk Alice might retract the offer or we waste valuable rounds. Accepting the $750,000 secures a good deal and avoids the risk of having to buy from John at a higher price."
