Round 3
Alice's offer:

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your continued interest. I understand where you're coming from, but I need to be realistic about the value of this product. How about we meet in the middle at $900,000?  This is my final offer.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000

**Reasoning:**  Alice has stated this is her final offer, and it's still above your maximum price. You can get the product from John for $800,000, guaranteeing you stay within your budget. There's no point in continuing the negotiation with Alice if she's unwilling to meet your price."
