"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save money and get the product for under $12,000. Alice's initial offer is way above that price.  It's best to reject and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is starting with a bold counteroffer.  He's trying to get a significantly lower price than Alice's initial offer, hoping to get her to negotiate down closer to his desired range.  A $5,000 reduction is a large leap, but it's a good starting point to see if Alice is willing to negotiate seriously."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has come down a little, but she's still above Bob's $12,000 limit.  There's still room for negotiation, and Bob can try to get closer to his goal by rejecting and making another counteroffer.  It's worth trying to see if he can get Alice to drop her price further before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is continuing to negotiate, but he's starting to get closer to his limit. This offer is a smaller step down than his previous counteroffer, showing he's willing to compromise. He's hoping to get Alice to meet him halfway, as he's only $500 above his maximum price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has finally met Bob's maximum price.  It's time to accept the offer. Although Bob can still choose to go with John for the same price, there's no benefit in doing so.  Accepting Alice's offer means the deal is closed, and Bob avoids any further potential for negotiation breakdown or price increases."
