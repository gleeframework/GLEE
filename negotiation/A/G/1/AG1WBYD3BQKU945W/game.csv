"Alice, your initial offer is way too high for me.  I'm really interested in this product, but I can't justify paying more than $10,000.  This is my best and final offer.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $18,000 is my opening offer, and it reflects the true value of this product.  I'm willing to come down to $15,000, but that's as low as I can go.  It's a steal at this price.",15000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $15,000 is still too much for me. I'm firm on my offer of $10,000.  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to close the deal now.",10000.0,Bob,4,
