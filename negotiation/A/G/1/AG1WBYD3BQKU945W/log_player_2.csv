"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you today at a premium price of $18,000. I know this is a unique item, and I believe it will be a valuable asset for you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Alice's initial offer is way too high. It's significantly above your maximum budget and even above the product's worth to her.  There's no reason to accept it at this point. It's better to reject and start negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your initial offer is way too high for me.  I'm really interested in this product, but I can't justify paying more than $10,000.  This is my best and final offer."", ""product_price"": 10000} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $18,000 is my opening offer, and it reflects the true value of this product.  I'm willing to come down to $15,000, but that's as low as I can go.  It's a steal at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice has come down slightly, but her offer is still too high for me. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I'm sticking to my maximum budget of $10,000.  There's no sense in accepting this offer when I can get it from John for less."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $15,000 is still too much for me. I'm firm on my offer of $10,000.  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to close the deal now."", ""product_price"": 10000}
