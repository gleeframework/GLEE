"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. It's too high, and he can likely get a better deal by counter-offering or buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500} 
``` 

Bob is offering $8,500, which is a significant discount from Alice's asking price and a reasonable starting point for negotiations. This offer is still within Bob's budget and leaves some room for Alice to make a counteroffer without feeling like she's losing too much."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While $9,500 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his ideal price. There's room to negotiate further, and Bob still has the option of buying from John for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000} 
```

Bob is offering $9,000, which is a compromise between his previous offer and Alice's latest one.  He's showing a willingness to meet halfway, while still trying to save money.  This also puts some pressure on Alice to make a decision as it's closer to her desired price."
