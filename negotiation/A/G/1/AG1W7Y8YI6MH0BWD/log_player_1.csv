"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm starting with my target price, knowing that I can always go lower if necessary. I'm confident that Bob will be willing to negotiate, but I want to see if he's truly interested in the product and willing to pay a price close to my valuation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low. While it's closer to my valuation than his initial offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I won't settle for anything less than $9,000. I'm confident that I can get a better price from Bob or John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

I'm raising my offer slightly from my initial counteroffer. While I'm still willing to negotiate, I'm showing Bob that I'm firm in my price and that I'm not going to settle for a price that's significantly lower than my valuation.  I'm hoping that this will encourage Bob to come closer to my desired price point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $9,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price. While I would ideally like to get closer to my initial asking price, I need to consider the risk of further negotiation. There are only six rounds remaining, and it's possible that Bob could reject my counteroffers and I might end up with a lower price or no deal at all.  Selling to John for $10,000 is a safer option, but it would mean leaving some money on the table.  Therefore, I'm going to accept Bob's offer and secure the sale."
