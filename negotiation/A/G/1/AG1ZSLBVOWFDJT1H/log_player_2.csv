Alice's offer:

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm willing to negotiate further, but $75 is still too low.  Let's meet in the middle at $100. I think that's a fair price that benefits us both.

Alice is very unlikely to go below $100. It's better to take the guaranteed deal from John at $80 and avoid further unsuccessful negotiation."
