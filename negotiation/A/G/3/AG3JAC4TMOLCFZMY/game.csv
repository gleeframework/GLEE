"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1400000. This is a very competitive price, and I believe it's a great deal for both of us.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. I believe that's a fair price considering the market value. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider my counteroffer?",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1200000. I'm willing to compromise and offer you a price of $1300000. This is still a great deal, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value. I'm open to further negotiations, but I need to stay within my own budget. What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $1300000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my limit. Can you consider $1250000? I think that's a fair price, and I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase the product if we can agree on this price.",1250000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, and I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, and offer you a price of $1295000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",1295000.0,Alice,5,
