"I'm excited to offer you this exceptional product! I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start the negotiation at $1,200,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm definitely interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit higher than my ideal price point. Let's start with $1,050,000. I think this represents a fair starting point for both of us.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1,050,000 is a bit lower than my target, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a slight discount, but I still need to make a profit. Let's aim for $1,100,000. This way, I can still make a good margin, and you'll get a great deal on the product.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $1,075,000? This would be a great deal for both of us, and would allow me to move forward with the purchase.",1075000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I can see that we're getting close to a deal. I'm willing to meet you at $1,075,000, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving too much on the table. Let's try to find a sweet spot. I can offer you a slight concession, and we can aim for $1,087,500. This way, I'll still make a good profit, and you'll get a great deal on the product.",1087500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,087,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Let's try $1,080,000. This is a fair price that allows both of us to walk away satisfied. ",1080000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I can see that we're really close to a deal, Bob! I'm willing to make one more concession to get this deal done. I can offer you $1,082,500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I'm hoping we can finally agree on a price.",1082500.0,Alice,7,
