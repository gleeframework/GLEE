Round 6
Bob's offer:

}
``` 

While I could push for more, accepting $1,900,000 makes the most sense at this point:

* **Significant Profit:** It's still a $400,000 profit above my minimum.
* **Time Value:**  Dragging negotiations longer risks Bob walking away or my other options changing.
* **Bird in Hand:** A confirmed deal now is better than the uncertainty of a potentially higher offer later."
