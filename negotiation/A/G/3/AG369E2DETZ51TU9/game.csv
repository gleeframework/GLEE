"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start the negotiation at $1,100,000. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product.  However,  $1,100,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows.  I'm willing to offer $950,000 for the product. This reflects the value I see in it, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. What do you think?",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $950,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,050,000. This is a significant discount from my original price, and I believe it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $1,050,000 is still a bit higher than what I can comfortably afford.  I'm willing to offer $1,000,000, which is the maximum I can pay at this time.  It's a fair price, and I'm confident we can both be happy with this outcome.",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your concerns, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer $1,025,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price for the product. What do you think?",1025000.0,Alice,5,
