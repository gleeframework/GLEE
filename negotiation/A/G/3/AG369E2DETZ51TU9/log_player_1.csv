Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product.  However,  $1,100,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows.  I'm willing to offer $950,000 for the product. This reflects the value I see in it, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $1,050,000 is still a bit higher than what I can comfortably afford.  I'm willing to offer $1,000,000, which is the maximum I can pay at this time.  It's a fair price, and I'm confident we can both be happy with this outcome.
