"I understand you're looking to save a bit on the price, Bob. However, I've got to make a profit on this deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $105 for the product. Can we discuss a price between $90 and $105?",105.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. How about we settle on $97? That's a fair price that works for both of us.",97.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, $97 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get at least $105 for the product. I'm willing to meet you at $100, but that's my final offer on that price. What do you think?",100.0,Alice,5,
