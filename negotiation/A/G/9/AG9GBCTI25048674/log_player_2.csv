Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, $97 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get at least $105 for the product. I'm willing to meet you at $100, but that's my final offer on that price. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice has come down to her own valuation of the product. It's unlikely she'll go any lower, and this price is well within our budget. Accepting the offer now ensures we get the product at a good price."
