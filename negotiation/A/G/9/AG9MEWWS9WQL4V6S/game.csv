"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $125. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",125.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $125 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $150? That's a fair price for both of us.",150.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I'm happy to negotiate, but $137.50 is still a bit too low. I'm willing to go down to $145. This is my final offer.",145.0,Alice,5,
