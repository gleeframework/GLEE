"Dear Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to work with me to find a mutually beneficial price. However, I'm still a bit above $1600000. I'm willing to go up to $1500000, but I'm not sure I can go any higher. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to be mindful of my budget.
