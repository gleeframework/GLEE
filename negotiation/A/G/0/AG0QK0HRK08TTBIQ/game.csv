"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. After considering your potential interest, I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset, and I believe it's a fair price considering its worth to you.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm very interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider a price closer to $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $825,000. This is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you and the original price I had in mind.",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While I see the value, $825,000 is still a bit over my limit.  Would you be willing to come down to $760,000? I feel this represents a fair deal for both of us.",760000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $760,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my original price. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $800,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's still a fair deal considering the product's value to you.",800000.0,Alice,5,
