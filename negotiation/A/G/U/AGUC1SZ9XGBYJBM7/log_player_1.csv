Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $175. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful."", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, but still lower than my minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive Messaging:** The message is friendly and emphasizes the value of the product. 
* **Negotiation Potential:** By leaving room for Bob to counteroffer, I can gauge his interest and potentially find a price we both agree on. 
* **Back-up Plan:** If Bob rejects, I have John as a guaranteed buyer at my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** $120 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150. Accepting it would result in a loss for me.
* **Negotiation Potential:** While Bob is showing interest, his offer is too far off. I believe I can still get a better price by counter-offering.
* **John as a Safety Net:**  Knowing I can sell to John for $150 gives me the flexibility to be more assertive in negotiations with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I understand your offer,  $120 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $145?  That way, we both get a good deal."", ""product_price"": 145}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-offer:**  I'm proposing a price that's closer to my desired price point, but still acknowledges Bob's interest.
* **Compromise:**  The message focuses on a ""split the difference"" approach, implying fairness and a willingness to negotiate.
* **Maintain Leverage:** $145 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $150, leaving room for further negotiation if needed.
* **John as a Safety Net:**  I'm confident I can sell to John if Bob doesn't accept my counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I think $130 is a more reasonable price for me. Can you consider it? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Still Low:** While Bob has moved closer to my desired price, $130 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  
* **Negotiation Potential:** There's still a gap between our desired prices, and I believe further negotiation is possible. 
* **John as a Safety Net:** Knowing I can sell to John for $150 allows me to take a risk and keep negotiating with Bob. 
* **Opportunity Cost:** Accepting Bob's offer would result in a lower price than I could get from John, which is my best alternative."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $130 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $140? That seems like a fair price considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 140}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-offer:** I'm offering a price that is closer to my desired price, but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Compromise:** I'm emphasizing the word ""middle"" to suggest fairness and a willingness to meet halfway.
* **Maintain Leverage:** $140 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $150, giving me the opportunity to get a better deal if Bob is willing to compromise further.
* **John as a Safety Net:** I'm confident I can sell to John if Bob doesn't accept my counteroffer, so I'm not afraid to push for a price closer to my desired outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close, but I still think $135 is a better price for me. Can you consider it? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $135
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Opportunity Cost:** Bob's offer of $135 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150. Continuing to negotiate with him risks losing time and ultimately ending up with a lower price. 
* **Guaranteed Sale:** Selling to John guarantees me my minimum acceptable price. This is a sure thing, while further negotiation with Bob is uncertain.
* **Time Value:** The negotiation process is taking time, and it's likely that continuing with Bob will only result in more back-and-forth with no guarantee of a better price. 

I'm confident that selling to John is the most rational decision given the current situation."
