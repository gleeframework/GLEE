"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $135.  It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 135}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above Bob's value:** This gives Bob some room to negotiate and feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **It's below your minimum:** This ensures you're still getting a profit.
* **It's a clear starting point:** This sets the tone for the negotiation and makes it clear what you're looking for."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer!  $135 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is too low, it's below my minimum value of $150. I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $120.  That's still a good deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 120}
