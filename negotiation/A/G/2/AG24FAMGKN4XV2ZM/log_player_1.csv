Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. Given its value, I'm asking for $20,000. I'm open to discussing a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 20000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Start high:** Opening with a price significantly higher than both your minimum ($15,000) and Bob's perceived value ($12,000) gives you room to negotiate downwards. 
* **Gauge Bob's interest:**  This offer will help you understand how eager Bob is to purchase the product and how much he might be willing to pay.
* **Alternative option:** Keep in mind that you have John as a backup buyer at $15,000. This knowledge allows you to be more assertive in your negotiation with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I'm looking to save as much as possible. I'm willing to pay $15,000 for the product. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While I started high, Bob's offer of $15,000 matches my minimum acceptable price. There's no guarantee I can negotiate a higher price with him, and waiting carries the risk of him reducing his offer or walking away. Accepting his offer guarantees I make my desired profit."
