"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested but $90 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. How about $75?",75.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $90 might be a bit steep for you. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we try $82? It's a great compromise, and I think you'll find it's still a fantastic deal.",82.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $82 is still a little high for me. I'm happy to pay $78, which is closer to my budget. What do you think?",78.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $82 is still a bit too high for you, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession. How about we try $80? It's the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",80.0,Alice,5,
