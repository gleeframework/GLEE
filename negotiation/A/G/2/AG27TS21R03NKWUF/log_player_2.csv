"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

The product is worth no more than $120 to Bob, and Alice's offer is significantly higher. It's better to reject the offer and see if he can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob is aiming to get the price down as much as possible. A counteroffer of $100 is a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer of $150, making it a reasonable starting point for negotiation. This counteroffer still leaves some room for compromise and allows Bob to gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer of $130 is closer to Bob's maximum value of $120, it's still higher than what he's willing to pay. It's worth rejecting the offer and continuing to negotiate for a lower price. There are still rounds available to potentially secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 115}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is getting closer to his maximum value of $120. A counteroffer of $115 shows a willingness to compromise while still leaving room for Alice to negotiate further. This counteroffer signals that Bob is serious about buying the product but is still looking for a better price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer of $125 is getting closer to Bob's maximum value, it's still higher than what he's willing to pay. Bob has a backup option with John, who is selling the product for $120, so it makes sense to reject Alice's offer and continue negotiating for a lower price. There are still rounds available to try and get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is now at his maximum value for the product. This counteroffer is a final attempt to get the price down to his desired level. If Alice rejects, Bob will buy from John at $120, ensuring he doesn't overpay. This offer shows that Bob is willing to close the deal but won't go higher."
