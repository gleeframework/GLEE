"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $200. I think you'll find it's a great deal for its value."", ""product_price"": 200}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $200 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $150 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is offering the maximum he's willing to pay, which is still below your minimum acceptable price. There's no room for further negotiation to reach a price you'd accept. Selling to John guarantees you your desired profit with no further hassle."
