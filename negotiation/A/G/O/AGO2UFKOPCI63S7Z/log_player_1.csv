Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer but $1,400,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. It's a fair price considering your value for it, and it's within my budget. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $1,300,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,250,000. This would be a good deal for both of us, allowing you to make a profit while I stay within my budget. What do you think?
