{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  You want to save as much money as possible. $1,400,000 is still above your target of $1,500,000.
* **You have room to negotiate.**  You have 10 rounds and can make counteroffers, which gives you leverage."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer but $1,400,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. It's a fair price considering your value for it, and it's within my budget. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,200,000. Let's split the difference - I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,300,000. This price reflects the product's value to both of us.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $1,300,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,250,000. This would be a good deal for both of us, allowing you to make a profit while I stay within my budget. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1250000}

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see we're getting closer.  I'm willing to come down to $1,275,000. It's a fair price that acknowledges the product's value to you and allows me to make a reasonable profit. Let's reach a deal on this.

* **Alice's offer is within your budget.** $1,275,000 is below your target of $1,500,000.
* **You're making progress.**  You've successfully negotiated a lower price than Alice's initial offer. 
* **Risk of losing the deal:**  While you could try to push for a lower price, there's a risk that Alice will walk away or you'll run out of rounds.  Accepting this offer secures the product at a good price."
