"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I do believe the product is valuable, $12,000 is a bit steep for my budget. Would you consider a price closer to $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $12,000 might be a stretch for your budget, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $11,000. It's still a great deal, considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a more affordable option, and I'm willing to work with you. However, I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $10,500. It's a compromise between our previous offers, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,5,
