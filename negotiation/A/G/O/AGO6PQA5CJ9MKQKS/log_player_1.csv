Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I know it's incredibly valuable to you, and I'm confident you'll find my offer more than fair. What do you say to a price of $1,900,000?"",
""product_price"": 1900000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,000,000, I can afford to start with a significantly higher offer to Bob.  This maximizes potential profit.
* **Testing the Waters:** The $1,900,000 offer is ambitious. Bob's response (acceptance, counter-offer, or rejection) will give me valuable information about his perceived value of the product.
* **Justification:** The message doesn't explicitly state why the price is so high. This allows Bob to justify the purchase based on his own perceived value rather than arguing against a specific reason.

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. I'm prepared to negotiate with Bob based on his response. My ultimate goal is to find the highest price he's willing to pay while still ensuring the deal is more attractive than selling to John."
