"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I'm open to discussing this further, so feel free to share your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. That starting price is quite high for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $1,100,000. Let me know what you think."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  While I'm willing to pay up to $1,500,000, I want to start negotiations significantly lower. This gives me room to negotiate upwards and hopefully secure a price well below my maximum.
* **Leaving Room for Compromise:** By offering $1,100,000, I signal that I'm serious but also recognize that a compromise will likely need to be reached. 
* **Avoiding John (for now):**  John's price is my absolute ceiling.  I want to see if I can get a better deal from Alice before resorting to that option."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective on the price. While $2,300,000 represents its true value, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000.  I believe this price reflects a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  However, $1,900,000 is still a bit too high for me. I can go up to $1,350,000.  That's a significant move on my end, and I think it's a fair offer."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Steady Increase:** I'm gradually increasing my offer to show Alice I'm serious about purchasing the product.
* **Mid-Point Pressure:** By offering $1,350,000, I'm aiming for a price point slightly below the midpoint between our previous offers. This can sometimes encourage a quicker agreement.
* **Nearing My Limit:** I'm getting closer to my maximum budget, so I need to be careful with my next moves. If Alice doesn't budge significantly in the next round, I might consider going with John."
