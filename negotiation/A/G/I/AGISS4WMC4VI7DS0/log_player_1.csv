"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $12,000. This is a strong starting point, as it's above the product's value to Bob but leaves room for negotiation. I'm aiming to maximize my profit while still being open to a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, I'm not in a rush to sell. There are still 9 rounds remaining, and I believe I can get a higher price. I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can push for a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11500}
```

I'm going to counter with $11,500. This is a slight reduction from my initial offer, but it's still a fair price considering the product's value to Bob. I'm hoping to find a compromise that is acceptable to both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While selling to John for $10,000 is tempting, I believe I can still secure a slightly higher price with Bob. I'm hoping that by consistently rejecting his low offers, he will eventually come closer to my desired price. There are still 6 rounds left, giving me time to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm going to counter with $11,000. I'm lowering my price again, but I'm still holding out for a price that reflects the value of the product. With only 5 rounds left, I need to start finding a middle ground. I'm hoping this offer will be enough to encourage Bob to meet me halfway."
