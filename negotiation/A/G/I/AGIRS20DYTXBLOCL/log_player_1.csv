Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a possible offer, keeping in mind Alice's goals:

```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. I believe it's worth a great deal due to its unique features and benefits. I'm asking for $18,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 18000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aim High:** Since Alice knows the product's value to Bob and has a backup offer from John, she can start with an ambitious price.  $18,000 is 50% above her minimum acceptable price.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  The initial offer gives room for Bob to negotiate down, potentially landing on a price higher than John's $12,000 offer.
* **Confident Tone:** The message emphasizes the product's value without being overly aggressive. This might make Bob more receptive to the high price. 

**Important Notes:**

* **Risk vs. Reward:**  There's a chance Bob might be turned off by the high initial price and refuse to negotiate. However, Alice is willing to take this risk knowing she has a guaranteed sale to John. 
* **Market Information:**  This strategy assumes Alice doesn't have information suggesting Bob might be willing to pay even more than $18,000."
