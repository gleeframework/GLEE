,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I think $14,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $8,000 for it.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $8,000 is too low, I'm willing to negotiate. How about we meet in the middle at $11,000?",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I believe this product offers significant value beyond $9,000.  To close the gap, I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This is my final offer.",10500.0,Alice,5,

"I'm still interested in the product, but $10,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $9,500 for it.",9500.0,Bob,6,
