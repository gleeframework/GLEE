"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this fantastic product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on something truly unique. As we start our negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $18,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $18,000 is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $8,000. 
* It's worth negotiating to try and get a lower price.
* There are 10 rounds, so you have time to explore a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product, $18,000 is a bit outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $8,000 for it, as that's the maximum value it holds for me.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to compromise. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to lower the price to $14,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the benefits you'll get from owning this product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000

```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $14,000 is still above my maximum budget of $8,000.
* It's worth negotiating further, as we're making progress.
* I'll make a counteroffer and see if we can find a mutually acceptable price."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the compromise, but $14,000 is still too high for me. I'm really only able to spend $8,000 on this product. Let's try to meet in the middle.  If we can't find a price that works for both of us, I might need to explore other options."", ""product_price"": 8000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your position, Bob, and I'm willing to make another concession. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. I'm proposing a price of $12,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice is showing a willingness to compromise, and her offer of $12,000 is getting closer to my budget. 
* However, it's still above my maximum of $8,000.
* I'll counteroffer again, aiming for a price closer to my limit, but recognizing the need to be realistic and potentially make some concessions."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $12,000 is still too much for me. I'm really pushing my limit at $8,000.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to find a compromise, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $10,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm proposing a price of $11,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I hope you can understand that.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

* While we're getting closer, we're running out of rounds (only 3 left).
