(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* $900,000 is a good price, but I'm aiming to save as much money as possible. 
* There are 10 rounds, so I have room to negotiate further. 
* Rejecting the initial offer allows me to gauge Alice's willingness to lower the price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, hoping to get Alice to come down from her initial price.
* This demonstrates my serious intent to purchase the product while also saving a substantial amount.
* I am using a round number for ease of negotiation.
* I still have 9 rounds remaining, so I can adjust my strategy based on Alice's response."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice has shown a willingness to negotiate, but $850,000 is still above my desired price point.
* I have several rounds remaining to try and secure a lower price.
* Rejecting the offer allows me to continue negotiating and potentially get closer to my target price.
* It's too early to buy from John, as I could potentially save a significant amount by continuing negotiations."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 825000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* I'm aiming to meet Alice halfway between her last offer and my previous counteroffer.
* This demonstrates flexibility and a willingness to compromise.
* I'm still aiming for a price below $850,000, but I'm also acknowledging that Alice is unlikely to go much lower than that.
* With several rounds remaining, I still have the flexibility to adjust my strategy if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $835,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $835,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice has shown a willingness to come down in price, and $835,000 is a decent deal, especially considering I have 5 rounds left.
* While I could try for a lower price, it's risky. Alice might not budge further, and I could end up with a worse deal or running out of rounds.
* Accepting this offer secures a significant savings compared to John's price and allows me to use my remaining rounds to potentially find even better deals elsewhere."
