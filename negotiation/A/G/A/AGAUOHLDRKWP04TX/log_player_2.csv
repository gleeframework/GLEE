Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $950000 might be a stretch, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product for $875000. It's a great compromise that still reflects the product's true value, but I'm open to further negotiations.

Alice's offer of $875,000 is a good compromise and within your budget. It's likely you won't get a better price from Alice, and buying from John will cost you more."
