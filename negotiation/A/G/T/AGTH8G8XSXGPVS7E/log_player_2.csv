Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob. I'm willing to give a bit more ground, but I need to stay within my comfort zone. My new offer is $825,000, and I'm hoping we can wrap this up soon.

At $825,000, the deal is good enough.  While I could try to negotiate further, Alice is clearly trying to stay above $800,000.  I'm likely to waste time and rounds for minimal gain at this point. Accepting the offer secures a reasonable price and avoids the risk of the deal falling through."
