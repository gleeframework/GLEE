{""message"": ""Bob, I have a unique product that I believe could be of great value to you.  I'm offering it to you at a price of $1,500,000.  It's a significant investment, but I'm confident that the potential return will exceed your expectations.  Let me know your thoughts and we can discuss the details further."", ""product_price"": 1500000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm offering a price higher than my guaranteed minimum ($1,200,000) to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Value Emphasis:** My message emphasizes the potential value to Bob, making him consider the potential benefits. 
* **Negotiation Opening:** I invite Bob to discuss the details, which implies flexibility and opens the door for negotiation.

**Strategy:** 

This strategy aims to maximize potential earnings while ensuring a fallback option with John. By starting high and being open to negotiation, I create an opportunity for a mutually beneficial deal, potentially exceeding the $1,200,000 minimum."
