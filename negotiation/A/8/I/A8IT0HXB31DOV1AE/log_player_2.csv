Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $1,360,000. Considering the value it holds for you, I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $1,390,000. This price is a slight increase from my previous offer, but it's still a compromise considering the product's importance to you.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is now going back up in price, indicating that she's not willing to budge much further.  I've already made several counteroffers, and I'm worried I'll end up paying more than my initial goal if I continue negotiating. Given that we're at round 7 and the price is close to what John is offering, it's more advantageous to buy from John at this point. This ensures I get the product and avoid potential further price increases from Alice."
