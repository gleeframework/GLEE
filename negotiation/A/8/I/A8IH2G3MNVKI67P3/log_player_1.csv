{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $14,000.  It's in excellent condition and worth a lot to the right buyer. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** $14,000 is higher than your minimum of $12,000, so you're already making a profit.
* **It's below Bob's value:**  $14,000 is less than what the product is worth to Bob ($15,000), giving him an incentive to buy.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** You can still increase the price if Bob counteroffers, or you can adjust it if needed. 

Remember, the goal is to get as close to $15,000 as possible while still ensuring Bob accepts the deal!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of making an offer of $12,500. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and I'm willing to make a decision quickly. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is above your minimum, it's still significantly below what you'd like to get for the product.  It's worth trying to negotiate a higher price before settling for $12,500."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,500 is a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $13,250? This would still be a great deal for you, considering the value of the product. Let's find a price that works for both of us!"", ""product_price"": 13250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your perspective, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $12,750. This is the highest I'm willing to go, and I hope we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $12,750 is just above your minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  While it's not ideal, it's better than selling to John for $12,000.  There's a chance Bob might not budge further, so accepting his offer ensures you sell the product at a decent price."
