"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of making an offer of $12,500. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and I'm willing to make a decision quickly. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",12500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,500 is a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $13,250? This would still be a great deal for you, considering the value of the product. Let's find a price that works for both of us!",13250.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand your perspective, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $12,750. This is the highest I'm willing to go, and I hope we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",12750.0,Bob,4,
