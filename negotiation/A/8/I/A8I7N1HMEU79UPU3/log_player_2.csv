The product is worth $80 to Alice and $100 to you, so you have room to negotiate.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and get a better price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're interested in the product, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $92.50 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $92.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Alice has lowered her price from $95 to $92.50. While this is still more than you'd ideally like to pay, it's a better deal than John's $100.  Accepting the offer saves you $7.50 compared to John."
