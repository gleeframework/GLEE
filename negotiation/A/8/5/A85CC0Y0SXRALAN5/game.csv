"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am currently working within a budget of $1000000. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $1000000?",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $1000000 is significantly below the value of this product. I'm willing to come down to $1250000,  which still allows for a fair profit for me while considering your budget. Let's find a middle ground.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Given my current budget constraints, could we possibly agree on a price closer to $1000000? I believe that would be a fair compromise for both of us.",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but  $1000000 simply doesn't reflect the real value of this product.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1150000.  This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and it's a fair compromise considering your needs. Let's close this deal.",1150000.0,Alice,5,
