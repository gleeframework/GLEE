"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $11,000 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $10,200. What do you think?",10200.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still not comfortable with the price, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession, but I think $10,000 is the lowest I can go. That's the minimum I need to make it worth my while. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,5,
