Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I make it available to anyone else. I believe it will be highly beneficial for you.  Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Alice knows she has a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000. It makes sense to start negotiations with Bob at a price higher than his perceived value. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The offer of $1,100,000 leaves room for Bob to potentially negotiate down, while still securing a significant profit for Alice.
* **Creating Urgency:**  Mentioning that the product will be offered to someone else creates a sense of urgency for Bob to act quickly."
