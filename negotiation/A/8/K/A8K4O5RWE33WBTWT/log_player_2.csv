"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I know it's incredibly valuable to you, and I'm willing to part with it for $1,400,000. This is a limited-time offer, so please let me know your decision soon. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is higher than what the product is worth to her ($1,400,000 vs. $1,200,000).** This means there's room for negotiation.
* **You have a backup option with John at $1,500,000.**  This gives you leverage to try and get a better deal from Alice.
* **Rejecting Alice's offer allows you to explore options for a lower price.** You could counter-offer or wait for a better opportunity."
