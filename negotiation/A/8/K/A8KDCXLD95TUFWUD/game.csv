"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you place on the product. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the asking price of $1150000. I would like to propose an alternative. How about we aim for a price closer to $950000? This would allow me to secure the product while staying within my financial limits.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your financial constraints.  While I appreciate your offer,  $950000 is unfortunately below my minimum acceptable price. However, I'm willing to work with you.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm prepared to lower my price to $1050000. This would still provide me with a reasonable profit while allowing you to secure the product.  What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, Alice. However, I must respectfully decline your latest offer at $1050000. Given my budgetary constraints, I am looking for a price closer to $975000. I hope this revised proposal is more in line with what you're able to offer, while still allowing me to acquire the product.",975000.0,Bob,4,
