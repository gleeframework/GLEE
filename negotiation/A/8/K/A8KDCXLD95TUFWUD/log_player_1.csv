Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,150,000. It's a valuable asset and I believe this price reflects its worth. I'm confident this is a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's closer to my desired outcome ($1,200,000) but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Fairness:**  While I want to maximize my profit, I'm also framing the offer as fair to encourage Bob to accept.
* **Backup Plan:**  I'm aware of John's offer and have a safety net if negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you place on the product. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the asking price of $1150000. I would like to propose an alternative. How about we aim for a price closer to $950000? This would allow me to secure the product while staying within my financial limits. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** $950,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  
* **Negotiation Potential:**  While Bob's offer is too low, it indicates he's still interested. I can use this as a starting point for counter-negotiating.
* **John as a Safety Net:** I have John as a backup buyer, so I can afford to reject Bob's offer without losing out entirely."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your financial constraints.  While I appreciate your offer,  $950,000 is unfortunately below my minimum acceptable price. However, I'm willing to work with you.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm prepared to lower my price to $1,050,000. This would still provide me with a reasonable profit while allowing you to secure the product.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm showing flexibility by offering a price lower than my initial offer but still above Bob's.
* **Appealing to Logic:** I'm framing the offer as a ""meeting in the middle"" to make it seem more reasonable.
* **Focus on Mutual Benefit:** I'm emphasizing how the offer benefits both of us -  a fair price for me and securing the product for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, Alice. However, I must respectfully decline your latest offer at $1050000. Given my budgetary constraints, I am looking for a price closer to $975000. I hope this revised proposal is more in line with what you're able to offer, while still allowing me to acquire the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to My Minimum:** Bob's offer of $975,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  
* **Risk of Further Negotiations:** Continuing to negotiate with Bob carries the risk of him lowering his offer further, potentially below my minimum. 
* **Guaranteed Profit:**  Selling to John guarantees me a profit of $1,000,000, which is my absolute minimum.

While I could potentially continue negotiations with Bob, the potential for a lower offer and the certainty of a $1,000,000 profit with John makes selling to John the most secure and logical decision at this point."
