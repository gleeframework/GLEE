"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested in the product, but $90 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. How about $75? ",75.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking to save a bit, Bob. I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about $82.50 for the product?",82.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $82.50 is still a bit high for me.  I'm happy to pay $80 for it, which is the price I could get it for elsewhere. Let me know if that works for you.",80.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I see you're really trying to get a good deal, Bob! However, I've already told you that I won't go below $82.50. How about we meet at $82.00? It's a fair compromise, and I think you'll find it's worth it.",82.0,Alice,5,
