Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on this product. I know it's something you're interested in, and I think you'll find this price very fair. What do you think about $120?"", 
""product_price"": 120
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's maximum valuation ($150) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $120 leaves space for Bob to counter-offer while still keeping the price significantly above your minimum.
* **Appear Reasonable:**  The message frames the price as ""fair"" to encourage Bob to engage positively.

By aiming high but staying below Bob's maximum price, we increase the chances of a profitable sale while having John as a backup option."
