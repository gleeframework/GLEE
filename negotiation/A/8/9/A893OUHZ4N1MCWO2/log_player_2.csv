# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. As a starting point, I'm willing to offer the product to you for $900,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's worth to you is $800,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. What do you think?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $875,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to both of us. What do you think?

Alice's offer is $75,000 over your maximum budget, but it's a good compromise. You can still save some money and it's likely you won't get a better offer from Alice."
