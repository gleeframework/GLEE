"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this item to you for $115. I believe it's a fair price considering its value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $115 is less than John's price, there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested but $115 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  How about $105? I think that's a fair price considering your value and what I'm willing to spend."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your offer, Bob, but $105 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $110? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has come down from $115 to $110, which is closer to Bob's desired price point.  While he could continue to negotiate, there's a risk Alice might reject further counteroffers and Bob would end up paying more to John.  $110 is a reasonable compromise and saves Bob $10 compared to buying from John."
