Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested but $115 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  How about $105? I think that's a fair price considering your value and what I'm willing to spend. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
