,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. $18,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $15,000.  Let me know if you're willing to work with me on that price.",15000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  While I appreciate your interest, $15,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $16,500. This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair profit for both of us. Let's see if we can find common ground.",16500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  $16,500 is closer, but I'm still a little outside my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $15,500.  Let's try to find a middle ground here.",15500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see we're getting closer.  However, $15,500 still doesn't quite meet my expectations. I'm willing to come down to $16,000.  It's a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's make this happen!",16000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting close. I'm willing to go up to $15,750. This is my final offer.  If we can't agree on this, I'll have to explore other options.",15750.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $15,750 is still a bit below my expectation, but I'm willing to come down to $15,900.  It's a small difference, and I think it reflects the value of the product. Let's close this deal.",15900.0,Alice,7,
