Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. $18,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $15,000.  Let me know if you're willing to work with me on that price.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  While I appreciate your interest, $15,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $16,500.

Round 4

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see we're getting closer.  However, $15,500 still doesn't quite meet my expectations. I'm willing to come down to $16,000.  It's a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 16000}
