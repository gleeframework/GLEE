It's better to try and negotiate a lower price with Alice. $120 is a good starting point, but you can likely get it for less."

You're still trying to save money and $130 is still a bit too high. Let's keep negotiating."

Alice's offer of $135 is a good compromise.  It's better than the $150 from John, and you've managed to negotiate a decent price.  It's worth accepting to avoid further negotiation rounds."
