"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer and I think you'll love it. As we're just starting our conversation, I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. I think this is a great starting point, and I'm open to negotiating further to find a price that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $900,000 is a good starting point, but I want to try to negotiate a lower price. Since I have 10 rounds and the option to buy from John for $1,200,000, I'm in a strong position to bargain."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $900,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this stage.  I'm ready to make a serious offer of $750,000.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap and find a deal that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 750000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your seriousness about the product. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $750,000. I'm willing to compromise and offer you a deal for $850,000. I think this is a fair price considering the value the product will bring to your business. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is moving closer to my desired price, $850,000 is still too high. I have several rounds left and the option to purchase from John. I'm going to try to push for a lower price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still aiming for a price closer to $750,000.  How about we meet in the middle at $800,000? This feels like a fair compromise, and it allows us both to walk away satisfied.  Let's see if we can make this happen."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your desire to meet in the middle, but I'm still not comfortable with $800,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you a deal for $825,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great value for the product. Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $825,000, which is closer to my target price.  While I could try to negotiate further, the risk of her rejecting my counteroffer and potentially pushing the price back up is high.  I've only got 5 rounds left, and buying from John for $1,200,000 is still a possibility.  Accepting Alice's offer ensures I get the product at a good price while saving time and avoiding potential price increases."
