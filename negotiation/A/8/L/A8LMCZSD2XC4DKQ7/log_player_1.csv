"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you a unique and valuable product.  Given its worth, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,500,000. I believe this reflects its true value and the benefits it will bring you."",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's quite a high starting point. I'm interested in the product but  $1,500,000 is not feasible for me.  How about we bring it down to $800,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Bob's offer is significantly below the product's value to both of us. While selling to John is an option, there's still room for negotiation with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $800,000 is significantly below its true value.  To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This reflects the considerable benefits you'll gain from the product."", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

Here's why this counteroffer makes sense:

* **Significantly higher than Bob's offer:** This demonstrates the value of the product and avoids settling too quickly.
* **Still above your minimum:**  You maintain a strong position while showing a willingness to negotiate.
* **Open for further negotiation:** The message leaves room for Bob to counter, keeping the dialogue going."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the product has value, but $1,300,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from our previous offers. Would you consider $1,050,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob is getting very close to our minimum acceptable price, and we are past the halfway point in the negotiation. Accepting this offer secures a profit above our guaranteed sale to John."
