Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for sale at a special price of $125. I think it would be very valuable to you, but I'm trying to move it quickly.  What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 125
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations a bit higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer. 
* **Finding a Middle Ground:** Offering the product at $125 splits the difference between your minimum ($150) and Bob's perceived value ($100). This gives Bob a potential ""deal"" while still earning you a profit.
* **Urgency and Justification:** By mentioning a ""special price"" and wanting to move the product quickly, you create a sense of urgency without revealing your guaranteed sale to John.

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counter-offers. You have some leeway to go down in price while still earning more than selling to John."
