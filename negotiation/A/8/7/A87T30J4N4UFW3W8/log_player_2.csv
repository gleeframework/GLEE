"Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $9,500 is a better price than Alice's initial asking price, it's still above your maximum budget of $8,000. You should reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price.  You can always buy from John for $8,000 as a fallback option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant step closer to your desired price point of $8,000. It demonstrates a willingness to negotiate while still leaving room for some potential compromise. This offer is likely to be accepted by Alice, as she values the product at $10,000."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $9,000 is closer to your budget, you can still do better. You know John is willing to sell for $8,000, so you have a clear benchmark. Rejecting this offer allows you to continue negotiating with Alice and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8750}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a compromise. It's higher than your desired price of $8,000 but lower than Alice's last offer of $9,000. It shows you're willing to meet halfway and potentially secure a deal closer to your budget. It's also a reasonable price for Alice considering her product's value of $10,000."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $8,900 is close to your budget but still slightly higher than what you're willing to pay. You know that John is offering the product for $8,000, which is the best deal available.  It's not worth continuing to negotiate with Alice when you can secure the product for a lower price from John."
