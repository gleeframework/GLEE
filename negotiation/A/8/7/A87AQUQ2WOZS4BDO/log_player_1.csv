Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", 
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  My goal is to get as close to $120 as possible, as that's my guaranteed profit from John.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** While $119 is my initial offer, there's a slight chance Bob might counter-offer, giving me a small buffer to still get more than $120.
* **Avoid Appearing Greedy:** Starting too high (e.g., $119.99) might discourage Bob immediately. This offer balances profit with the chance of a successful sale."
