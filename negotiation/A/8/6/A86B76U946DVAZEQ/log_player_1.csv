Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. I believe the product has some value, but I'm not convinced it's worth the full $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to see if we can find a mutually beneficial price. Can you consider my counteroffer of $750,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
