"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $160 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $140, which is closer to my budget. It's still a good deal for you, considering you valued the product at $150.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",140.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, and I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm thinking of a price of $145. This is as low as I can go, but I'm still willing to make a deal. What do you think?",145.0,Alice,5,
