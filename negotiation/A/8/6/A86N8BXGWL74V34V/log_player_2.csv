"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. I think this is a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:** It's above the $8,000 value to Alice and leaves room for negotiation.
* **John's offer is the fallback:**  If negotiations fail, Bob has a guaranteed alternative for $10,000. 
* **Counteroffers are likely to be beneficial:**  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a better price from Alice."

{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested, $9,500 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product, which is still a good deal for you.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $9,000. This still gives you a good deal, and it's closer to what I'm hoping to get for the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement!

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is closer to Bob's ideal price:**  $9,000 is closer to Bob's target price of $8,500, and a better deal than buying from John.
* **Negotiation risk:**  Continuing to negotiate could result in Alice becoming less flexible or even rejecting further offers.  
* **Avoiding John's higher price:**  Accepting Alice's offer saves Bob $1,000 compared to buying from John."
