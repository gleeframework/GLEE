"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900,000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm only making it to you because I think you're the right person for this product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000.

Alice's offer is still too high. You can save $100,000 by buying from John for $1,000,000. There's a chance Alice might make a better offer if you reject this one."
