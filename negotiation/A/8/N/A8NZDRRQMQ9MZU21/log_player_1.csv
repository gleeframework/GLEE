Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm asking for $15,000. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium.
* **Strategic Starting Point:**  $15,000 is a significant markup but still within a potentially reasonable range for Bob if the product is worth $10,000 to him. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** This initial offer leaves room for negotiation if Bob counters. I can always come down in price, but I can't go up from my initial offer. 

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes I don't have significant time constraints. If I need to sell quickly, I might lower the asking price to ensure a faster sale."
