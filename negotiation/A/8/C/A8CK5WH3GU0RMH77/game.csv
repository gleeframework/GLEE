"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think you'll find it's a great investment opportunity. I'm willing to start with an offer of $20,000. What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $20,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm very interested in the product, but my budget is more in the range of $8,000. Would you be willing to consider that?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your honest feedback, Bob. I understand that $20,000 is a bit high for you. However, I need to make a profit, so I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $16,000. Is that something you'd be interested in?",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $16,000 is still a bit outside my range.  I'm prepared to pay up to $10,000 for this product. Would you consider that?",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers, so I'll offer the product to you for $13,000. Is that something you'd consider?",13000.0,Alice,5,
