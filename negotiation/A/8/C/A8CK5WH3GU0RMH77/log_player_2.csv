"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think you'll find it's a great investment opportunity. I'm willing to start with an offer of $20,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $20,000 is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $8,000.  It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice to see if you can get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $20,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm very interested in the product, but my budget is more in the range of $8,000. Would you be willing to consider that?"", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your honest feedback, Bob. I understand that $20,000 is a bit high for you. However, I need to make a profit, so I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $16,000. Is that something you'd be interested in? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's new offer of $16,000 is better than her initial offer, it's still above my maximum budget of $8,000. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further, aiming for a price closer to my budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $16,000 is still a bit outside my range.  I'm prepared to pay up to $10,000 for this product. Would you consider that?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers, so I'll offer the product to you for $13,000. Is that something you'd consider? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $13,000 is still above my maximum budget of $8,000.  While we've been negotiating, I've realized that it's unlikely we'll be able to reach a price I'm comfortable with. It's better for me to take the guaranteed deal with John at $8,000.  This ensures I get the product within my budget."
