"Alice's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice.  $600,000 is a good deal, but there's potential to get it for even less."

I'm starting with a significantly lower offer than Alice's initial price. This is a bold move, but it shows I'm serious about negotiating and potentially getting a great deal.  We'll see if Alice is willing to budge."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $500,000

Alice is coming down in price, so we're making progress. However, $500,000 is still a bit high. I'm going to try one more counteroffer to see if I can get it closer to my ideal price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

I'm raising my offer slightly to $450,000.  This shows I'm willing to compromise, but I still believe there's room for further negotiation. Hopefully, Alice will see this as a reasonable counteroffer and we can finalize the deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $475,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $475,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

At this point, I'm getting close to my ideal price. While I could continue to negotiate, there's a risk that Alice will get frustrated and refuse to budge further. Accepting this offer secures the product at a price significantly lower than John's, and it's a good compromise."
