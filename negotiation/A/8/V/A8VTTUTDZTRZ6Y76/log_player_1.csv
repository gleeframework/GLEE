Bob's offer:

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $9,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'd like to propose $5,500. Would you be willing to consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $5,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $5,500

Bob is unlikely to significantly increase his offer. Accepting his current offer would be a substantial loss compared to John's guaranteed price. It's time to move on to the guaranteed sale."
