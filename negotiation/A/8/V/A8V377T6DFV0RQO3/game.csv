"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's worth to me. What are your thoughts on this counteroffer?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the value, however, the price you're suggesting doesn't quite reflect the product's true worth. I could consider letting it go for $1,350,000.  This feels like a fair compromise.  What do you think?",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $1,350,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,275,000. What are your thoughts on this revised counteroffer?",1275000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  While $1,275,000 is closer to what you're looking for, I'm still aiming for a price that reflects the product's full value. My final offer is $1,300,000.  This is a very competitive price and a strong indication of my desire to do business with you. Let me know your thoughts.",1300000.0,Alice,5,
