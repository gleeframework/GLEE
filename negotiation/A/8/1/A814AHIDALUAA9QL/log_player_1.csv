"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a good profit. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's a significant discount from Bob's perceived value, but it still gives you a good profit. It also leaves room for negotiation, which is important in a multi-round scenario."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,000 is better than selling to John, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $8,000.  I want to try and push for a higher price.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go that low.  I'm willing to come down to $10,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to make a decent profit.  Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'll offer $9,500. This is the best I can do, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,500 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get closer to my initial offer of $12,000. I'll make another counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  How about we meet at $10,500? It's a compromise, and it allows me to make a profit while still giving you a good deal.  Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but $10,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'll offer $10,250. This is the best I can do, and I hope we can finally come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While it's still a bit below my initial asking price, it's getting closer to my minimum.  Given the limited number of rounds remaining, it's likely that I won't be able to get a higher price.  $10,250 is better than selling to John for $8,000."
