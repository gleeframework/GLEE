"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I acknowledge the market value, I believe the potential benefits you'll gain from this product justify a slightly higher price. I'm willing to come down to $1650000. This price reflects the value I know this product will bring to your business, and I'm confident it's a fair compromise.  Let's work together to finalize this deal.",1650000.0,Alice,3,
