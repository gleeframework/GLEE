Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your offer. While I appreciate your interest, $8,000 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need something closer to my asking price. How about $10,500? It's still a great deal for you, considering its value to you.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,250 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway on our last offers. How about $10,000? It's a fair price for both of us, considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000.

**Reasoning:** Alice has agreed to sell at $10,000, which is the same price John offers. There's no point in further negotiation or risking a worse deal.  It's time to accept and secure the product."
