"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, $140 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $125 for it, which is a fair price considering my maximum budget.  Let me know what you think.",125.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your prompt response, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to meet within your budget. In light of this, I am willing to consider your offer. However, I must respectfully decline to lower the price below $140. Therefore, I am proposing a final offer of $135 for the product. I hope this meets within the parameters of your budget and allows us to move forward with this transaction.",135.0,Alice,3,
