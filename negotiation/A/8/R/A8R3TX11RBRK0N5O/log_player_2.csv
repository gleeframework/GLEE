# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a great opportunity to get a fantastic deal, and I'm confident you'll love the product.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $12,000 is a good deal, Bob can likely do better.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to counteroffer and potentially get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested, $12,000 is a bit higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11,500. This is a great compromise, and I'm confident you'll love the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible.  $11,500 is closer to his ideal price, but he can still potentially get a better deal.  Rejecting allows him to counteroffer and see if he can get closer to his goal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $11,500 is still a little higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $11,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to go below $11,750. This is the lowest price I'm comfortable with, and I think it's a fair compromise considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob has been trying to get the product for a price closer to $10,000, but Alice is insistent on a price closer to $11,500.  While Bob could continue negotiating, it seems like there is a gap that they may not be able to bridge easily.  At this point, it's more advantageous for Bob to buy from John for $10,000.  This guarantees him the product at a price he is happy with, saving him time and potential frustration in further negotiation."
