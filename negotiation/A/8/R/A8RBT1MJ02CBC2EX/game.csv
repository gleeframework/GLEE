"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it has immense value and I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000.

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I acknowledge the value of the product, $1,200,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for it. This is a fair price considering your own valuation and the potential savings for both of us. Let's work together to reach an agreement.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1,050,000 is a significant discount, but I still need to make a profit. Considering the product's worth to you is $1,500,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $1,225,000. This is a compromise that I believe is fair for both of us.",1225000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,225,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,100,000, which would give you a good profit and allow me to stay within my budget. I'm confident we can find a solution that benefits both of us.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your persistence, Bob. I understand that $1,100,000 is a significant amount, but I'm willing to make one more concession.
