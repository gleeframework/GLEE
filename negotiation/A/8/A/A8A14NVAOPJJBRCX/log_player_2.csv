"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset.  This product is worth a significant amount to you, and I'm confident it will be a wise investment.  My asking price is $1,200,000.  This is a fair price that allows both of us to benefit from this transaction.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is $1,200,000.** This is significantly lower than the $1,500,000 you would pay to John.
* **Your goal is to save as much money as possible.** Accepting Alice's offer means you save $300,000. 

While the product may be worth more to you, it's still a good deal to accept Alice's offer and save money."
