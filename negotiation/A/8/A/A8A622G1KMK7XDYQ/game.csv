"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product is valuable, $1,500,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $1,000,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is significantly below its true value.  How about we meet in the middle? I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but that's still a bit high for my budget. How about $1,100,000?  That's a fair offer.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm trying to be reasonable here.  While $1,100,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I can't accept anything less than $1,250,000.  This is my final offer.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
