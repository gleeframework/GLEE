Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll start by making an offer to Bob. Since the product is worth at least $100 to me, I'll offer it to Bob at a price that is slightly higher than what it's worth to him. Let's say I'll offer it to him for $90.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","Bob rejected my initial offer, and now he's making a counteroffer of $85. Since this is lower than my initial offer, I'll reject his offer and proceed to the next round. I'll send a counteroffer that's higher than his offer but still lower than my minimum price of $100.

Let's say I'll offer it to him for $87.

At this point, I've already offered the product to him for $90, and he's not willing to meet me at that price. I've also rejected several of his offers, and I'm not sure if he's willing to go any higher. Considering my minimum price is $100, I think it's time to reconsider selling to Bob. I'll choose option 3 and sell the product to John for $100.
