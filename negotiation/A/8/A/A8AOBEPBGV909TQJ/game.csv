"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your position, but that price is significantly below the product's true value. How about we meet in the middle at $1,275,000?",1275000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  To be frank, $1,150,000 is cutting it too close to my bottom line.  I could consider a final offer of $1,225,000. This offer takes into account the value this product brings and represents my final offer.",1225000.0,Alice,5,
