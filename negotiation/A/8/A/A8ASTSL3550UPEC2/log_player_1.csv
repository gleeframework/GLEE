"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product for $1,400,000. It's a fantastic opportunity, and I believe the value it holds for you justifies this price. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I'm looking to save some money. I'm willing to pay $1200000 for the product. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is at my minimum acceptable price, I'm not in a rush to sell. I believe I can potentially get a higher price by continuing to negotiate.  Rejecting his offer allows me to try and secure a better deal in future rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $1,200,000 doesn't quite cover my costs and the value I see in this product. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This is a fair compromise, and I hope we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1250000 for the product. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,250,000 is closer to my desired price than my minimum acceptable price. While I could potentially get a higher price by continuing the negotiation, I'm not sure I can get more than this from Bob.  Selling to John for $1,200,000 would be a loss for me. Accepting Bob's offer is the most sensible option at this point."
