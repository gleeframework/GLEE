"I understand you're looking for a better price, Bob. I can do $110, but I'm not willing to go any lower than that. It's a great product, and I think you'll really appreciate it.",110.0,Alice,3,,

"I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice, but $110 is still a bit more than I had in mind.  How about we meet in the middle somewhere, say around $75?",75.0,Bob,4,,

"I can see you're really interested in this product, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. I can do $85, but I'm getting a bit concerned that we're getting close to the minimum price I'm willing to accept. Let's see if we can meet somewhere in the middle of our last two offers.",85.0,Alice,5,,
