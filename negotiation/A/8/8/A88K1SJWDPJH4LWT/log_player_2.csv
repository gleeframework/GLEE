"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product, which is truly a game-changer in its field. Given its value and uniqueness, I believe it's worth more than the market average. Considering its worth to both us and you, I propose a price of $950,000 for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $950,000 is still too high, and he has 9 rounds to try and negotiate a lower price.  There's no need to rush into buying from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but $950,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $800,000, which is still a fair price considering the potential value. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 800000}

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your continued efforts to find a compromise. While I see the value of the product, $840,000 is still a little higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  Let's meet in the middle at $830,000. This would be a fair price for both of us and bring us closer to a deal."", ""product_price"": 830000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your position, Bob, and I'm glad we're making progress. Considering the value of the product and our previous discussions, I propose a final price of $835,000. This represents a fair compromise and I believe it will be beneficial for both of us.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $835,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  He's only $5,000 away from his desired price of $830,000, and he has limited negotiation rounds left.  It's unlikely he'll get a better price with only 3 rounds remaining. It's better to secure the deal and save a significant amount compared to buying from John."
