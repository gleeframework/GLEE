Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $80 is a little too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $90?  It's still a great deal for you, and it's closer to what I need.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob,  $85 is closer, but I'm still hoping to get a bit more. How about $90?  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'd rather sell it to you than anyone else. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Alice is clearly holding firm at $90.  While you *might* be able to get it lower, there's a risk she'll dig in or you'll waste valuable rounds. Accepting at $90 guarantees you get the product at a discount from John's price."
