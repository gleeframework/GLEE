"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,300,000. I'm interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. I'm willing to negotiate further to find a mutually beneficial price.",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  I understand your position, but $1,300,000 is significantly below its true value. How about we meet in the middle at $1,600,000?  This recognizes its worth while still offering you a fair deal.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $1,600,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,450,000, but that's as high as I can go. I'm hoping we can find a deal that works for both of us.",1450000.0,Bob,4,
