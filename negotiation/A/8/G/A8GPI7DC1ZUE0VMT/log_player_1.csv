Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,900,000. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial arrangement."", ""product_price"": 1900000}"

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,300,000. I'm interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. I'm willing to negotiate further to find a mutually beneficial price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  I understand your position, but $1,300,000 is significantly below its true value. How about we meet in the middle at $1,600,000?  This recognizes its worth while still offering you a fair deal."", ""product_price"": 1600000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $1,600,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,450,000, but that's as high as I can go. I'm hoping we can find a deal that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000.

While Bob is getting closer to a reasonable price, it's clear he's unlikely to meet my minimum. John offers a guaranteed $1,500,000, which is preferable to the risk of continuing negotiations with Bob and potentially ending up with even less."
