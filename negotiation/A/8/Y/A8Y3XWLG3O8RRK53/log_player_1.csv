{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value.  It leaves room for negotiation, but it also establishes a clear starting point. It's important to remember that while I want to maximize profit, I also want to keep Bob engaged in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,000. I really like the product, but I have to be mindful of my budget. Can you meet me at $8,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $8,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. I'm confident I can get a better deal with Bob or John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $8,000 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $9,500? This is still a great value for you, and I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

My counteroffer to Bob reflects a compromise. It's lower than my initial offer, but still above my minimum acceptable price. By offering $9,500, I'm showing willingness to negotiate while ensuring I get a reasonable return on my product.  This counteroffer keeps the negotiation moving forward and hopefully leads to a successful outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but $9,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $9,000? I'm really interested in the product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I would have preferred to get closer to my initial asking price, $9,000 is still a good deal for me.  It's above my minimum acceptable price of $10,000, and it's likely that further negotiation with Bob would be difficult and time-consuming.  

Selling to John for $10,000 is a safe option, but accepting Bob's offer allows me to secure a sale with a potential buyer who might be interested in future transactions."
