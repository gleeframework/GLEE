"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm starting high, aiming for a significant profit. This will give me a strong starting point in the negotiation and allow for potential concessions later on.  If Bob rejects, I can then gauge his interest and adjust accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, I'm not willing to settle just yet. I believe there's still room for negotiation, and I'm hoping to get closer to my desired price.  I'll counter with a higher offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly from the initial offer, showing a willingness to compromise. However, I'm still aiming for a substantial profit and believe $900,000 is a fair price considering the product's worth to me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting lower, but I'm still not willing to accept it. I'm confident I can get a better price. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round, but if it's rejected, I'll seriously consider selling to John.  I'm not willing to go much lower than $800,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

I'm getting closer to my minimum acceptable price.  This offer shows a significant compromise, but I'm still hoping to close the deal with Bob. If he rejects this offer, I'll likely consider selling to John in the next round."

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting increasingly lower, and I'm not willing to go that low. I've made significant concessions already, and I'm confident that John's offer is a more reasonable outcome. It's time to close the deal with John and secure a profitable sale."
