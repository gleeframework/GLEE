"Hello Bob, it's a pleasure to connect with you. I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential, I believe a price of $2,000,000 is a fair starting point for our discussion.  What are your initial thoughts?",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your offer is a bit too high for my budget. Considering the value I see in this product, I'm willing to pay $1,300,000. Let's see if we can find common ground there.",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,300,000 undervalues the true potential of this product.  I'm confident that it can generate significantly more value for you.  Let's meet in the middle â€“ how about $1,800,000?",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective on the product's potential, but $1,800,000 is still beyond my budget. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to pay $1,450,000. This would be a fair price for both of us, and allows us to move forward.",1450000.0,Bob,4,
