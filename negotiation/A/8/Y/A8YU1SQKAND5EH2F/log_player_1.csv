Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer is a bit too high for my budget. Considering the value I see in this product, I'm willing to pay $1,300,000. Let's see if we can find common ground there. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,300,000 undervalues the true potential of this product.  I'm confident that it can generate significantly more value for you.  Let's meet in the middle â€“ how about $1,800,000?"",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your perspective on the product's potential, but $1,800,000 is still beyond my budget. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to pay $1,450,000. This would be a fair price for both of us, and allows us to move forward. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,450,000

""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  While Bob is slowly increasing his offer, we are still below John's offer of $1,500,000. It's unlikely Bob will reach that amount quickly enough to warrant continuing the negotiation. Taking the guaranteed $1,500,000 from John is the most profitable decision at this point."
