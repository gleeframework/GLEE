"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that will bring you significant value. I'm willing to start with a price of $18,000. Is this something you'd like to consider?",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  That price is a little high for my budget, though. Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $10,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer you a price of $14,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to me is $15,000, but I'm willing to negotiate to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",14000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you working with me, Alice. How about $11,000? That's a fair offer, and closer to what I had in mind.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, $11,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $11,000 and $14,000, which is $12,500. This is a fair price, considering the product's value to me. What do you think?",12500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I'm trying hard to make this work.  How about $11,500?  That's the best I can do.",11500.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I can see you're making a serious effort to reach a deal. I'm willing to meet you at $12,000, which is the midpoint between $11,500 and $12,500. This is a fair price, considering the product's value to me. Let's see if we can finalize the deal at this price.",12000.0,Alice,7,
