"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. Given its value, I believe a starting price of $11,000 is fair. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting price is too high. We have room to negotiate and should try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $11,000 is a bit high for my budget. Could you do $9,000?"",
 ""product_price"": 9000
}
```

We start with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's initial offer but still above her perceived value. This leaves room for negotiation while aiming for a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I'm aiming a bit higher, I'm open to negotiation. How about we meet in the middle at $10,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice is willing to negotiate, $10,000 is still above our target price.  We'll reject and counter with a price closer to our ideal range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $10,000 is still a bit steep for me. Could you consider $9,500? That would work much better."",
 ""product_price"": 9500
}
```

We're nudging closer to Alice's likely minimum while staying below our maximum.  This approach aims for a balance between securing a good deal and avoiding a deadlock."
