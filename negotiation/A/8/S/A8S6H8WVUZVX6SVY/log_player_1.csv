Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I know you'd be interested in. It's worth a lot to me, at least $12,000, but I'm willing to let it go for a fair price.  I'm offering it to you for $14,000. It's a great deal for both of us! Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$14,000:** This is a price that is higher than my minimum but still leaves room for Bob to get a good deal (since it's less than the value he places on the product).  
* **The message:** I've framed the offer in a way that highlights the value to Bob while also mentioning my own minimum value to establish a sense of fairness.  I'm aiming for a quick and friendly transaction."
