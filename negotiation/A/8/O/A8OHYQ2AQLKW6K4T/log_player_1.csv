"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high price, $14,000, knowing Bob values the product at $15,000. This gives us room to negotiate while still aiming for a good profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I believe I can get a better price. While $12,500 is more than my minimum acceptable price,  I'm still aiming for a higher profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
``` 

I'm counteroffering with $13,500.  This is a compromise, lowering my initial offer but still above Bob's counteroffer.  I want to see if he'll meet me in the middle."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm still rejecting Bob's offer.  $12,000 is getting closer to my minimum, but I'm not convinced I can't get more. I'm going to try one more counteroffer before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12800}
``` 

This time, I'm lowering my price to $12,800.  It's a significant drop, but I'm trying to find a middle ground while still getting a decent profit. If Bob rejects this, I might need to consider John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

With Bob consistently lowering his offer, it's clear he's not willing to meet my desired price. We're nearing my minimum, but there's a risk of him rejecting my next counteroffer and potentially going even lower.  To secure a guaranteed profit, it's time to sell to John."
