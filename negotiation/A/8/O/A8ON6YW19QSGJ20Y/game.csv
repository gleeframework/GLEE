"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think your initial price is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,400,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget.",1400000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,400,000 is a respectable offer, the true value of this product to your business operations is significant. I'm willing to come down to $1,650,000. I believe this price reflects a fair compromise and allows us both to benefit.",1650000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,650,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $1,550,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget. I'm getting close to considering other options, but I still want to work with you.",1550000.0,Bob,4,
