Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This gives me some room to negotiate if Bob counters, but it's also a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. I'm hoping Bob is interested and we can come to a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $12,000 is better than my minimum of $10,000, I believe I can still get a better price.  I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer to see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm counteroffering at $13,500. This is halfway between my initial offer of $15,000 and Bob's offer of $12,000.  Hopefully, this shows I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm still confident in the value of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $11,500 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a bit more. I'll try one more counteroffer to see if we can reach a deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

This is my final counteroffer. It's a little closer to Bob's offer, but still reflects the value I place on the product. If Bob rejects this, I'm prepared to sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000

```

Bob is not budging much, and I've already made several counteroffers. It seems like we're not going to reach a deal.  It's time to cut my losses and sell to John for $10,000. It's not my ideal price, but it's still better than risking a continued stalemate with Bob."
