"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. I think you'll really love it, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900,000. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer!  I appreciate you coming down from your asking price. However, I'm looking to invest in this product for a specific project, and $900,000 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider $800,000?  I'm confident that we can find a deal that works for both of us.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $800,000 is a bit tight for you, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $850,000. I believe the product's value to you will far outweigh the investment, and I'm confident we can meet in the middle. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  While I'm interested in this product, $850,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  How about we split the difference and settle on $825,000?  I believe this would be a fair price for both of us.",825000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to split the difference, but I'm not willing to go as low as $825,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think $875,000 is a more reasonable price for this product. It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment. What do you think?",875000.0,Alice,5,
