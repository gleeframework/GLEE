"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that I think you'd really like. It's worth $100 to you, right? I'm offering it to you for $120. That's a fair price, and it's less than what I'd get from someone else. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You know you can get the product for $100 from John, so Alice's offer of $120 is not a good deal.  You should reject the offer and buy from John."
