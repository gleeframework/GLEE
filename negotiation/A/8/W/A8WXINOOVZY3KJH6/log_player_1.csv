``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $140. This is a fair price considering it's worth $150 to him and still allows me to make a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 

While I would prefer a higher price, Bob's offer of $130 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $120. Accepting his offer ensures a sale and guarantees a profit."
