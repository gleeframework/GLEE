"Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

Since your maximum budget is $10,000 and Alice is offering the product at that price, there's no incentive to negotiate.  It's better to buy from John immediately as you're guaranteed to get the product within your budget."
