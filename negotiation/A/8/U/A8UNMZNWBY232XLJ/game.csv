"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you reaching out. I'm interested in the product, but $100 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay right now. I'd be happy to pay $85 for it. What do you think?",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  While I appreciate your offer, $85 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $95.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I believe you'll find the product worth every penny.",95.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you being flexible.  $95 is closer, but I'm still hoping we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $90?  I'm confident this product will be a great value at that price.",90.0,Bob,4,
