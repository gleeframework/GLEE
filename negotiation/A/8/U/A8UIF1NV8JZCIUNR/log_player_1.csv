Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you first. I think it would be really valuable to you. I'm asking for $150. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always best to start negotiations a bit higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Gauging Interest:** By starting at $150, we can see how interested Bob is. If he accepts immediately, we've made a great deal. If he rejects or counter-offers, we can adjust accordingly, knowing our fallback is $120 from John. 
* **Justification:**  The message lightly justifies the price by mentioning the product's value to Bob, making it seem less arbitrary."
