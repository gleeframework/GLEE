I'm going to try and get a little closer to my desired price.  I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can negotiate a higher price in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $110, which is still a fair price for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}

Round 4
Bob's offer:

I'll accept Bob's offer. While it's still lower than I initially hoped, it's getting closer to my minimum acceptable price and I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely."
