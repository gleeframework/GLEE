"Alice's offer: The product price will be $175. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $175
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

The product is worth $100 to Bob, and Alice is offering it for $175.  This is way above Bob's budget. He should reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

Bob is willing to pay the maximum of $100 for the product. This is the price he would pay John for the same item, so it's his absolute limit.  This counteroffer makes it clear that he is serious about getting the product but won't go higher."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $125 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, it's still above Bob's $100 limit.  He should continue negotiating to try and get the price down further. There's a chance Alice might be willing to go lower, especially since she already rejected Bob's counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

Bob is trying to meet Alice halfway, offering $110, which is a compromise between his maximum price and Alice's latest offer. This shows he's willing to negotiate but still wants a better deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice is now offering $130, which is still above Bob's maximum price of $100.  He's already made multiple counteroffers and hasn't been successful in getting Alice to lower her price further. At this point, it's more advantageous for Bob to just buy the product from John for $100 and avoid any further negotiation with Alice."
