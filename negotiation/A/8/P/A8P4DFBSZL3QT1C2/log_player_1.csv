"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable value ($8,000). This gives me room to negotiate downwards if needed. 
* **Confidence and Value:** I'm framing the offer as a ""great deal"" to emphasize the product's worth and encourage Bob to consider it seriously. 
* **Open to Discussion:**  I'm ending with a question to open a dialogue and gauge Bob's initial reaction. 

This strategy aims to establish a high starting point for the negotiation while leaving room for flexibility depending on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $10000 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $7500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Rejecting the offer:**  While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired value.  I believe I can get a better price by continuing to negotiate.
* **Seeking a better price:** I want to explore if I can bridge the gap between Bob's offer and my desired price. I'm confident I can secure a higher value through further negotiation.
* **Maintaining leverage:**  By rejecting Bob's offer, I'm demonstrating my commitment to getting the best price for my product. This can put pressure on Bob to increase his offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. However, $7,500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $8,500, which is a significant reduction from my initial offer. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Acknowledging Bob's position:** I'm acknowledging Bob's budget concerns to show I'm listening and willing to compromise. 
* **Offering a reasonable counter:**  I'm proposing a price that's halfway between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. This shows I'm flexible but not desperate.
* **Highlighting the value:**  I'm reminding Bob that I'm still offering a significant reduction from my initial price, implying the value of the product justifies this price.
* **Seeking a decision:**  I'm ending with a clear question to encourage Bob to respond quickly and hopefully move towards a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $8500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Would you be willing to consider a price of $7200? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Still above minimum:** While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired price.  
* **Seeking a better price:** I'm not yet ready to settle for $7,200. I believe I can push for a price closer to $8,000, especially with the option of selling to John as a backup. 
* **Maintaining leverage:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I'm maintaining my bargaining power and demonstrating my commitment to getting a fair price.  

**Next Steps:**

In the next round, I'll make a counteroffer that's closer to my desired price, possibly around $8,000 or slightly higher. This will keep the negotiation moving towards a mutually acceptable outcome."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us.  I'm willing to go down to $8,000 for the product. This is a significant reduction from my previous offers, and it's very close to my minimum acceptable price.  If you're serious about getting this product, I encourage you to consider this offer."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Emphasizing compromise:** I acknowledge Bob's desire for a good deal and reiterate my willingness to negotiate.
* **Reaching a reasonable price:** I'm proposing $8,000, which is my minimum acceptable price. This shows I'm serious about closing the deal while still protecting my interests.
* **Highlighting the value:** I emphasize the significant reduction from previous offers to reinforce the value of the product. 
* **Encouraging action:** I urge Bob to consider the offer seriously to move closer to a deal.
