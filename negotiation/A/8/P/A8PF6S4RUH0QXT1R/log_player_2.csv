Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I like the spirit of compromise, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $90. I'm willing to go a bit higher, to $120, and see if we can meet in the middle from there.

It's time to cut your losses. Alice is unlikely to come down to a price that works for you. You've already gotten her down to $120, but that's still significantly more than John's offer.  Buying from John guarantees you get the product at your target price."
