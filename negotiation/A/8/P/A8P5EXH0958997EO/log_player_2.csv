{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Since the product is worth $120 to me, and Alice is offering it for $110, I can try to negotiate a better price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $110 is a bit steep for me. How about $105? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about we settle on $108? I think it's a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $108

I'm still hoping to get the price down a little further.  I'm willing to keep negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $108 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'm prepared to pay $106, which I think is a fair price for both of us.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 106}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob. I'm willing to shave off a bit more, but I need to make a profit. How about we meet at $109? I think that's a sweet spot for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $109. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $109
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer to pay $106, Alice is offering $109. I'm getting closer to my target price, and I'm not sure if I can get a better deal with Alice or if John will still be available if I reject. It's a bit risky, but accepting Alice's offer seems like the best option at this point."
