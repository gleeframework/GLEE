"I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about we settle on $108? I think it's a fair price for both of us.",108.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $108 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'm prepared to pay $106, which I think is a fair price for both of us.  What do you say?",106.0,Bob,4,

"I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob. I'm willing to shave off a bit more, but I need to make a profit. How about we meet at $109? I think that's a sweet spot for both of us.",109.0,Alice,5,
