"Bob, it's a pleasure to connect with you. I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,800,000. I believe this reflects its true worth, and I'm open to discussing this further.",1800000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, while I appreciate the opportunity, your initial offer is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product, considering its value and potential. I believe this price reflects a fair deal for both of us.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you countering. I see the value you place in this product, but $1,200,000 is a significant drop from my initial asking price. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,500,000?",1500000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,500,000 is still outside my comfortable range.  I'm willing to go up to $1,300,000.  This is a significant increase from my previous offer and demonstrates my commitment to making a deal.  Let's try to find common ground.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. It seems like we're getting closer. How about we settle this at $1,425,000?  That's a substantial profit for both of us.",1425000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting closer, but I'm still not quite there.  I'm willing to go up to $1,350,000, which is a significant compromise on my end. This reflects the value I see in the product, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.",1350000.0,Bob,6,
