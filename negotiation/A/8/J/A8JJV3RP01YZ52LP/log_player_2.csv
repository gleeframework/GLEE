"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While $12,000 is less than your maximum budget, it's still significantly higher than Alice's valuation of the product. There's room for negotiation to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. Could you do it for $9,000?"",
""product_price"": 9000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** This counter-offer aims to significantly lower the price while still leaving room for further negotiation. It also positions the offer as still being potentially attractive to Alice, as it's considerably higher than her valuation of $8,000."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $9,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $10,500?  This is a fair price considering the value it holds for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice is moving towards a more reasonable price, but there's still room for negotiation. By rejecting this offer, we signal that we're looking for a price closer to our initial counter-offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  How about we split the difference and settle at $9,750?"",
""product_price"": 9750
}
```

**Reasoning:** 

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  This offer splits the difference between the previous two offers ($10,500 and $9,000).  This strategy often feels fair to both parties and can help reach a faster agreement.
* **Staying Below Budget:** $9,750 keeps you well below your $15,000 maximum and leaves some wiggle room for a potential final counter-offer from Alice. 
* **Above Alice's Valuation:** This offer is still a significant profit for Alice (over her $8,000 valuation), making it likely she'll consider it seriously."
