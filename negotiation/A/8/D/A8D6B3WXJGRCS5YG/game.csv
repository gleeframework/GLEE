,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective on the price. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $9000 is just too low for me. How about $12000? That's a significant discount from my original offer and still gives you a great deal on this product.",12000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $12000 is still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to pay $8000 for the product. I'm trying to be reasonable, but I really need to save some money on this purchase.",8000.0,Bob,4,
