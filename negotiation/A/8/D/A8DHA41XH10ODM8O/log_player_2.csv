"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this unique product at a price of $12,000. I think it's a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $15,000. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob can do better than $12,000.  He values the product at $15,000, and Alice only wants $8,000. There's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I'm looking to pay closer to $10,000. This product is valuable to me, but I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to pay closer to $10,000, but I'm still a bit above my minimum. How about we meet in the middle at $11,500? It's a fair price that should work for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value:** Bob values the product at $15,000, so a price of $11,500 is still a good deal for him.
* **Negotiation:** While he could try to negotiate further, there's a risk Alice might walk away.
* **Opportunity Cost:** Buying from John would cost $15,000, so accepting Alice's offer saves Bob $3,500.

Considering the potential for a better deal with Alice is limited, accepting her offer at $11,500 is the best choice."
