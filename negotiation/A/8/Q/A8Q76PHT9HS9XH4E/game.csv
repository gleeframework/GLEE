"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go below $11000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers, so I'll counter with a price of $10900. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you is $10000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",10900.0,Alice,5,
