Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. It's worth a lot to me, and I believe it could be incredibly valuable for your needs as well. My initial offer is $1,500,000. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1500000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your initial offer is much higher than my budget. I'm interested in this product, but I can only go up to $800000. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $800,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than my minimum price of $1,200,000. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I'll need to see a higher offer from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While $800,000 is too low for me, I'm willing to be flexible.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. This gives us both a fair deal and allows me to keep the product within a reasonable range for my needs."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1100000 is still outside my budget.  I'm firm on $800000. If you're serious about selling, let's find a way to bridge the gap.  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While I'd like to continue negotiating with Bob, I'm concerned that he's unwilling to budge from his $800,000 offer.  At this point, selling to John for $1,200,000 guarantees me a profit and avoids the risk of further rounds of negotiation with Bob that may lead to a lower price or no deal at all."
