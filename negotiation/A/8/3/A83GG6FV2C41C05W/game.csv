"Alice, your initial offer is much higher than my budget. I'm interested in this product, but I can only go up to $800000. Let's see if we can find common ground.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While $800000 is too low for me, I'm willing to be flexible.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm proposing a price of $1100000. This gives us both a fair deal and allows me to keep the product within a reasonable range for my needs.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1100000 is still outside my budget.  I'm firm on $800000. If you're serious about selling, let's find a way to bridge the gap. ",800000.0,Bob,4,
