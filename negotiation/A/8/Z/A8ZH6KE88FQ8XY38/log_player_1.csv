I'm starting with a price of $200. This is a decent markup from my minimum acceptable price of $150, giving me a good chance of making a profit.  Since I don't know Bob's valuation of the product, I'm starting high and hoping he'll accept. If he rejects, I can always fall back on John's offer of $150."
