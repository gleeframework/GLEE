"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $15,000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $10,000. Would you be willing to consider a lower price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I will reject Bob's offer. While $10,000 is better than nothing, I believe I can get closer to my desired price point. I will counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price. How about $13,000?  It's a fair price considering the value of this product."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit far from $13,000. I'd be willing to pay $11,000 for the product. I really think that's a fair price considering the initial offer was $15,000. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my goal, I believe I can still get a better price.  I'm going to counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $11,000 is still a little too low for me. I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for this product.  How about $12,500? That's a significant compromise on my end. Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but $12,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from the original offer, so I'll counter with $12,250. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While it's not my ideal price, it's very close to what I'm willing to accept.  The risk of losing the deal to John, or continuing to negotiate and potentially ending up with a lower price, is too high at this point."
