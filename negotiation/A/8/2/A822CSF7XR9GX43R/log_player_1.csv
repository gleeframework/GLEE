Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $150. I believe it offers significant value at this price. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 150
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with an offer higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Not Too High:** While we want to maximize profit, setting the price absurdly high ($200+) could instantly turn Bob away.  A price of $150 is a significant markup but still within a reasonable range considering the product's value to him.
* **Justification:** By mentioning ""significant value,"" we subtly anchor the price in Bob's mind, potentially making him more receptive.

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to adjust your price slightly downward if Bob counters or seems hesitant.  However, always remember your bottom line is $120."
