"Thank you for your initial offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,900,000 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,700,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the market value and my budget.",1700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I acknowledge your perspective on the price, I believe the product's value warrants a higher figure.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,825,000. This reflects the true worth of what's being offered.",1825000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for considering my previous offer, Alice. I understand your perspective on the product's value, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make a new counteroffer of $1,750,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget. Can we meet at this price?",1750000.0,Bob,4,
