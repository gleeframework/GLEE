Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you might be interested in. I'm asking for $119 for it. Let me know if you're interested!"", 
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get the highest price possible from Bob.
* **Bob's Valuation:**  We know Bob values the product at $100. 
* **Alternative Buyer:** We have a guaranteed sale to John for $120. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product slightly below John's price ($119) creates a sense of urgency and potential deal for Bob, while still securing a profit above Bob's valuation.

**Why this strategy is better than others:**

* **Offering at $120 or higher:** Bob will definitely reject, and we'll get the guaranteed $120 from John (no profit maximization).
* **Offering at or slightly above $100:** While Bob might accept, we leave potential profit on the table. 
 
This strategy aims to strike a balance between securing a sale and maximizing profit."
