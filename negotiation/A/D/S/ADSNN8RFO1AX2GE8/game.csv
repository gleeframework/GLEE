"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the purchase of my product with you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. As we're starting the negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $1,300,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's worth to you is $1,200,000. I'm confident you'll find it a fair starting point. What are your thoughts?",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that my product is worth more to you than $1,000,000. Considering our initial discussion, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering a revised price of $1,200,000. This is a fair compromise, taking into account your valuation of the product. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,3,
