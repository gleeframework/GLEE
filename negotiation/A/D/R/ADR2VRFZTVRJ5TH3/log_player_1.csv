"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $140. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $140, as it's a good starting point above my minimum value. I'm also trying to build rapport and make Bob feel valued. Let's see how he responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. I'm willing to pay a fair price for the product, but I'm trying to stay within a budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $100 is better than nothing, it's significantly below my minimum value of $120. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $100 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to make sure I get a fair price for the product. How about $115? It's still a good deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 115} 
```

I'm offering $115, which is a compromise. I'm acknowledging Bob's budget concerns, but I'm also emphasizing the value of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're trying to get a fair price, but $115 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $110. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd prefer a higher price, $110 is above my minimum value of $120.  Considering it's round 4, and I don't want to risk losing the deal completely, I'll accept Bob's offer."
