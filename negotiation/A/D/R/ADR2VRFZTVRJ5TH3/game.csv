"Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $100 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to make sure I get a fair price for the product. How about $115? It's still a good deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price. Let me know what you think!",115.0,Alice,3,
