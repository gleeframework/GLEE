"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,000,000. I think this is a fair price, considering its value to you is $800,000. What do you think?

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that the product is worth more to you than that. After reconsidering, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $900,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise. What do you think?

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product at $700,000. Considering the value it holds for me, I'm willing to meet you at $850,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000

At this point, Alice has shown she's unwilling to go below $850,000.  It's better to secure the product from John at $800,000 and avoid further negotiation."
