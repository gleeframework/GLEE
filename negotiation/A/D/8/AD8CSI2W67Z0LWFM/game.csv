"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I think that's a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $9,000 is significantly below its true value. I could come down to $11,000, which is a very competitive offer.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still interested in the product, but $11,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,000 and $11,000. How about $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,4,
