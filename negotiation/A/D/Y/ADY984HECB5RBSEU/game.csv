"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and would like to propose a price of $110 for the product. This is higher than my initial offer but lower than my starting point. I believe this could be a fair compromise for both of us.",110.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, $110 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $108. This is a fair compromise that's closer to our target price. What do you think?",108.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I'm glad we're getting closer. I would like to propose a price of $107 for the product. This is a reasonable compromise considering its value to you. I hope you'll find it acceptable.",107.0,Alice,5,
