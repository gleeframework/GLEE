Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

This offer is a good balance between maximizing your profit and increasing the likelihood of Bob accepting. Here's why:

* **You gain a significant profit:**  You'll earn $150,000 more than your minimum acceptable price.
* **Bob gets a good deal:** He saves $50,000 compared to his perceived value.
* **It's likely to be accepted:** Bob has a strong incentive to accept as he's still getting the product at a lower price than he'd be willing to pay.

While you could potentially try to push for a higher price, there's a risk that Bob might reject and you'd be left with the $800,000 offer from John. This offer strikes a good balance between risk and reward."
