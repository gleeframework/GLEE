Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal considering its worth to you.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. I'm aiming for a price closer to the product's value to Bob, but I'm also leaving room for negotiation. I want to see if he's willing to meet me halfway, or if I need to adjust my strategy."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $10,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $10,000 is a decent offer, I believe I can still get a better price.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is still a bit low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,000?  This would still be a great deal for you, as the product is worth $15,000 to you.  Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 11000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me. $11,000 is getting closer, but I'm trying to be mindful of my budget. Could you do $10,500? That would work for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer a higher price, $10,500 is a good compromise and closer to my minimum goal. Accepting Bob's offer ensures a sale and is a better outcome than selling to John for $8,000."
