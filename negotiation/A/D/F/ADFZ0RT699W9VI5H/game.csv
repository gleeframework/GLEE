"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $850,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000, which is still a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement here.",900000.0,Alice,3,
