``` 

I'm starting high, knowing Bob values the product at $1,000,000. This leaves room for negotiation, and I'm hoping to secure a price closer to my minimum of $1,500,000."

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product is high to you, but I am looking to stay within my budget. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,400,000.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

While $1,400,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still below what I'm hoping for.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a middle ground."
