"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'd like to offer you a great deal on this product, but I need to make sure I can cover my costs. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $180. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

Alice's offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget and even more than John's offer. It makes the most sense to go directly to John and purchase the product for $100."
