"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

I'm starting high, at $1,500,000. This sets a strong initial position and leaves room for negotiation. It's also a good starting point to gauge Bob's interest and assess his potential value for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,200,000 is a decent amount, it's still below my minimum target of $1,000,000. I'll keep negotiating with Bob in hopes of getting closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000}
```

I'm counter-offering with $1,350,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but it's still above Bob's counteroffer. It shows I'm willing to negotiate but also that I value the product highly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

Bob has increased his offer to $1,250,000, which is above my minimum target of $1,000,000.  I'm accepting his offer to close the deal and secure a profit."
