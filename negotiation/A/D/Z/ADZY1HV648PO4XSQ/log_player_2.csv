{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Explanation:**

This counteroffer represents your absolute maximum budget.  It's highly unlikely Alice will accept this price, but it's a starting point for negotiation. If she rejects, you'll need to decide whether to make a slightly higher counteroffer or purchase from John."

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,500

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $16,500 is closer to your budget than Alice's initial offer, it's still above your limit.  There's a good chance you can negotiate a better price or buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Explanation:**

This counteroffer is a compromise. It's higher than your initial offer but still below Alice's current price. It shows that you are willing to negotiate but also have a firm limit. It increases the chances of Alice accepting your offer while staying within your budget."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has clearly shown she's not willing to go much lower than $16,000.  While $16,200 is slightly lower than her previous offer, it's still not worth it for you.  It's better to purchase from John at $12,000 and avoid further negotiations."
