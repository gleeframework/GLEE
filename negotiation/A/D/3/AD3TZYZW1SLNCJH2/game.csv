"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate it. However, I am only willing to pay up to $12,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me. Please let me know if this is possible.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $12,000 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $13,500. This is a significant price reduction from my initial offer, and still offers you a good deal. Let's see if we can make this work.",13500.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. While I appreciate the reduction, I'm still unable to meet you at $13,500. I would like to stick to my original offer of $12,000. Let me know if this is possible.",12000.0,Bob,4,
