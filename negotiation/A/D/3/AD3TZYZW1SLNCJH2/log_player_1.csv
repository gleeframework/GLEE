Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000.  It's a great deal for both of us, as it's below my minimum and still a good value for you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Offering $14,000 gives me some room to negotiate down if Bob counters. 
* **Value Proposition:**  The message emphasizes the deal's benefit for Bob, making it more likely he'll consider accepting.
* **Flexibility:** This price allows me to still sell to John for $15,000 if Bob rejects the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate it. However, I am only willing to pay up to $12,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me. Please let me know if this is possible. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** $12,000 is significantly below my minimum of $15,000 and doesn't make financial sense for me.
* **Potential for Negotiation:**  While Bob is firm, I can still try to negotiate a higher price.  
* **Selling to John:** Selling to John for $15,000 guarantees my minimum price, but I'd prefer to explore negotiation further with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $12,000 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $13,500. This is a significant price reduction from my initial offer, and still offers you a good deal. Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  By moving to $13,500, I'm showing a willingness to negotiate while still staying above my minimum.
* **Positive Framing:** Emphasize the ""significant price reduction"" and ""good deal"" for Bob to make the offer more attractive.
* **Maintaining Flexibility:**  $13,500 is still a good outcome for me, but I'm keeping the option open to sell to John if Bob rejects this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. While I appreciate the reduction, I'm still unable to meet you at $13,500. I would like to stick to my original offer of $12,000. Let me know if this is possible. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Stalemate:** Bob has remained firm at $12,000, which is significantly below my minimum price. 
* **No Further Room:**  There's no point in continuing to negotiate with Bob, as he's not likely to budge.
* **Guaranteed Profit:** Selling to John for $15,000 ensures I meet my minimum requirement and don't lose out on potential profit. 

While I'd prefer to make a higher profit, securing the $15,000 sale to John is the most prudent decision at this point."
