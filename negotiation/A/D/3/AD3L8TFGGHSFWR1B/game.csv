,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $250 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  How about $100?  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $180. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit on this sale.",180.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down a bit, Alice, but $180 is still a bit steep for me.  I'm happy to pay $150.  Let's see if we can make a deal at that price.",150.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to my minimum price, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $175, but I'm not going any lower than that. This is a one-time offer, so let's see if we can make a deal.",175.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $175 is still more than I'm willing to pay.  Let's split the difference and go with $162.50.  I'm sure we can find common ground at this price.",162.5,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go any lower than $170, Bob. I've already met you halfway and given you a good deal. I'm starting to think I should consider selling to John for $150, but I'm still open to negotiating with you.",170.0,Alice,7,
