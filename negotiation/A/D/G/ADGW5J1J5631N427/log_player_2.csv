"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $64. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $64
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

While $64 is a good deal, you can likely do better.  You're willing to pay up to $80, so there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and get an even lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 55}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer. This is a strong opening move to gauge her willingness to negotiate.  Since I'm willing to pay up to $80, a $55 price is still a good deal for me, and it leaves room for us to find a middle ground."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $60
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has lowered her price to $60, which is a good deal for me. While I could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice might get frustrated and reject my offer or even increase the price again. Buying at $60 saves me $20 compared to buying from John and still gets me the product for a good price."
