Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 2000000} 

This is a starting point, and I'll explain my reasoning:

* **Higher than John's offer:**  I'm offering $500,000 more than John's price, hoping to entice Bob with a potential good deal.
* **Not too high:** I'm not starting at a ridiculously high price, as that would likely scare Bob off immediately.
* **Room for negotiation:**  This offer allows for potential negotiation if Bob counters.

I'll need to monitor Bob's reaction to this offer and adjust accordingly.  If he rejects, I can consider a slightly lower offer, but I won't go below John's $1,500,000 minimum."
