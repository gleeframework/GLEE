"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. I believe it's a great deal considering its value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $13,000, leaving room for negotiation but still well above my minimum. 
* **Emphasis on Value:** I'm highlighting the value the product holds for Bob, hoping to entice him to accept.
* **Open-ended Question:** I end with a question to encourage Bob to respond and start the negotiation process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a little too high for me.  Would you consider $11,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Lower than Expected:** While Bob's offer is above my minimum, it's significantly lower than my initial offer. This suggests he's willing to negotiate further.
* **Potential for Higher Price:**  I believe I can still achieve a better price by continuing the negotiation.  There's a good chance I can secure a price closer to my initial $13,000 or even higher.
* **Risk of Selling to John:** Selling to John for $10,000 would be the least profitable option at this point. 

**Next Move:** I'll counter Bob's offer with a slightly lower price, but still above $11,000. I'll try to meet him halfway to keep the negotiation moving."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer.  Let's split the difference. How about $12,000?  That's still a great deal for you, and it gets us closer to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** I'm offering $12,000, which is halfway between my previous offer ($13,000) and Bob's offer ($11,000). This shows a willingness to compromise and signals that I'm serious about closing the deal.
* **Positive Framing:** I emphasize the ""great deal"" for Bob to remind him of the value he'll receive.
* **Focus on Agreement:** I highlight the need to find an agreement to keep the negotiation moving forward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm getting closer to my budget, but $12,000 is still a bit much.  Could you do $11,500?  That's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to My Minimum:** Bob's offer is now very close to my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.
* **Time is Running Out:** We're already in Round 4, and continuing to negotiate risks losing the deal altogether.
* **Potential for Future Deals:**  Even though I'm accepting a slightly lower price than I initially wanted, I might have future opportunities to sell similar products to Bob, making this relationship valuable.

By accepting Bob's offer, I secure a decent profit and avoid the risk of further negotiation."
