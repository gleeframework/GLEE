{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $175. It's a great deal for a product worth much more.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value but still lower than my minimum. This creates room for negotiation and potentially allows me to reach a price closer to my desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, $175 is a bit out of my price range. I'm really interested in your product, but I can only offer $80 right now.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is far below my minimum acceptable price.  I will reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $80 is just too low for me.  How about we split the difference and I offer it to you for $125? It's still a great price for the quality of this product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 125}
``` 
This counteroffer is closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum. I'm hoping this will encourage him to come up a bit more in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $125 is still a bit too high for me.  Would you be willing to go down to $100? That's the absolute maximum I can pay. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $100 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below what I want to get for the product.  I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a bit higher in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  $100 is still a little too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $115. That's a fair price for a product that's worth so much more.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 115} 
```

I'm offering a price closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum. I'm hoping that this offer will convince him to buy the product."
