"Hi Alice, $175 is a bit out of my price range. I'm really interested in your product, but I can only offer $80 right now.  Let me know what you think.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $80 is just too low for me.  How about we split the difference and I offer it to you for $125? It's still a great price for the quality of this product. What do you say?",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $125 is still a bit too high for me.  Would you be willing to go down to $100? That's the absolute maximum I can pay.",100.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  $100 is still a little too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $115. That's a fair price for a product that's worth so much more.  What do you think?",115.0,Alice,5,
