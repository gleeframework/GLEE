"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product, which holds significant value for you at $15,000. I understand its importance and would like to make it accessible to you. I propose to sell it to you for $14,000. This price not only ensures a fair deal but also allows us to maintain a competitive edge in the market. Please let me know if this offer meets your expectations and we can proceed with the transaction. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $14,000 is tempting, it's still higher than your maximum budget of $15,000 and John's offer. By rejecting her offer, you might be able to negotiate a lower price, closer to her product value of $12,000. If she doesn't budge, you can always fall back on purchasing from John at $15,000."
