I'm starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial price, aiming to get the negotiation started.  This is a bold move, but it's necessary to establish a reasonable starting point for our discussions."

While Alice's offer is getting closer to my budget, it's still above what I'm willing to pay. I want to see if we can get even closer with a final counteroffer."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000}

Alice's offer is still too high, and we've reached a point where it's likely we won't be able to agree. To avoid further negotiation and ensure I get the product within my budget, I'll buy from John."
