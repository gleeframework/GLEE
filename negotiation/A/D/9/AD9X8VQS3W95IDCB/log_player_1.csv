Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $17,000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 17000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's slightly higher than Bob's estimated value. This allows for some negotiation room while still ensuring I get a profit.  I'm also being friendly and open to discussion, hoping to encourage a positive interaction."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $12,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price.  I'm not willing to sell for that low.  I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my original price. How about $15,500? This is still a good deal for you considering the product's value."", ""product_price"": 15500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $15,500 is still a bit too high for my budget.  Could we settle at $14,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $14,000 is close to my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  While it's not ideal, it's better than selling to John for $15,000. I'm willing to accept this offer to avoid further negotiation and ensure a sale."
