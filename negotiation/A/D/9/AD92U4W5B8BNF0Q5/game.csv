"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value it holds for me.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate you countering.  While I understand your perspective on the value, the product's worth significantly exceeds that figure in my estimation. I could consider letting it go for $1,300,000. This is a considerable reduction on my initial offer and reflects my willingness to find a compromise.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for considering my previous offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I see in the product, and I'm willing to meet you halfway between our initial offers.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
