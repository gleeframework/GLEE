"Hello Bob! I'm excited to show you this amazing product. I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm definitely interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider lowering the price to $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $12,000 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer it to you for $11,500. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really like the product.",11500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you working with me, Alice. $11,500 is closer to what I had in mind, but still a little high for me. Would you be willing to settle at $10,500?",10500.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $11,500 is still a bit high for you, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll offer it to you for $11,200. This is as low as I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",11200.0,Alice,5,

"I've gone as low as I can, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $11,000 and my original offer of $12,000. I'll offer it to you for $11,400. This is my final concession, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",11400.0,Alice,7,
