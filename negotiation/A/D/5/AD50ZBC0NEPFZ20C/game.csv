"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $950000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value and rarity.",950000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm very interested in the product, but $950000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay up to $850000 for it. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value and rarity.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $850000 is a bit lower than my initial asking price, but I'm willing to consider a compromise. I'm thinking of a price closer to the middle ground. I'll offer you the product for $900000. It's a fair price considering the product's value and rarity, and I believe it's a good compromise for both of us.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $900000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay up to $820000 for the product. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price.",820000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $820000 is a bit lower than my previous offer, but I'm willing to consider it. However, I'm not willing to go that low. I'll offer you a compromise at $880000. It's still a good price for the product, and I think it's a fair compromise. Let me know if you're willing to meet me in the middle.",880000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Alice. However, $880000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $840000. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price.",840000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're getting too far apart, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll offer you the product for $860000. It's still a good price, and I think it's a fair compromise. Let me know if you're willing to meet me at this price.",860000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your last concession, Alice. However, $860000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $830000, but that's as high as I can go. I'm hoping we can meet at this price and finalize the deal.",830000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to accepting your offer, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'll make one more concession. I'll offer you the product for $845000. It's a small increase from my previous offer, but I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value. Let me know if you're willing to meet me at this price.",845000.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm afraid $845000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to walk away from the deal if we can't meet at a price I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay up to $825000, but that's my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me at that price, I'll have to consider buying from John for $800000.",825000.0,Bob,10,
