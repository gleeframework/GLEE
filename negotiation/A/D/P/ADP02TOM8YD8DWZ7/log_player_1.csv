Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  $1,100,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to spend closer to $950,000.  This is a significant investment for me, and I want to ensure a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can find some common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  I understand your perspective on the product's value, but $1,025,000 is still a bit high for me.  Let's split the difference and aim for $987,500. This would be a fair price that allows both of us to walk away satisfied.  What are your thoughts?

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,000,000 is still a bit above my budget.  Let's aim for $993,750.  This is a fair compromise that brings us closer to a deal.  What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $993,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $993,750

While I could hold out for a slightly higher price, Bob is consistently moving towards a fair deal. Accepting $993,750 guarantees a significant profit and avoids the risk of losing the sale altogether by pushing for too much."
