"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $8000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to be compensated for the value of the product. How about $8500? This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's fair to both of us.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $7500 just doesn't work for me.  Let's try to meet in the middle. I'm willing to go down to $8250. This is a fair price that considers both our needs. Let me know what you think.",8250.0,Alice,5,
