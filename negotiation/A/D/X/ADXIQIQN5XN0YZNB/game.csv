"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I appreciate the value, but $900,000 is a bit high for my budget.  Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $700,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but how about $850,000? This would still allow me to make a reasonable profit while giving you a good deal.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $850,000 is closer, but I'm trying to stay under $800,000.  How about we split the difference and do $775,000?",775000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I'm happy to continue negotiating, but $775,000 is still a bit low for me.  Let's meet in the middle at $825,000.  This would give both of us a fair deal.",825000.0,Alice,5,
