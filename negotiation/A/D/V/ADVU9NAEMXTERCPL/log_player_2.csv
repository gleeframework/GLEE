Alice's offer is too high. It's worth rejecting and trying to negotiate a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to make a counteroffer, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to accept $850,000. Considering the product's value to you is $800,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $1,000,000. This is a reasonable compromise, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.

Alice's counteroffer is still too high. While it's closer to my budget, I'm still willing to negotiate further to try and get a lower price."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,000,000 is still a bit too steep for me.  I'm willing to go up to $900,000, which is a fair compromise, and allows us both to walk away happy.  Let's finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000. I'm willing to meet you at $950,000, which is still a significant discount from my original price. I believe this is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to me is $1,500,000. Let's see if we can finalize the deal at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000.

While Alice is getting closer to my budget, $950,000 is still more than I'm comfortable paying.  It's better to buy from John at this point and save the extra $150,000."
