Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $1,199,999. I know it's a significant investment, but I truly believe in its value and its potential to benefit you greatly.  Let me know if you have any questions or would like to discuss further."", 
""product_price"": 1199999
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, you want to push Bob as close to that price as possible.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While the offer is very high, it leaves a tiny bit of room for Bob to potentially counter-offer. Even if he negotiates down slightly, you're still making a substantial profit.
* **Confident Tone:** The message emphasizes the product's value, suggesting it's worth the high price. This can potentially sway Bob even if he initially balks at the number."
