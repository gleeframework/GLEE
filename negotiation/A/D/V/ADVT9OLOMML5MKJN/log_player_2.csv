Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $975,000 is still a bit above your comfort zone, but I'm not willing to go as low as that. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you the product for $1,025,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?

Alice seems unlikely to go much lower than $1,025,000. At this point, the potential savings from further negotiation are outweighed by the risk of Alice refusing and forcing me to buy from John anyway.  It's a better strategy to secure the $1,000,000 deal with John."
