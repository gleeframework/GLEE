"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think you'll find it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-value item. I'm willing to start the conversation with a price of $900,000. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I'm interested in the product, $900,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000.  What do you think?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob. However, $850,000 is still a bit lower than my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $875,000. What do you think?",875000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $875,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm prepared to pay $825,000. This is a fair price that allows both of us to benefit from the deal. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",825000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. However, $825,000 is getting closer to my minimum price, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm counteroffering at $850,000 again, but I'll throw in a small concession: I'll give you a 1% discount if you're willing to pay the full $850,000. This is my final offer. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,5,
