"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $120 is a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $90 for it. Let me know what you think.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $90 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $105? It's a fair price for both of us.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $105 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $95.  This is my final offer.  Let me know if you're willing to accept.",95.0,Bob,4,
