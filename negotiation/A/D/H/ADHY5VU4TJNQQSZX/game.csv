"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you coming down to $800000, but that's still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $700000.  This is a fair price considering the product's value and the potential savings it offers. Let me know what you think.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $700000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of counteroffering at $750000.
