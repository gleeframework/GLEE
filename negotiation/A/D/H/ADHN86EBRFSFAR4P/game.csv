"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. My initial offer is $9,000. I think this is a fair price considering its value to you, but I'm open to negotiating. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $9,000 is a little steep for me. Would you consider a price closer to $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $7,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. My counteroffer is $8,200. I believe this price still reflects the value the product will bring to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. What do you think?",8200.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice.  How about we meet in the middle at $7,600? I think that's a fair compromise.",7600.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your proposal, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, I'm still not quite there. My next counteroffer is $8,100. I believe this price still reflects the value the product will bring to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. What do you think?",8100.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I'm trying to make this work, but $8,100 is still pushing it for me. I can go up to $7,800, but that's my absolute limit. It's a fair offer considering the market value.",7800.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. My next counteroffer is $8,050. I believe this price is still a fair reflection of the product's value, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. What do you think?",8050.0,Alice,7,
