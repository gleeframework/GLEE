,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider a lower price? I'm thinking around $100.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $150 is a bit steep for you. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $100. How about we meet in the middle at $125? I think it's a fair price considering the value this product can bring to you.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand your point, but $125 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $100 and $125. Would you consider selling it to me for $112.50?",112.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $112.50. I'm willing to compromise further and offer it to you for $120. It's the lowest I'm willing to go, considering the value this product can bring to you.",120.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand your willingness to compromise, but $120 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $115, but no higher. Can you meet me at that price?",115.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your willingness to go up to $115, but I'm still not willing to sell it to you at that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $120 and $115, which would be $117.50. It's the highest I'm willing to go, considering the value this product can bring to you.",117.5,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand your willingness to meet me halfway, but $117.50 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $114, but no higher. Can you meet me at that price?",114.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your willingness to go up to $114, but I'm still not willing to sell it to you at that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $117.50 and $114, which would be $115.75. It's the highest I'm willing to go, considering the value this product can bring to you.",115.75,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand your willingness to meet me halfway, but $115.75 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I've reached my limit and I'm not willing to go any higher. I think we've gone as far as we can, and I'm going to have to pass on this deal. I'll consider buying it from John for $80 instead.",80.0,Bob,10,
