"I understand you're interested in the product, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,350,000. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings to you.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However,  $1,350,000 is still a bit steep for me.  I'd be willing to go up to $1,100,000. Let me know if that works for you.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm glad we're close, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,100,000. I'm willing to compromise and offer it to you for $1,225,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value.",1225000.0,Alice,5,
