"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $18,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value of $15,000, but I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium.  If he rejects this offer, I'll be prepared to negotiate down, but I want to maximize my profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's closer to my minimum value, I'm still hoping to get closer to my initial asking price.  I'll counter with a lower price in the next round, but still above Bob's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17000}
```

I'm countering with $17,000. This is a compromise, coming down from my initial offer but still leaving some room for profit. I believe this is a fair price, given Bob's willingness to pay $16,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, I'm still hoping to get closer to $17,000. I'll counter with a slightly lower price in the next round, but I believe I can still get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 16800}
```

I'm offering $16,800.  It's a small concession from my previous offer, but I think it shows I'm serious about making a deal. Bob has shown he's willing to go up, and I'm hopeful he'll meet me in the middle."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,300. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,300
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd love to get closer to my initial asking price, we're running out of rounds. Accepting Bob's offer of $16,300 will secure a profit and ensure a deal.  It's more than John's offer, and the risk of going back and forth with Bob could lead to a lower price or no deal at all."
