{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the product for $950,000.  I believe this is a fair price given its value to you.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Offering $950,000 leaves room for negotiation but still gets you a significant portion of the potential value to Bob.
* **Fairness:**  The message emphasizes a fair price, potentially increasing Bob's willingness to negotiate.
* **Openness:**  The message encourages Bob to respond, keeping the negotiation active. 

**Important Note:** This is just the first offer. Be prepared to adjust based on Bob's response.  If he rejects, consider lowering your offer slightly, but always be mindful of your minimum acceptable price ($800,000). You can also use the threat of selling to John to motivate Bob to accept a price closer to your ideal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $820,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $820,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $820,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below your minimum acceptable price ($800,000).** 
* **You have leverage:**  You can counteroffer or sell to John.  
* **Counteroffering opens the possibility of a better deal.**  While $820,000 is close to your minimum, there's still potential to reach a price closer to your target ($950,000).

**Next Steps:**

You should counteroffer Bob, aiming for a price closer to your initial offer of $950,000.  Be prepared to negotiate, but don't let him push you too far below your minimum acceptable price.  Remember, you always have the option to sell to John as a backup."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your offer, but it's a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $875,000 for the product.  This reflects a significant price reduction from my initial offer and brings us closer to a mutually beneficial agreement.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap."", ""product_price"": 875000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter Offer:**  We are making a counteroffer to Bob, demonstrating our willingness to negotiate.
* **Price Point:** $875,000 is a compromise that is still above your minimum acceptable price but closer to Bob's offer.
* **Messaging:** The message emphasizes compromise and a desire for a mutually beneficial agreement, which can help keep the negotiation positive.

**Why this approach:**

* **Balancing leverage:** While we're willing to negotiate, we're not giving in completely.  $875,000 is still a good price for you.
* **Motivating Bob:** The message implies that you are willing to negotiate, but not too far. It can encourage Bob to make a higher counteroffer.
* **Preparing for the next round:**  If Bob rejects this counteroffer, you have more information to work with for the next round."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to adjust your offer, Alice. I would like to counter with $860,000 for the product. I hope this proposal is acceptable and we can reach an agreement that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $860,000.

* **Counteroffering remains a better option:**  You have the opportunity to potentially reach a price closer to your target of $950,000 by making another counteroffer. 
* **Selling to John is a backup:**  While you could sell to John for $800,000, you're better off trying to get closer to your desired price through continued negotiation.

**Next Steps:**

You should make another counteroffer to Bob.  Since you're approaching your minimum acceptable price, consider offering $840,000.  This is a compromise that's still above your minimum but shows your willingness to negotiate further.  Remember to frame your message in a way that motivates Bob to come up in price."
