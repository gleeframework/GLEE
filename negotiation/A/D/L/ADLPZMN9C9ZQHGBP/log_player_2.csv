"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really enjoy it. I'm offering it to you for $100. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to get the product for as cheap as possible, and he knows it's worth no more than $80 to him.  Alice's initial offer of $100 is too high. It's better to reject and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $100 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $85 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 85} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a lower offer close to his maximum price, but leaving room for negotiation. This shows he's serious about buying the product but also wants a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $95. It's a fair price for both of us, and I think you'll be happy with the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $95 is closer to Bob's maximum price, it's still not ideal. He knows he can get the product for $80 from John. Rejecting and counter-offering again gives Bob a chance to push for a better price before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $95 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm really serious about buying this, but $90 is my absolute limit. Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 90} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is making another counter-offer, but this time he's showing a bit more urgency by stating his absolute limit. He's trying to push Alice closer to his target price. He's also reinforcing his interest in buying the product to incentivize Alice to accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but I can't go lower than $92.  It's a fair price for a great product, and I think you'll be happy with it. Let's make this deal happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still determined to get the best deal possible.  He can get the product for $80 from John, so Alice's offer of $92 is still too high.  He's willing to risk another round of negotiations to try and get closer to his target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to go up to $91, but that's really my final offer. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 91} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is making a final push by increasing his offer to $91. This shows Alice that he's serious about buying the product and is willing to pay almost her price. It's a calculated risk, but it might be enough to convince Alice to accept."
