"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product. It's worth a lot to me, but I believe its value to you is even greater. I'm confident it can bring significant benefit to your operations.  My initial offer is $1,200,000. This reflects the value I place on the product, while still offering you a substantial margin.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your initial offer, Alice. I appreciate your confidence in the product's value. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,000,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's worth to me.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,000,000 doesn't quite reflect the product's true potential. I'm willing to compromise, but I need a price that acknowledges its value. How about $1,100,000? This is a fair price considering the benefits you'll gain from this investment.  Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Alice, but I still think $1,100,000 is a bit high. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,050,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,050,000 is still a bit lower than where I need to be. I'm willing to come down a little further, but I need a price that reflects the product's true value. I'm prepared to accept $1,075,000. This is my final offer before I explore other options. Let's close this deal and make this a mutually beneficial arrangement.",1075000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand your persistence, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,075,000. I'm willing to go up to $1,070,000, but that's my final offer. I'm not willing to go any higher.",1070000.0,Bob,6,
