Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product. It's worth a lot to me, but I believe its value to you is even greater. I'm confident it can bring significant benefit to your operations.  My initial offer is $1,200,000. This reflects the value I place on the product, while still offering you a substantial margin."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your initial offer, Alice. I appreciate your confidence in the product's value. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,000,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's worth to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,000,000 is a better price than his initial rejection, I still believe the product is worth more. I'm going to try to get closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,000,000 doesn't quite reflect the product's true potential. I'm willing to compromise, but I need a price that acknowledges its value. How about $1,100,000? This is a fair price considering the benefits you'll gain from this investment.  Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, Alice, but I still think $1,100,000 is a bit high. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,050,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While it's closer to what I want, I believe we can still reach a more agreeable price. I'm going to try one more counteroffer before seriously considering selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,050,000 is still a bit lower than where I need to be. I'm willing to come down a little further, but I need a price that reflects the product's true value. I'm prepared to accept $1,075,000. This is my final offer before I explore other options. Let's close this deal and make this a mutually beneficial arrangement."", ""product_price"": 1075000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your persistence, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,075,000. I'm willing to go up to $1,070,000, but that's my final offer. I'm not willing to go any higher. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,070,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,070,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John.  Bob is clearly unwilling to come up to a price that is close to what I believe the product is worth. While I would prefer to get closer to my desired price, selling to John will still get me a significant amount of money and avoid further negotiation with Bob."
