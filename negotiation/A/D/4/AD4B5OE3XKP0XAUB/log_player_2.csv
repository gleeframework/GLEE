"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the product for $180. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is too high. I should try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm really interested in the product, but $180 is a bit too steep for me. Would you consider $110?"", 
""product_price"": 110
}
``` 

I'm starting with a significantly lower offer to see how much room there is for negotiation. This gives Alice the opportunity to counter and me to assess the situation further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob! However, $110 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $165. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $165. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $165
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is coming down, but $165 is still more than I want to pay. I'll try to meet closer to the middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand, Alice. How about we settle at $130?  That feels like a fair compromise to me."", 
""product_price"": 130
}
``` 

This offer aims for a price closer to the middle ground between our previous offers. It keeps the negotiation moving while still aiming for a significant discount."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're close, Bob! However, $130 is still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to meet you at $155. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $155. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $155
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $155.  It's not worth the further negotiation to save $5, so I'll take John's offer."
