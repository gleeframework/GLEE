"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I really appreciate it. However, $150 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend.  How about $110? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",110.0,Bob,2,

"I understand where you're coming from, Bob! I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we compromise at 130? It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love the product!",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $130 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Let's try $115.  That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll still make a profit on the sale.",115.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as 115. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway again. How about we compromise at 125? It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love the product!",125.0,Alice,5,
