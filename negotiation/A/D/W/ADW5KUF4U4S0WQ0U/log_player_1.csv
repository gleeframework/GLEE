Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $175.  It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 175}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$175 is a starting point:** It's higher than Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **The message is positive and encouraging:** It focuses on the value of the product and aims to build a rapport with Bob.

**This strategy is based on the following:**

* **Maximizing profit:**  I'm aiming for a price higher than Bob's perceived value, but I'm also aware of John's offer, giving me a fallback option.
* **Starting high:** It gives me room to negotiate downwards while still potentially securing a good profit.
* **Maintaining a positive tone:** This encourages Bob to engage in the negotiation rather than feeling pressured or insulted."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $120 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150.  By rejecting Bob's offer, I maintain the opportunity to negotiate a better price or fall back on John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $120 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $140.  This is still a great deal for a product that's worth a lot more.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 140}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer is higher than Bob's offer but lower than my initial offer:** This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate.
* **Message emphasizes value and fairness:**  I'm highlighting the product's worth and suggesting a compromise.
* **Open to further negotiation:**  I'm ending the message with a positive tone, suggesting a possibility of reaching an agreement. 

This approach balances my goal of maximizing profit with the risk of Bob walking away."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $140 is still a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $130 for the product. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $130 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below it.  Given that I'm already in the third round of negotiation, there's a high chance that Bob might continue to try and lower the price further. To avoid potentially losing more money, I'm choosing to sell the product to John for $150. 

This decision secures me a profitable sale and avoids the risk of further negotiation that might lead to a lower price."
