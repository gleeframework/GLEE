Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $110. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum acceptable price ($100). This gives me room to negotiate down if necessary.
* **Positive Framing:** The message is positive and highlights the value of the product to encourage Bob to consider the offer.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and decide whether to accept or make a counteroffer.
* If the negotiation stalls or Bob's counteroffers become unacceptable, I'll move on to John, who is a guaranteed sale at my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $110 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $65? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $65. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $65
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $65 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $100. Accepting his offer would be a loss for me. I will reject his offer and make a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for the offer, but $65 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $90? That's still a good deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my target price."", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer:**  I'm counter-offering with a price of $90, which is closer to my minimum acceptable price of $100 but still significantly higher than Bob's initial offer. 
* **Middle Ground:**  The message emphasizes meeting in the middle, suggesting a compromise that could be beneficial to both of us. 
* **Positive Framing:** The message remains positive and focuses on the value of the product for Bob.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, I'll finalize the sale.
* If Bob rejects, I'll analyze his next counteroffer and decide whether to accept, counter-offer again, or move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving towards my budget. How about $75? That's a fair price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is moving closer to my minimum acceptable price, $75 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to continue negotiating, but I won't settle for a price that significantly undervalues my product.  

I'll make a counteroffer in the next round, aiming for a price closer to $90."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $75 is still too low for me.  Let's try $85. It's a fair price that allows us both to get a good deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 85}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm offering $85, which is a compromise between my previous offer of $90 and Bob's current offer of $75.
* **Fairness:** I'm framing the offer as a ""fair price"" that benefits both of us.
* **Positive Framing:** The message is still positive and encouraging, aiming to keep the negotiation going.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, I'll finalize the sale.
* If Bob rejects, I'll need to carefully consider my next move: 
    * **Counter Offer Again:** I might counter with a slightly lower price, but I'll be approaching my minimum acceptable price.
    * **Sell to John:**  If Bob's offers consistently remain below my minimum acceptable price, I'll move on to John to avoid further negotiation and ensure a sale at my minimum price."
