"I understand you're close to your limit, Bob, but I'm not willing to sell it to you for $100. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $120 and $100, so I'll offer it to you for $110. Is that something you'd be interested in?",110.0,Alice,7,

"I'm starting to think we're not going to meet in the middle, Bob. I'm willing to make one final offer. I'll sell it to you for $115, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. Is that something you'd be interested in?",115.0,Alice,9,
