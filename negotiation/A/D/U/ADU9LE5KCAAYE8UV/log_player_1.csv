{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a fantastic deal for you, and it allows me to get a good price. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than Bob's perceived value:** This gives him some room to negotiate but still makes the offer attractive.
* **It's lower than your minimum:** This leaves you room to make concessions if necessary.
* **It's a clear and concise message:**  Bob knows exactly what you're offering.

By starting with this offer, you can gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to negotiate. You can adjust your strategy based on his response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $900,000 is tempting, it's far below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to negotiate, but I need to maintain my value.  I'll make a counteroffer to try to bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I need to stay above $1,000,000 to make this worthwhile. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.  This is a fair price that allows us both to get a good deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $1,025,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I would prefer to sell for closer to $1,050,000, Bob's offer of $1,025,000 is getting very close to my minimum acceptable price. It's likely that further negotiation will not yield a significantly better price, and I risk losing the deal entirely.  It's time to accept and secure the sale."
