"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you my product, which I know you've been interested in, for a price that's significantly less than its value to you. This is a chance to secure a valuable asset at a competitive price. I'm confident this will be a mutually beneficial deal.  Let's discuss the details further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
