"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm confident it can greatly benefit you. I'm initially proposing a price of $950,000. I'm open to discussing this further, but I believe this price reflects the true value of what's being offered.",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I see the value in this product, $950,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it.  This is a fair price considering my own valuation and your desire to sell.  Let's see if we can find a common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand your perspective.  I'm confident this product can bring you significant returns, even at a slightly higher price point.  How about we meet in the middle at $900,000? This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges the product's value.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $900,000 is still outside of my comfortable range.  I'm firm on my previous offer of $850,000.  This price reflects the value I see in the product and allows for a reasonable profit for you.  Let's find a way to make this work.",850000.0,Bob,4,
