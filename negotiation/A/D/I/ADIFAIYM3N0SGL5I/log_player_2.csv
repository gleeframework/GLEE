"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm confident it can greatly benefit you. I'm initially proposing a price of $950,000. I'm open to discussing this further, but I believe this price reflects the true value of what's being offered. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above your maximum budget.  It's worth exploring a counteroffer to see if you can negotiate a better price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand your perspective.  I'm confident this product can bring you significant returns, even at a slightly higher price point.  How about we meet in the middle at $900,000? This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges the product's value.

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is coming down in price, $900,000 is still above my budget. I'm going to reject and counteroffer again, hoping to get closer to my desired price point.  There's still potential to negotiate, and I don't want to miss out on the possibility of getting a better deal."
