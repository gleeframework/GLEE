I believe it holds significant value, and I'm confident it can greatly benefit you. I'm initially proposing a price of $950,000.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I see the value in this product, $950,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it.  This is a fair price considering my own valuation and your desire to sell.  Let's see if we can find a common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand your perspective.  I'm confident this product can bring you significant returns, even at a slightly higher price point.  How about we meet in the middle at $900,000? This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges the product's value."", ""product_price"": 900000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $900,000 is still outside of my comfortable range.  I'm firm on my previous offer of $850,000.  This price reflects the value I see in the product and allows for a reasonable profit for you.  Let's find a way to make this work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

While Bob's offer is tempting, it falls significantly short of my minimum. It's clear Bob is unwilling to budge beyond $850,000.  Since I have a guaranteed offer from John at my desired price, it makes the most financial sense to proceed with selling the product to him."
