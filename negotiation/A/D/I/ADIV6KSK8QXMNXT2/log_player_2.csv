Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

``` 

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming to land somewhere in the middle. This shows Alice I'm serious about buying but also that I'm willing to walk away if the price isn't right."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $82.50 is still a bit high for me.  How about $80? That would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 80} 
```

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I see you're getting close to the number I was thinking of, Bob! I'm willing to give you a slight discount, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal too. How about we meet at 81? That's my final offer.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $81, which is within my budget and a good deal compared to John's offer of $120.  While I might be able to negotiate a bit further, I'm confident that I've secured a good price and don't want to risk losing the deal altogether."
