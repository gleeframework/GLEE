(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's far too early to accept Alice's offer.  We need to see if we can get a better price.  Let's counter offer and see where things go."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 250000}
```

We're going to start with a low offer to see if we can get a better price.  $250,000 is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, and it leaves room for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $400,000 is better than Alice's initial offer, it's still a significant amount. Let's see if we can push for a lower price.  There's still room to negotiate, and we can use our ""Buy from John"" option as leverage."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 300000}
```

We're going to increase our offer to $300,000. This shows Alice we're serious about negotiating but still want a good deal.  It's a compromise between our previous offer and Alice's latest one.  Hopefully, this will lead to a quick agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice has come down to $350,000, which is a decent price and still leaves us with a comfortable amount of money. There's a risk of Alice coming down further, but with only 5 rounds left, it's not worth the gamble.  We can get a good deal, and we can use the ""Buy from John"" option as a safety net if we need to."
