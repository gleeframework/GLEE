Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer. I'm really interested in the product, but $180 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $80 for it. What do you think?

I'll reject Bob's offer. $80 is way too low for me, and I'm confident I can get more."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 4

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $100 just isn't enough for me.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to sell it for $125. This is a fair price for both of us, and we can move forward with the sale."", ""product_price"": 125}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $125 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. I'm willing to go up to $110. Let's meet in the middle, and we can close the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell to John for $120.  Bob's offer of $110 is close to my minimum, but I've been through several rounds and I'm starting to run out of time.  It's better to guarantee the sale and get my minimum price."
