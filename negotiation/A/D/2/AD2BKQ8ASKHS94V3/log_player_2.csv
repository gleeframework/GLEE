"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's in excellent condition and worth a lot more to you than the asking price. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $14,000 is a good deal, it's still higher than the product's worth to Alice ($12,000).  There's room for negotiation, and Bob should try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you coming down a bit, but I'm looking to pay closer to $13,000.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a middle ground. He knows the product is worth $12,000 to Alice, so he's offering a price that's slightly higher than that. This demonstrates his willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. How about we split the difference and go with $13,500? It's still a great price for you, and it gets us closer to a deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming for a price closer to $13,000. While $13,500 is a decent deal, he can likely get it for even less with a bit more negotiation. There's still room to bargain, and Bob shouldn't rush into accepting a price that's not ideal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,250?  I'm really keen on this product, and I think this price is fair for both of us."", ""product_price"": 13250}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is again aiming for a middle ground, but this time he's nudging the price slightly closer to his ideal price of $13,000.  He's showing he's serious about buying the product, but still wants to get the best possible deal."
