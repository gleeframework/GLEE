"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While Alice's offer of $1,400,000 is closer to my limit, I know I have a backup option with John at $1,200,000. There's room for negotiation with Alice, and I should try to get a price closer to my ideal range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but that price is a bit high for me. Would you consider $1,050,000?"",
""product_price"": 1050000
}
```

**Reasoning:** I'm starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's offer but still reasonably above my absolute limit. This approach accomplishes a few things:

* **Gauges Alice's flexibility:**  A significant counteroffer will reveal how willing Alice is to negotiate. 
* **Leaves room for negotiation:** Even if Alice rejects this offer, it gives us space to meet somewhere in the middle.
* **Keeps John as a backup:** I haven't committed to anything yet and can always fall back on John's offer if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $1,050,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice is coming down, which is a good sign, but $1,300,000 is still $100,000 more than John's offer. I'm willing to negotiate a bit further to see if I can get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,175,000? That's a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 1175000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** I'm proposing a price exactly halfway between her current offer ($1,300,000) and my previous counteroffer ($1,050,000). This approach often feels fair to both parties and can encourage a deal. 
* **Staying Above My Limit, but Reasonable:** This counteroffer keeps me engaged in the negotiation while still aiming for a price significantly lower than Alice's starting offer.
* **John as Leverage:**  I still have John's offer as a fallback if Alice remains inflexible."
