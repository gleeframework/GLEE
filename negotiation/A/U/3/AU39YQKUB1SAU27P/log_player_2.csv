"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $14,000. I think it's a fair price considering its value. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Here's why:

* **Alice's Offer:** $14,000
* **John's Offer:** $12,000
* **Your Maximum:** $12,000

While Alice's offer isn't terrible, you know you can get the product for $2,000 less from John. By rejecting Alice's offer, you can move on to John's better deal."
