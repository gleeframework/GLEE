"I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10000. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $10000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $18000. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll love the product.",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still very interested in the product, but $18000 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider $14000? I think that's a fair price for this amazing product.",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $14000 is a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $16000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value. Let me know if you're willing to meet me at this price.",16000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. I'm still not convinced that $16000 is the best price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $14000 and $16000, so I'll offer $15000 for the product. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",15000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm willing to consider your offer, but I'm still not willing to give up too much. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $16000 and $15000, so I'll offer it to you for $15500. It's a small compromise, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value.",15500.0,Alice,7,
