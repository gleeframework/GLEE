# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I think it would be a valuable asset to you. I'm asking for $20,000, which reflects its true worth.

Alice's offer is way above my budget.  It makes sense to reject and start counter-offering."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

```"

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your interest.  While I understand your budget, $12,000 is quite a bit lower than what I'm hoping for. Could you meet me halfway at $16,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000

While Alice has moved closer to my price point, $16,000 is still too high.  I'll continue to negotiate."
