Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm selling this amazing product. I'm asking for $150 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. I'm aiming for the highest price, but I'm also acknowledging the possibility of negotiation.  This approach allows me to gauge Bob's interest and potentially find a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $150 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $120 for it. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $120 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum price of $150.  I'm going to try to negotiate a higher price with Bob before resorting to selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $120 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $135. This still allows me to make a profit, and it's a good deal for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 135}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $135 is still a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to pay $125 for the product. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While I'd like to get closer to my initial asking price, Bob's offer of $125 is still below my minimum of $150. At this point, it's more beneficial to sell to John and guarantee my desired profit."
