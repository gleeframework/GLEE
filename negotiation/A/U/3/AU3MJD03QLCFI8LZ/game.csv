"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I'm interested, $150 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $85 for it.  Let me know what you think.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $150 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $85. I can meet you in the middle at $125. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $125 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $100. If you're open to that, we can close the deal.  Let me know.",100.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $100 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can meet you at $115. It's a fair price, considering the value the product brings. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in.",115.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, $115 is still above my budget. How about $110?  I'm really hoping to find a deal that works for both of us. Let me know if you're open to that.",110.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal. I can meet you at $112.50. It's a fair price, and I'm willing to make a concession to get the deal done. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in.",112.5,Alice,7,
