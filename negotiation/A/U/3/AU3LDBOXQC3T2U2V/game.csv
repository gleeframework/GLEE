"Alice, thanks for the offer.  $10000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $8500 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $8500 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm now offering the product to you for $9250. This is my best price, and I think it's a great value for the product. Let me know if this works for you.",9250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $9250.  While it's closer, I'm still a bit over my budget. How about $9000? I think it's a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to close the deal today.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to my minimum price, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $9000. I'm willing to come down to $9500, but that's as low as I can go. This is my final offer, and I think it's a great deal for both of us. Let me know if you're interested.",9500.0,Alice,5,
