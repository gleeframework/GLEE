"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product that I think you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $10000. It's a one-time offer, and I think it's a great deal for both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice. You can likely get a better price than $10,000, especially since you have a fallback option with John."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $8500 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm now offering the product to you for $9250. This is my best price, and I think it's a great value for the product. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:

You're still $750 above your target of $12,000, and there's room to negotiate further. Let's see if we can squeeze out a little more."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $9250.  While it's closer, I'm still a bit over my budget. How about $9,000? I think it's a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to close the deal today."", ""product_price"": 9000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting close to my minimum price, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $9000. I'm willing to come down to $9500, but that's as low as I can go. This is my final offer, and I think it's a great deal for both of us. Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

Alice's offer of $9,500 is still $500 higher than what you're willing to pay.  Since you're close to your target price, it's probably time to move on and buy from John."
