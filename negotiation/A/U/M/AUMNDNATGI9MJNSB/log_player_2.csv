"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really value. I'm asking for $13000 for it, which is a great deal considering its worth. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $13,000 is a better price than John's $15,000, Bob can likely get a better deal by negotiating further with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I appreciate you considering my budget. I'm really interested in the product, but $13,000 is a bit out of my range right now.  I'd be willing to pay $11,000 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, and I appreciate your interest!  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price. How about $12000? That's still a great deal, and it leaves room for both of us to be happy with the transaction. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price to $12,000, which is still within Bob's budget of $15,000 and offers a significant saving compared to John's price. While Bob could continue negotiating, there's a risk Alice will reject further counteroffers and Bob may end up having to buy from John at a higher price. Accepting the offer at $12,000 is a good compromise and secures the product at a reasonable price."
