Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really value. I'm asking for $13,000 for it, which is a great deal considering its worth. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$13,000:** This price is a good starting point. It's higher than my minimum acceptable price ($10,000), but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **The message:** This message is friendly and sets the stage for a potentially profitable negotiation.  I highlight the value of the product to encourage Bob to see it as a good deal. 

This strategy allows me to:

* **Maximize my potential profit:**  $13,000 is a good starting point, leaving room to negotiate up to Bob's perceived value of $15,000.
* **Maintain a good relationship:** A friendly tone encourages cooperation.
* **Have a backup:** The option to sell to John for $10,000 gives me a safety net if negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I appreciate you considering my budget. I'm really interested in the product, but $13000 is a bit out of my range right now.  I'd be willing to pay $11000 for it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Rejecting Bob's offer:**  While $11,000 is better than selling to John, it's still significantly below my desired price point. 
* **Proceeding to the next round:**  I believe I can negotiate a higher price by making a counteroffer and continuing the negotiation. 

**Next Steps:**

I will make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my desired $13,000. This will involve finding a middle ground between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer."

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, and I appreciate your interest!  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price. How about $12,000? That's still a great deal, and it leaves room for both of us to be happy with the transaction. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer of $12,000:** This price is a compromise between my initial offer of $13,000 and Bob's counteroffer of $11,000. It demonstrates flexibility while still aiming for a profitable sale. 
* **Positive Message:**  The message maintains a friendly and cooperative tone, reiterating the value of the product and encouraging Bob to see this as a fair deal. 

**Strategy:**

This strategy aims to:

* **Find common ground:**  A counteroffer closer to Bob's offer increases the chances of an agreement. 
* **Maintain a positive relationship:** A friendly tone helps keep the negotiation amicable. 
* **Secure a better price:**  $12,000 is a significant improvement over selling to John."
