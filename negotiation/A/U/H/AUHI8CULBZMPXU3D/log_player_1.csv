Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm willing to part with it for $15,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** Starting at $15,000 leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. 
* **Confident Presentation:**  The message is framed positively, emphasizing value rather than just the price. 

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer.  I am prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters, but I won't go below my minimum of $10,000."
