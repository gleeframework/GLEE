"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a better deal, but $9,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $11,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  While $11,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $10,000. Would you be willing to come down a bit more?",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm willing to make one last concession, but $10,000 is still a bit too low for me. I can meet you at $11,500, which is a compromise between our previous offers. This is my final counteroffer.",11500.0,Alice,5,
