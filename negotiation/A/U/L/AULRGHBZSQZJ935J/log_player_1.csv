Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product for $11,500. I know it's a great fit for your needs, and this offer stands for a limited time."", 
""product_price"": 11500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $12,000, your goal is to see if Bob will pay more.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering a price slightly below your guaranteed price might make Bob think he's getting a deal.
* **Time Pressure:** Adding a sense of urgency might encourage Bob to act quickly. 

**Important:** This is just one strategy.  There's no guarantee Bob will accept this price.  You could:

* **Go Higher:** Start at $11,900 or even higher, leaving more room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Offer a ""Discount"":**  Present a slightly inflated price and then offer a ""discount"" to make Bob feel like he's getting a better deal."
