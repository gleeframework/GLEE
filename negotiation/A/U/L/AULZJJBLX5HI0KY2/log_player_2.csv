"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a great product that I think you'll love. I'm willing to let it go for $150. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is way too high. I'll try to negotiate a much lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $150 is way too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $60 for it."",
""product_price"": 60
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** I'm starting with a significantly lower offer than my actual maximum ($80). This gives me room to negotiate upwards and still get a good deal. 
* **Leaving Room:** By saying ""around $60,"" I signal some flexibility, potentially leading to a quicker agreement.
* **Direct and Polite:**  I'm being direct about the price being too high while remaining polite and expressing continued interest."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $60 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can let it go for $100. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is coming down, $100 is still significantly higher than both my budget and what John offers. I'll counter with a price closer to my limit to see her response."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down, Alice. However, $100 is still a bit too steep for me.  Would you consider $75? I think that's a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 75
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Closer:**  I'm increasing my offer to signal willingness to compromise but staying below my $80 limit.
* **Justification:**  By mentioning ""fair compromise,"" I'm framing the offer as mutually beneficial.
* **Testing the Waters:** This offer will help gauge how much Alice is truly willing to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $75 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to make another concession. I can let it go for $110. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer shows she's not budging much. It seems unlikely she'll come down to a price that beats John's $80 offer within the remaining rounds.  To avoid wasting time and potentially missing out on the deal with John, I'm choosing to buy from him."
