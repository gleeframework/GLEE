Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While it's a better price than Alice's initial asking price, Bob can still try to negotiate a better deal. He can counteroffer and potentially save more money."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $8,500 is just a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and it gives you a significant savings. Let's try to make this work.

Bob should reject Alice's offer. He's already gotten her down to $9,000, which is closer to his target price of $8,000. There's still room for negotiation, so he should try to counteroffer again."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, and I want to find a solution that works for both of us.  I'm willing to go down to $9,200 for the product. This is a very fair price, considering the value of the product and the savings you'll be getting.  It's also the absolute lowest I can go.  Let me know if you're interested in finalizing this deal.

Bob should choose to buy the product from John for $8,000.  While he could continue to negotiate with Alice, it's clear that she's not willing to go lower than $9,200.  This is still a bit more than what Bob is willing to pay, and he has a guaranteed option to buy the product from John at his target price."
