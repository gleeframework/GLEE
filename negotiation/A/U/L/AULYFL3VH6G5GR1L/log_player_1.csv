Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,400,000 is still a bit higher than what I'm comfortable paying at this point. I'm willing to offer $1,300,000 for the product. This reflects a fair value for both of us, and I believe it allows for a mutually beneficial deal. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000.
