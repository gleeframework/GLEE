"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,400,000 is still a bit higher than what I'm comfortable paying at this point. I'm willing to offer $1,300,000 for the product. This reflects a fair value for both of us, and I believe it allows for a mutually beneficial deal. Let me know what you think.",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. However, I still need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,350,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you and the effort I've put into acquiring it. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
