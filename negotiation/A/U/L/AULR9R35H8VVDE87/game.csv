"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to buy this valuable product from me. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $900,000. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $900,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $700,000 for the product, given its value to me.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more than $700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $850,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's still a great deal for both of us.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $850,000 is still too high for me. I'm confident we can find a better price that works for both of us. I'm prepared to offer $750,000 for the product. This reflects the value I place on it and allows for a fair profit for you. Let's find a solution that benefits both of us.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to find a fair price, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $750,000. However, I'm willing to compromise further. I'll offer it to you for $825,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's still a great deal for both of us.",825000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $825,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm ready to offer $775,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me and the profit margin you'll still have. I'm confident that we can close a deal at this price and both be satisfied with the outcome.",775000.0,Bob,6,
