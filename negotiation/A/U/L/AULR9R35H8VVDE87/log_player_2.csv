# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to buy this valuable product from me. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $900,000. What do you think?

Alice's initial offer of $900,000 is still too high. There's significant room for negotiation, and I want to see if I can get a better price. I'll reject the offer and counter with a lower price in the next round."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more than $700,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $800,000 is finally within my budget and is a significant improvement from her initial offer.  While I'd prefer to pay less, I'm starting to run out of time. Accepting this offer allows me to secure the product at a price I'm comfortable with before the negotiation window closes and I'm forced to pay John's higher price."
