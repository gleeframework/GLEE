,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm. However,  $1200000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $1100000.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement that benefits us both.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1100000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1300000. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings to you.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet halfway, but $1300000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm happy to come up to $1150000, which is a fair compromise considering our previous offers. I'm confident we can reach an agreement that benefits both of us.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that we're getting close to a deal, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1150000. I'm willing to make a slight concession, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for the product. I'm counteroffering at $1250000. This is a compromise that I believe reflects the product's value.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. While $1250000 is a step in the right direction, I'm still a bit higher than I'd like to go. To make this a truly mutually beneficial deal, I'm offering $1200000. This reflects a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price that allows both of us to walk away happy.",1200000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm not willing to budge from my previous counteroffer. I'm willing to meet you at $1200000, but I need to get closer to my target price. I'm willing to make a small concession, so I'm counteroffering at $1220000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value.",1220000.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, we're so close to an agreement.  I'm willing to meet you halfway on your last offer.  I'll offer $1210000.  This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away feeling good about the deal.",1210000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $1210000. I'm willing to make one final concession, so I'm counteroffering at $1220000. I believe this is the lowest price I can accept and still get a fair deal. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",1220000.0,Alice,9,
