"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that you're looking for a better price, but I have to balance that with the value the product holds for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to the value it holds for me. How about we discuss a price of $1,050,000?",1050000.0,Alice,3,,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your honesty about your budget. I'm willing to meet you at $975,000, but I need to get a bit closer to my target. I can do $1,000,000, and that's as low as I can go. Let me know if that works for you.",1000000.0,Alice,5,,
