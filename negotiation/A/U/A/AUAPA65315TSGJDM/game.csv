"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I'd like to make a counteroffer to purchase the product for $900000.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your interest in the product, Bob. I appreciate your counteroffer of $900000, but I'm afraid that's a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I get a fair price for the product. My counteroffer to you is $1200000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept.",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1100000. I believe that's a fair price for the product, and I'm willing to make that my final offer.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to find a mutually beneficial price for the product, Bob. However, $1100000 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving money on the table. My next counteroffer to you is $1150000, which is the highest price I'm willing to consider.",1150000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to make concessions, but I'm still a bit concerned about the price. I'd like to make a counteroffer to purchase the product for $1050000. I think this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product, and I'm willing to walk away if we can't agree on this price.",1050000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to find a price that works for both of us, Bob. However, $1050000 is getting closer to my minimum, but I'm still not comfortable going that low. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm not giving away too much value. My next counteroffer to you is $1100000, which is the same price I offered in round 4. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle this time.",1100000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make another counteroffer to purchase the product for $1050000. I think this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product, and I'm willing to walk away if we can't agree on this price.",1050000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that we've been back and forth on the price, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm starting to feel like we're not going to meet in the middle. I'm willing to make one final concession, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving too much on the table. My next counteroffer to you is $1080000, which is a compromise between our previous offers. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'm afraid I'll have to consider other options.",1080000.0,Alice,9,
