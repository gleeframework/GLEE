"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $850000. It's a fantastic deal, and I believe it's worth every penny. Consider it a premium price for the value it brings. If you're not interested, I'm confident another buyer will gladly take it off my hands. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","I'm not willing to pay $850,000 for the product. That's $50,000 more than what John is offering. I'll reject Alice's offer.
