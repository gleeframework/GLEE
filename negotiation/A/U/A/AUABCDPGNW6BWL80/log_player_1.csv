Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really enjoy. I'm asking for $175 for it, which is a great deal considering its value.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than John's offer of $150, hoping to maximize my profit. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** I'm not starting at my absolute minimum ($150) to allow for negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a friendly and encouraging tone to build rapport with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the product, but I can only pay up to $150 for it. Would you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer Meets Minimum:**  Bob's offer of $150 matches my minimum acceptable price.
* **No Need to Risk:** There's no benefit to rejecting Bob's offer and continuing to negotiate.  I'm guaranteed $150 from him, which is the same amount I would get from John. 
* **Time & Effort:** Accepting Bob's offer saves time and effort compared to further negotiation."
