,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $125 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $130. It's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit. Let's close this deal.",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to the price I'm willing to pay, but I still think $130 is a bit steep. I can do $127.50, can you meet me there?",127.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but I still need to make a decent profit on this. How about we split the difference and go with $128.50? It's a fair price for both of us, and we can finally close this deal.",128.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm still not sure about $128.50. I'd be willing to go up to $128, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at that price?",128.0,Bob,6,
