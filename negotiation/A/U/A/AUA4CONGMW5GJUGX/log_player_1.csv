Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000.  I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and the benefits it offers. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, you can aim higher with Bob. Starting at $1,500,000 gives you room for negotiation while maximizing potential profit.
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes the product's ""value and potential"" to justify the high price. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone is not demanding but rather invites Bob to discuss (""What do you think?""). This keeps the door open for negotiation if Bob counters.

This strategy aims to either:

1. **Secure a higher profit:** If Bob accepts the $1,500,000 price, you achieve a significant gain.
2. **Negotiate from a strong position:** If Bob counters, you have a cushion to negotiate down while staying above your minimum acceptable price ($1,200,000)."
