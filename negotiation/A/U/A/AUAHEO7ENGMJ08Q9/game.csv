"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am currently working within a budget of $800,000. Would it be possible for us to negotiate a price closer to this amount? I believe we can find a solution that works for both of us.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While $800,000 is below my minimum acceptable price, I'm willing to be flexible. Let's meet in the middle.  I'm offering the product at $900,000. This price still provides you with significant value while allowing me to cover my costs. I'm confident this is a fair compromise.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your willingness to be flexible, Alice. I appreciate your effort to meet my budgetary needs. However, I would like to continue negotiating for a price closer to my initial proposal. I am willing to pay $850,000 for the product. I hope this offer will be acceptable to you.",850000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued negotiation. While $850,000 is closer to my target, it's still not quite there. I'm willing to make one final concession.  Let's settle at $925,000. This offer balances your budget needs with my minimum requirements. This is my final offer, and if it's not acceptable, I'll be moving forward with another buyer.",925000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I've carefully considered your last offer of $925,000. While it's an improvement, I'm still aiming to keep the cost within my budget. I propose a price of $875,000 for the product. I believe this offers a fair compromise that respects both our positions.",875000.0,Bob,6,
