Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1500000} 

I'm starting with a high offer, aiming to maximize my profit. It's important to remember that Bob's value for the product is unknown. If he rejects this offer, I'll be prepared to negotiate further, but I'll always have John as a backup buyer to ensure I don't settle for less than my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my desired price, and even lower than my backup offer from John.  I'm going to reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round.  I'm still hoping to get a better price from Bob, but I'm prepared to sell to John if necessary."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $1,300,000. This is a compromise between my initial asking price and Bob's offer. I'm hoping that it's a price that Bob will find acceptable while still allowing me to make a decent profit. If he rejects this offer, I'll be forced to consider selling to John to avoid losing too much money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price. While I'd like to get closer to my initial asking price, I don't want to risk further negotiation and potentially lose more money. John offers a guaranteed sale at my minimum, so I'm going to accept his offer."
