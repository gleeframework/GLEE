"Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $90 is better than $100, Bob can potentially get a better deal by rejecting Alice's offer and counter-offering.  He has room to negotiate lower, as the product is worth $80 to Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 85}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to get the best deal possible. Since the product is worth $80 to Alice, offering $85 gives her a profit margin while still being a good deal for Bob compared to John's price of $100. This counteroffer leaves room for further negotiation if necessary."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still higher than Bob's ideal price, and he's already shown he's willing to negotiate. Rejecting this offer allows Bob to make another counteroffer, potentially reaching a price closer to his target. While buying from John is always an option, Bob can potentially get a better deal by continuing to negotiate with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 88}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has already shown a willingness to negotiate and has indicated he's aiming for a price closer to $85.  By offering $88, he's showing flexibility while still trying to get a better price than Alice's last offer of $92. This counteroffer positions Bob for a potential agreement without going too far below Alice's likely minimum."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $95 is higher than Bob's ideal price. While he could continue negotiating, the potential gains are shrinking with each round.  Given that John is offering the product for $100, it's more advantageous for Bob to buy from John and avoid further negotiation that might not yield a significantly better outcome. It's not worth risking losing the product to another buyer at a higher price."
