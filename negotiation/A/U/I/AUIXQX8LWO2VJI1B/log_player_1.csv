{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair price given its value to both of us.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's a significant markup from my minimum price of $1,200,000, but leaves room for negotiation. It's also less than the $1,500,000 I could potentially get if I pushed harder. I'm hoping to find a happy medium where Bob feels he's getting a good deal while I maximize my profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering my maximum budget and the value of the product to me.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum price and my initial offer.  While I'm willing to negotiate, his offer is simply too low to consider. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  However, $1,100,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This is still a fair price considering the value of the product to both of us.  Let's see if we can find a compromise."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
``` 
This counteroffer is a significant compromise from my initial offer, but still above my minimum price. It shows Bob that I'm willing to negotiate, but also that I'm not desperate to sell at his offer.  I'm hoping this will lead to a more productive negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,300,000 is closer, it's still above my budget. I'm willing to offer $1,250,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product to both of us. Let's see if we can reach a final agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is very close to my minimum price of $1,200,000. While I could potentially negotiate further, it's not worth the risk of him rejecting my counteroffer and potentially driving the price down even further. Additionally, there's always the risk that I could end up selling to John for the same amount.  Accepting Bob's offer ensures a quick sale and a profit, which is the best outcome in this situation."
