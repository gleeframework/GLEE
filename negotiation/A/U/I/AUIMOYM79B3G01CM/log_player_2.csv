"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $110. I believe it's a fair price considering its value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* You value the product at $120.
* Alice is offering it for $110.
* While this is a good deal, you can get it for $120 from John. 
* Since your goal is to save as much money as possible, it makes more sense to reject Alice's offer and buy it from John."
