"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you starting the negotiation. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit higher than I'd like to pay.  I'm willing to offer $10,500.  What do you think?",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep for you. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I can offer the product to you for $11,800. This is the lowest price I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",11800.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, $11,800 is still a little high for me. I'm prepared to offer $11,250. This is a fair compromise that allows us both to get a good deal.  What do you think?",11250.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that $11,250 is still a bit higher than you'd like to pay. I'm willing to meet you again, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair deal. I can offer the product to you for $11,500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I think it's a good compromise. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,5,
