Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it's worth $175. Would you be interested in buying it for that price?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($150) but lower than what I think it's truly worth. This gives Bob room to negotiate.
* **Clear and Friendly:** The message is concise, friendly, and directly states the price. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** By offering a price higher than Bob's perceived value, it encourages him to make a counteroffer. This allows us to find a middle ground. 

This approach balances the need to maximize profit with the reality that Bob might not accept a very high price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:**  $120 is less than my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Potential for a better deal:**  While $150 from John is a guaranteed sale, there's still potential to get closer to my desired price by counteroffering Bob.
* **Negotiation Strategy:** Rejecting Bob's offer keeps the negotiation alive and gives me control. 

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can counteroffer with a price closer to my desired range, potentially leading to a more profitable sale."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $120 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $140.  This would be a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 140}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a price that's closer to Bob's offer, but still above my minimum. This shows willingness to negotiate while maintaining a profitable margin.
* **Highlighting Value:** The message emphasizes the product's value, justifying the price. This might persuade Bob to consider the offer more seriously.
* **Open to Further Negotiation:** The message ends with an open question, leaving room for further discussion and potential compromise if necessary. 

This counteroffer aims to find a middle ground that benefits both parties and potentially leads to a successful sale."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I think $140 is a bit too high. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $130. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:**  Bob's offer of $130 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Risk of Further Negotiation:**  If I reject Bob's offer and counter again, there's a risk he might walk away, leaving me with nothing.
* **Guaranteed Profit:** John offers a guaranteed $150, which is a safer and more profitable option at this point.

While I'd prefer to get closer to my desired price, the risk of losing Bob as a buyer and ending up with nothing outweighs the potential for a slightly higher price.  Selling to John ensures a guaranteed profit and minimizes the risk of further negotiation."
