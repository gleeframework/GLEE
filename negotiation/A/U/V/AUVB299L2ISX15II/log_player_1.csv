Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000.  It's in great condition and worth a lot to you, so I think this is a fair price.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $14,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $13,000 for the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $13,000 is closer to my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to go that low yet. How about we meet in the middle at $13,500? This is still a great deal for you, and it gives me a bit more of the value I'm looking for."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to get a good price, and I'm willing to compromise. How about we settle on $13,250? This is closer to your offer and still within my budget. Let's make this happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I'd prefer a slightly higher price, $13,250 is a good compromise and ensures I get a decent profit.  It's also better than selling to John for $12,000."
