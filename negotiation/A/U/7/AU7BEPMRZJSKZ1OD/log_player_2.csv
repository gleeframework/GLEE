"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

$500,000 is a very good price, but it's still worth seeing if Alice is willing to go lower. There are 9 rounds left to negotiate, so there's plenty of time to explore a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significantly lower counteroffer to gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate.  $300,000 is a very low price, but it gives me a starting point to see how far Alice is willing to go.  If she rejects this, I can adjust my counteroffer upwards in subsequent rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $400,000 is a good price, I believe there's still room for negotiation.  Alice has already shown a willingness to come down from her initial price, and I have 7 rounds left to potentially secure a better deal.  I'll continue to counteroffer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 350000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer to $350,000. This is a compromise between my previous offer and Alice's most recent offer. I believe this is a reasonable price that might be acceptable to Alice. If she rejects this, I will continue to increase my offers in subsequent rounds, but I want to see if this price point will start to move her closer to a deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $450,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $450,000 is a good price, I'm still hopeful we can reach a lower price. I have 5 rounds left to negotiate and I want to try and get as close to my initial offer as possible. Alice has shown a willingness to negotiate, and I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 400000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer again to $400,000, which is right in the middle of Alice's previous offer and my last one. This shows that I'm willing to meet halfway and hopefully signals to Alice that we're getting close to an agreement.  We have 4 rounds remaining, so there's still time to reach a deal if she's willing to compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $475,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $475,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly not going to go any lower than $475,000.  We are nearing the end of the negotiation process with only 3 rounds left.  While I'd love to get it for $400,000, I'm confident I can't get a better deal from Alice.  Accepting this offer is a good outcome, saving me over $700,000 compared to buying from John."
