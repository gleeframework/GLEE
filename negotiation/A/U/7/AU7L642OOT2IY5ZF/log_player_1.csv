Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your enthusiasm, $2,300,000 is significantly above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,700,000 for this product, given its value to me. I'm confident this is a fair price that benefits both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,700,000

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility and willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,925,000 is still out of my price range. I'm prepared to pay $1,875,000, which is a fair price given our previous discussions. I hope we can reach an agreement at this point.

While I could push for more, accepting Bob's offer of $1,875,000 makes the most sense at this stage:

* **Significant Profit:**  This price still represents a substantial profit over my minimum ($1,500,000).
* **Time Value:**  Closing the deal now avoids the risk of prolonged negotiations and the possibility of Bob walking away. 
* **Opportunity Cost:**  Continuing to negotiate risks losing a good offer. John's offer of $1,500,000 is now less appealing compared to Bob's current offer."
