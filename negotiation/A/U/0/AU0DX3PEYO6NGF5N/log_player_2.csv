"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better offer anywhere else. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $12,000 is a good price, Bob can potentially get a better deal by counter-offering."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $10,000 is your best offer, but I'm still a bit hesitant to sell it to you at that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11,500. This is a fair compromise, and I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
Bob should accept Alice's offer. $11,500 is a good price, as it's a significant saving compared to buying from John for $15,000. While he could potentially negotiate further, the risk of Alice rejecting his counteroffer and ending up with no deal is high. Accepting this offer is the safest and most financially beneficial option for Bob at this point."
