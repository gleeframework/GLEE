"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic product that I believe would be incredibly valuable to you. Given its potential, I'm offering it at $1,300,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Bob should reject the offer. While it's a lower price than John's, it's still higher than Alice's likely minimum. Bob can likely get a better deal by counteroffering."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your desire for a lower price, but the value this product brings is truly significant.  Let's meet in the middle â€“ how about $1,200,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  He's already gotten the price down significantly from her initial offer and from John's offer. There's a good chance she won't go lower, so accepting is the best choice to maximize savings."
