"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal, considering its value to you is $10,000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 might be a bit steep, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10,500. This is a fair compromise, considering its value to you. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While I see the value, $10,500 is still a bit over my budget. Could we settle at $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $10,500 might still be a stretch for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $9,800. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",9800.0,Alice,5,
