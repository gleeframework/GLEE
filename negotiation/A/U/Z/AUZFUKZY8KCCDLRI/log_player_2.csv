"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth more than $80 to us, but considering its value to you, we're open to discussing a fair price. Let's aim for something around $95. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 Alice's starting offer is quite high, considering her own valuation of the product. There's a good chance to negotiate a much better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. However, $95 seems a bit steep for me. I'm interested, but I'd be more comfortable with a price closer to $70. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 70
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  Negotiation often benefits from starting with a lower counteroffer than your target price. This leaves room for negotiation and signals that Alice's initial price is unacceptable.
* **Polite but Firm:** The message remains polite and expresses continued interest in the product, fostering a positive negotiation environment.
* **Strategic Positioning:** By countering with $70, we aim to bring Alice closer to her valuation of $80 while still leaving room for us to potentially reach a price below our $100 limit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your response, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your interest in our product. To find common ground, let's consider a price of $85. This still allows us to maintain a reasonable profit while being competitive. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is moving closer to her valuation, but we still have room for negotiation. Accepting $85 would be a decent deal, but we can likely get it lower.  It's worth another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. How about we meet in the middle at $75? That feels like a fair compromise to me."",
""product_price"": 75
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:**  A common negotiation tactic is to propose a price that splits the difference between the last two offers. This makes the offer seem more appealing and reasonable to the other party.
* **Targeting a Win-Win:**  Offering $75 gives Alice a small profit over her valuation while keeping us well below our $100 limit. This price point aims for a mutually beneficial agreement. 
* **Conveying Urgency:** As we progress through rounds, implying some urgency to reach a deal can encourage Alice to be more flexible."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thank you for your willingness to negotiate. Considering the value of the product and our goal to achieve a satisfactory price, how about we settle on $82? This would allow us to maintain a decent margin while remaining competitive. I hope this proposal works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $82. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $82
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Favorable Price:** $82 is a good price, especially considering Alice's valuation of $80. It's unlikely we can get it much lower without risking her walking away from the deal.
* **Time Investment:** We've already spent several rounds negotiating, and while we could try to push further, the potential savings might not be worth the additional time and effort.
* **Alternative Option:**  John's offer of $100 serves as a good fallback, but we're saving a significant amount by accepting Alice's current offer.

Overall, accepting $82 represents a solid deal for us and a successful negotiation."
