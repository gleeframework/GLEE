"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique and valuable product. I think you'll really love it. Would you like to make an offer for it?",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I can only go up to $8000 at this time.  Let me know what you think.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $8000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to negotiate. I can offer you a discount, but I need to make sure I'm still making a profit. How about we meet in the middle at $16000?",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $16000 is still a bit high for me. How about we split the difference and go with $12000? That feels like a fair compromise.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I was thinking more along the lines of $14000. It's still a bit below my initial price, but I'm willing to compromise. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm happy to see we're getting closer. While $14000 is a step in the right direction, I'm still trying to stay within my budget. How about we meet at $13000?  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",13000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to accepting your offer, Bob! However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go all the way down to $13000. How about we meet at $14500? I think that's a fair price that balances out the value of the product and my desired profit.",14500.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $14500 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $13500. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",13500.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal, Bob! However, I'm still not comfortable going below $14000. How about we meet at $14250? It's a small concession from my previous offer, but I think it's worth it to get a deal done.",14250.0,Alice,9,
