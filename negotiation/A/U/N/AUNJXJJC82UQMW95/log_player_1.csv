I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This is a good starting point as it gives me some room to negotiate downwards if necessary.  However, it's also high enough to hopefully generate a good profit.  I'll keep an eye on Bob's response and adjust my strategy based on his counteroffers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $12,000 is better than selling to John, it's still lower than my desired price. I believe I can get closer to my target by continuing the negotiation with Bob.  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
```

I'm going to counteroffer Bob with $13,500. This is a compromise, but it still reflects the value I place on the product. I'm hoping this offer will be appealing enough for Bob to accept, but I'm prepared to negotiate further if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While I was hoping for a slightly higher price, $13,000 is a decent profit and is significantly more than what I would get from John.  It's time to finalize the deal and move on."
