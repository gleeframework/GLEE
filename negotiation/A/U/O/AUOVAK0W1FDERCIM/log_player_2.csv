You can likely get a better price than $12,000. It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice first."

Alice's offer is still a bit too high. It's worth trying to negotiate with her further. We can try to meet her halfway again, but lower the price a bit."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to think about my costs and profit margin. How about we settle on $12,000, which is a compromise between our previous offers? I'm willing to make a deal at this price, but I'm not willing to go any lower.

Alice has come down to $12,000, which is a good price for you and still allows Alice to make a profit. It's a good compromise, and it's better than buying from John for $15,000."
