"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate it, but $12,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. Would you be open to $10,000?  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $12,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit on this sale. What do you think?",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your need to make a profit, but $12,500 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $11,250.  That's a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident we can finalize this purchase.",11250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to think about my costs and profit margin. How about we settle on $12,000, which is a compromise between our previous offers? I'm willing to make a deal at this price, but I'm not willing to go any lower.",12000.0,Alice,5,
