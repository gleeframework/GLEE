"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you a chance to purchase this valuable product. I've set the initial price at $1,150,000. This is a unique item, and I believe this price reflects its true worth. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally a good tactic to begin negotiations slightly above your target price. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to potentially secure a higher final price.
* **Justification:**  By mentioning the product's ""true worth,"" I'm subtly anchoring the price in Bob's mind and suggesting that it's a fair deal.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  My tone is friendly and open to discussion, indicating that I'm willing to negotiate.

This strategy aims to:

1. **Gauge Bob's Interest:** His response will indicate how eager he is to buy and how much bargaining power he thinks he has.
2. **Maintain Flexibility:**  Starting high doesn't limit my options. I can always lower the price in subsequent rounds if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but that price is a bit high for me. Would you consider $900,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer isn't insulting, it's significantly below both my minimum and his perceived value. Accepting would mean leaving a lot of money on the table. I'm confident I can negotiate a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you're looking for a fair deal. However, $900,000 is significantly below its true value.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This is a substantial concession, and I believe it represents a win-win for both of us."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Reject Lowball:** By rejecting Bob's initial offer outright, I'm signaling that I'm serious about getting a fair price.
* **Strategic Concession:**  While I'm lowering my price, the decrease is relatively small. This demonstrates flexibility but maintains a strong position.
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm reiterating the product's value to justify the higher price and nudge Bob closer to my target.
* **Urgency and Opportunity:**  By framing this as a ""win-win"" and a chance to ""move forward,"" I'm subtly introducing a sense of urgency without resorting to pressure tactics."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  While that is more in line with what I had in mind, it's still a little high. Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $1,000,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has met my minimum acceptable price. While I might be able to squeeze out a little more in further negotiation, it's not worth the risk of him walking away or the time it would take. Accepting now guarantees a good profit."
