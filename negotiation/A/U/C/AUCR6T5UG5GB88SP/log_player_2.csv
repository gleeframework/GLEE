"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,500. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $12,000. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  He can get the product for $12,000 from John, so there's no reason to pay more. By rejecting, Bob can try to negotiate a lower price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $12,000 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference and I offer you the product for $13,000? It's still a good deal for you, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000.

``` 

Bob should choose to buy the product from John for $12,000. While Alice's offer is closer to his desired price, he can still get the product from John for a lower price. It's not worth continuing to negotiate with Alice when a better option is readily available."
