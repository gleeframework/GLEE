{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,500. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $12,000. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 13500}

This offer aims to find a middle ground between my minimum value and Bob's perceived value.  I'm leaving room for negotiation, but still aiming for a good profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm only willing to pay $12,000. This is the maximum I can afford and what it's worth to me. Let me know if you're open to that price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $12,000 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to counteroffer Bob to see if we can reach a compromise closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $12,000 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference and I offer you the product for $13,000? It's still a good deal for you, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 13000}
