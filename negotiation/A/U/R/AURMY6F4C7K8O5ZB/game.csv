"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I appreciate you being flexible, but $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $1,050,000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering it to you for $1,075,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to get an amazing product at a great price.",1075000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,075,000 is still a little outside my budget.  I'm happy to meet you in the middle again.  I'll offer $1,062,500.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product to me and the fact that I'm ready to make a deal now. ",1062500.0,Bob,4,
