"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As a starting point, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a great deal, considering its true value is worth much more to you.

``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than John's, it's still above Bob's maximum price point. There's room for negotiation, so rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer is the best strategy at this point."

# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $1,050,000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering it to you for $1,075,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to get an amazing product at a great price.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your desire to meet in the middle, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $1,062,500. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to make another concession. I'm now offering it to you for $1,070,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,070,000 is still above Bob's maximum price point of $1,000,000. While there's still room for negotiation, the deal is getting closer to the 10-round limit. To ensure Bob gets the product within his budget and without risking further negotiation, buying from John for $1,000,000 is the most financially sensible option at this point."
