"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for a great price. It's a unique opportunity to acquire a high-value item that will benefit you in the long run. I'm willing to start with a price of $15000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $15,000 is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $8,000. It's too early to accept such a high price.  Rejecting the offer allows you to initiate a counteroffer and potentially negotiate a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product, $15,000 is outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,000, which is the maximum I can afford. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $15000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8000. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to offer the product to you for $12000, which is a fair price considering its value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is closer to my budget, it's still above my maximum of $8,000.  I'm willing to keep negotiating to see if we can get closer to a price I'm comfortable with.  There's still room for compromise, and I don't want to jump at the first offer that's somewhat reasonable."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $12,000 is still too high for me.  I'm committed to paying no more than $9,000 for this product. This offer is fair, considering the value it holds for me. I'm confident we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to think that we're getting a bit too far apart. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9000 and $12000, which is $10500. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and your budget. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $10,500 is still higher than my maximum of $8,000, but it's a sign she's willing to negotiate further.  I'll reject the offer and continue to negotiate, as there's still a chance we can reach an acceptable price.  If we don't find common ground, I can always buy from John as a fallback."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your effort to find a middle ground. However, $10,500 is still a bit above what I can afford. I'm willing to increase my offer to $9,500. This represents a significant compromise from my initial offer and is a fair price considering the value to me. Let's reach a deal."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to feel like we're getting close, but I still think $9500 is a bit low. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9500 and $12000, which is $10750. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and your budget. Let's see if we can seal the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $10,750 is still above my maximum budget of $8,000.  While we're getting closer, we're nearing the end of our negotiation rounds.  Given that I'm willing to pay $8,000 and John is willing to sell for that price, it makes more sense to purchase from John now and avoid further negotiation. There's a risk that if I continue negotiating with Alice, we might not reach an agreement within the remaining rounds, and I'll be forced to buy at a higher price."
