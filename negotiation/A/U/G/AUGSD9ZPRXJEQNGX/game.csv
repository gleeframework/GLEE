"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $130. I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I'm not willing to break the bank.",130.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $130 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little further, how about $135?  This still leaves some room for you to get a good value, and it's a fair compromise.",135.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $130 and $135, so how about $132.50? That's the highest I can go.",132.5,Bob,4,
