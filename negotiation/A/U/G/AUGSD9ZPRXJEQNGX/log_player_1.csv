{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $140. I think this is a fair price considering its value to you."", ""product_price"": 140}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $130. I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I'm not willing to break the bank. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'll reject Bob's offer. I can still do better than $130, and I'm not desperate to sell just yet.  I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $130 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little further, how about $135?  This still leaves some room for you to get a good value, and it's a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 135}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $130 and $135, so how about $132.50? That's the highest I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $132.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $132.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer. While it's not ideal, it's a good compromise and brings me closer to my desired price.  I'm not sure I'll be able to do better with more rounds, and I want to avoid selling to John at a lower price."
