Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer for Bob:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You won't sell for less than $1,200,000 because John acts as a safety net.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,500,000, meaning there's a potential $300,000 surplus to negotiate.
* **Information Asymmetry:** Bob doesn't know about John's offer, giving you leverage.

**Negotiation Strategy**

You want to aim high without being unreasonable and scaring Bob away.  Here's a possible approach:

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to offer you this exceptional product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm confident it can generate significant returns for your business. I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of the value it brings."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Strong Opening:**  You confidently state the product's value without directly revealing your minimum price.
* **High but Justifiable Price:** $1,400,000 allows you to capture a significant portion of the potential surplus while still leaving Bob with a $100,000 incentive to buy from you.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The language suggests you're open to further discussion, but you've set a strong anchor point. 

**Important Considerations**

* **Bob's Personality:** If you know Bob is a tough negotiator, you might start slightly lower (e.g., $1,350,000) to give room for negotiation. 
* **Relationship Building:** Even in a negotiation, maintaining a positive relationship is important for future dealings.
