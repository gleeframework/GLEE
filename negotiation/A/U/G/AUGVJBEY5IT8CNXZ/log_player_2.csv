"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the purchase of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a unique opportunity for you to acquire something truly special. As we start our negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $1,100,000. I think this is a fair starting point, considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still higher than Bob's target price of $1,000,000.  It's worth seeing if Alice will come down further. There are also 9 rounds left to try to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for your offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value you see in this product, I'm currently only able to go up to $950,000.  I believe this is a fair price considering my budget and the potential of this product for me.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at $950,000. Considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000, I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $1,050,000. This is a fair compromise, taking into account the value you see in the product and my minimum acceptable price. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still higher than Bob's target price of $1,000,000.  Bob can still try to negotiate a lower price with Alice, but should be aware that he is approaching his ""walk away"" price. It is still worth seeing if Alice will go lower, as there are 7 rounds left to try and get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I acknowledge the value you see in this product, I'm unfortunately still only able to offer $975,000 at this time. This is a significant increase from my previous offer and represents my absolute maximum. I'm confident that this price still allows you a good return on your investment."", ""product_price"": 975000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I understand that you're willing to increase your offer, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at $975,000. Considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000, I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $1,075,000. This is a fair compromise, taking into account the value you see in the product and my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between your last offer and my initial offer. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,075,000 is still higher than Bob's target price of $1,000,000.  While there are still 5 rounds left to negotiate, it seems that Alice is unwilling to go lower than $1,050,000.  At this point, Bob is better off buying the product from John for $1,000,000 and avoiding further negotiation."
