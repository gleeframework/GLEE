"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the purchase of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a unique opportunity for you to acquire something truly special. As we start our negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $1,100,000. I think this is a fair starting point, considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000.

"Thank you for your offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value you see in this product, I'm currently only able to go up to $950,000.  I believe this is a fair price considering my budget and the potential of this product for me.  Let me know what you think.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at $950,000. Considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000, I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $1,050,000. This is a fair compromise, taking into account the value you see in the product and my minimum acceptable price. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I acknowledge the value you see in this product, I'm unfortunately still only able to offer $975,000 at this time. This is a significant increase from my previous offer and represents my absolute maximum. I'm confident that this price still allows you a good return on your investment.",975000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I understand that you're willing to increase your offer, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at $975,000. Considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000, I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $1,075,000. This is a fair compromise, taking into account the value you see in the product and my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between your last offer and my initial offer.
