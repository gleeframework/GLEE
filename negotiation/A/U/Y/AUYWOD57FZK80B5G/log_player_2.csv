"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be perfect for you and I'm offering it to you for $20,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's initial offer is much higher than both your budget and John's offer. It's definitely worth countering to see if you can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is way too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider a price closer to $10,000.  What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** While $10,000 is significantly lower than Alice's asking price, it establishes a strong starting point for negotiation. This leaves room to negotiate upwards while staying within your budget.
* **Expressing Interest:**  Even though the offer is low, you want to convey that you're genuinely interested in the product and willing to negotiate a fair price.
* **Open-Ended Question:**  Ending with ""What do you think?"" encourages Alice to respond and continue the negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but $10,000 is significantly below its value. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need something closer to $17,000. How about we meet in the middle at $17,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above Budget:**  While Alice came down a bit, $17,000 is still significantly above your $12,000 budget and John's offer. 
* **Room for Negotiation:**  Her willingness to negotiate suggests you might be able to get the price lower with another counteroffer. 
* **John's Offer as Leverage:**  Knowing you can buy the product for $12,000 from John gives you a strong position to walk away if Alice doesn't budge enough."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $17,000 is still more than I'm comfortable spending. How about we meet closer to the middle at $13,500? I think that's a fair price."", 
""product_price"": 13500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Increase:** Increasing your offer to $13,500 demonstrates willingness to negotiate but still keeps you below your $15,000 maximum.
* **Justification:**  By suggesting you ""meet closer to the middle,"" you provide a reason for your counteroffer and make it seem more reasonable. 
* **Firm but Fair:** The language remains polite and collaborative, but also signals that you're serious about staying within a reasonable budget."
