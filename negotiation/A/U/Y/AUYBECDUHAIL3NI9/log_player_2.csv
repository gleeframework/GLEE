"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to show you this amazing product! It's a unique opportunity to own something truly special. I'm willing to offer it to you for $15000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject the offer. $15,000 is above his budget, and he can always buy from John for a lower price.  It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice to see if he can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer, but $15,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm really interested in this product, though.  Would you consider $12,000?  That's the highest I can go."", ""product_price"": 12000} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12000 is your highest price. However, I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you the product for $13500. This is a fair price considering its value and uniqueness. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's a lower price than her initial offer, it's still above his budget.  He should continue to try and negotiate with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $13,500 is closer, I'm still stuck at $12,000.  This is my absolute top limit.  If you're not able to come down to that price, I'll have to consider other options."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your position, Bob, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $12000. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer you the product for $13000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $13,000 is the lowest price she's willing to accept, it's still above his budget.  He should continue to try and negotiate with Alice, as he's already gotten her down from $15,000. He still has a few rounds left, and there's a chance she might come down further to meet his target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I truly appreciate your flexibility.  While $13,000 is a great price, I'm still just a bit short.  If you could come down to $12,500, we could close the deal.  It's the very best I can do."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your desire to get the best deal possible. However, I'm still not comfortable selling the product for $12500. I'm willing to make another concession. I can offer you the product for $12800. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $12,800 is close to his budget, he's still got a few rounds left and there's a good chance he can push for a lower price.  He's already gotten her down to $12,800 from $15,000, so it's worth trying to see if he can get her down to $12,500 or even $12,000. It's a risk, but it's worth it to see if he can get the best possible deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your continued efforts to work with me.  I'm very close to my budget limit.  If you could meet me at $12,500, I can close the deal right now. It's a win-win for both of us - you'll get the sale, and I'll get the product at a price that works for me."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to work with me. However, I'm still not comfortable selling the product for $12500. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer you the product for $12700. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,700. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,700
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should buy from John. 

He's been negotiating with Alice for a while and while he has gotten the price down, he's still above his target budget. It's only one round left, and it's likely Alice won't come down further. It's better to take the guaranteed lower price from John than risk another rejection and end up paying more than he planned."
