Round 3
Alice's offer:

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $105 might be a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $98. I'm thinking of offering it to you for $110. This is my final offer, and I'm willing to compromise. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

While we could try to haggle further, Alice has stated this is her final offer.  Getting the product for $110 is a decent deal and saves us $40 compared to John. It's not worth the risk of pushing further and potentially losing the deal."
