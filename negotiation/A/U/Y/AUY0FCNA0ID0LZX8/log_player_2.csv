"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hey Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be really interested in. It's worth at least $120 to you, and I'm willing to let it go for a price that's fair for both of us. What do you say to $100? Let me know! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

Alice's offer of $100 is less than your maximum budget of $120 and cheaper than buying from John for $120."
