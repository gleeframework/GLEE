Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a sample offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You won't sell below $1,200,000 because John guarantees that price.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is only worth $800,000 to Bob.
* **The Zone of Possible Agreement (ZOPA):**  There's no overlap between your minimum and Bob's maximum. This makes a deal difficult but not impossible.

**Strategy**

You need to convince Bob that your product is worth more than $800,000. This might involve:

* **Highlighting Unique Benefits:**  Does the product offer Bob advantages John's deal doesn't?  Focus on these.
* **Creating Urgency:**  Can you subtly imply other interested buyers to encourage Bob to act fast?
* **Framing the Value:** Present the price in terms of the long-term return on investment or cost savings for Bob.

**Sample Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this product before I move forward with other interested parties.  Given the [unique benefits your product offers Bob], I believe a price of $1,100,000 represents a significant value proposition for you.  This offer stands for the next 24 hours, after which I'll need to proceed with alternative arrangements."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Exclusivity:**  Creates a sense of urgency and importance.
* **Value Framing:**  Focus on the ""unique benefits"" rather than just the price.
* **Time Limit:**  Encourages Bob to make a decision quickly.

**Important Notes:**

* **Be Realistic:** It's unlikely Bob will pay significantly more than his perceived value.
* **Be Prepared to Walk Away:**  John's offer is your safety net.  Don't be afraid to reject a low offer from Bob. 

**Remember:** This is just one approach. You can adjust the message and price based on your understanding of Bob and your negotiation style."
