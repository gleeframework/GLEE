Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value, I believe a price of $1,500,000 is fair.  What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, you can afford to start high. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to maximize your profit.
* **Justification for the price:**  While not essential in this initial offer, vaguely mentioning the product's value sets the tone for a higher-priced negotiation. 
* **Open to negotiation:**  The tone is not demanding but rather invites Bob to share his thoughts, implying a willingness to negotiate.

This strategy aims to:

1. **Gauge Bob's interest level:**  A high initial offer can help you understand how eager Bob is to buy.
2. **Potentially secure a higher profit:**  If Bob accepts the initial offer or negotiates down only slightly, you'll earn significantly more than your minimum acceptable price.
3. **Maintain a fallback option:** If Bob rejects the offer, you can always rely on John to buy it at your minimum price."
