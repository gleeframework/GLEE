"Alice, $9,000 is a bit high for me. I'm really interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $8,500.  What do you think?",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more than $8,500. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell it to you for $8,800. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",8800.0,Alice,3,
