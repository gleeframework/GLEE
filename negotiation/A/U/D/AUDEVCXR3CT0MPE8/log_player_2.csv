"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,000. I think this is a fair price considering the value it brings to the table. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:

Bob should reject Alice's offer. He can do better.  He should try to negotiate a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more than $8,500. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell it to you for $8,800. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,800.

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  $8,800 is a good price for him, as it's less than the $10,000 he would pay John.  It's also a fair price for Alice, as she's willing to sell for more than her minimum of $8,000."
