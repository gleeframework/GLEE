{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice's offer is a good starting point, but I'm confident I can get a better price. I'll reject and counteroffer in the next round to see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to offer $700,000 for the product.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 700000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial price, demonstrating my serious intent to negotiate. It's still within my budget but leaves room for a potential compromise.  This aggressive approach will hopefully encourage Alice to consider a lower price."

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. However, I have to consider the value I've put into this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I can do $820000, which is a significant discount from the original price. What do you think?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is a step in the right direction, but it's still a bit high for me. I want to see if we can get closer to my initial offer.  I'll reject and counteroffer again, aiming for a price closer to $750,000."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down in price, Alice. I'm still a bit above my target though.  How about $750,000?  That's a fair price for both of us and would allow us to make a deal."", ""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm raising my offer slightly, showing that I'm willing to compromise.  $750,000 is a good midpoint between our current positions.  It's a fair price for both of us and leaves room for a potential agreement in the next few rounds."

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm starting to feel like we're getting close. I can do $780000, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. I've already given you a significant discount from the original price. If you're still interested, this is my final offer. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $780,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $780,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has stated this is her final offer, and while it's still slightly higher than my ideal price, I believe it's a fair compromise.  I'm also running out of rounds and don't want to risk losing the opportunity to purchase the product at a reasonable price. Accepting this offer ensures I get the product at a significant discount from the original price and from John's offer."
