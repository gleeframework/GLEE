"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  $900000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to offer $700000 for the product.  What do you think?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. However, I have to consider the value I've put into this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I can do $820000, which is a significant discount from the original price. What do you think?",820000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you coming down in price, Alice. I'm still a bit above my target though.  How about $750000?  That's a fair price for both of us and would allow us to make a deal.",750000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm starting to feel like we're getting close. I can do $780000, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. I've already given you a significant discount from the original price. If you're still interested, this is my final offer. What do you think?",780000.0,Alice,5,
