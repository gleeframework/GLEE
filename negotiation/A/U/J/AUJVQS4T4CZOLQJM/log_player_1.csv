Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $20,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 20000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations above your desired price. This leaves room for concessions and makes Bob feel like he's getting a deal if he manages to bring the price down. 
* **Gauging Interest:** This first offer is also about understanding how interested Bob is. His response will give me valuable information for the next steps."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value and the market rate. What are your thoughts? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly below my minimum acceptable price. While his counter-offer suggests he's interested, accepting $12,000 would be a substantial loss. I'll counter in hopes of finding a middle ground that's still profitable for me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the price. However, the value of this product is significant, and I need to be closer to $18,000 to make this work.  Would you be willing to meet me somewhere in the middle?"", ""product_price"": 18000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Concession but Firm:** I've made a significant concession from my initial price, signaling flexibility. However, I'm holding firm above my minimum to ensure profitability.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone suggests willingness to find a mutually beneficial solution, encouraging Bob to continue the negotiation. 
* **Middle Ground:**  Suggesting a middle ground encourages Bob to propose a higher counter-offer, potentially landing us closer to a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're looking to make a profit, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $14,000. That's my final offer. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While $14,000 is still below my initial target, it's a reasonable compromise. Here's why:

* **Profitable:** It's significantly higher than Bob's initial offer and keeps me well above my minimum acceptable price.
* **""Final Offer"":**  Bob's language suggests this is as high as he's willing to go.  
* **Time Value of Money:**  Prolonging negotiations with no guarantee of a better outcome could be costly. Accepting now secures a solid profit."
