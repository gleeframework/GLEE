"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10000. I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I need to stay within my budget. Would you be willing to meet me halfway?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're looking to stay within your budget, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $10000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $11500. This is a fair price that still allows you to save some money while also recognizing the value of the product.",11500.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, which would be $11000. Would you be willing to consider this price?",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $11000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $11500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's still a fair price for the value this product brings to you.",11500.0,Alice,5,
