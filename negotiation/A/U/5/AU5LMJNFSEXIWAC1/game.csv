"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your interest. However, $8,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. Considering the value of the product and my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price of $8,500. I hope this meets somewhere in the middle.",8500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob,  I value our back-and-forth, but  $8,500 still doesn't quite work for me.  How about we split the difference?  I'm willing to go down to $8,750. It's a fair price for both of us.  Let me know if you're open to this.",8750.0,Alice,5,
