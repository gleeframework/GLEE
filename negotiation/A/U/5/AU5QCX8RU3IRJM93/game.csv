"Hi Bob, I'm selling a fantastic product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth $10,000 to you, and I'm offering it to you for $11,500.  Let me know what you think!",11500.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I'm interested in the product, $11,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying.  I'm willing to offer $10,500 for it.  Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $10,500 is still a little too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $11,000?  This would still give you a good deal, and allow me to get a fair price for my product.  What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,
