"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $10,500 is still a little too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $11,000?  This would still give you a good deal, and allow me to get a fair price for my product.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000.
