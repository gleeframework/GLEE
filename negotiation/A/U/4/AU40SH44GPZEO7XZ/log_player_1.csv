"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,600,000 is fair.  What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 1600000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong opening:** Starting with a confident and positive tone sets a good foundation for the negotiation.
* **Ambitious but justifiable price:** Aim high initially. The offered price is significantly higher than both your minimum and Bob's perceived value, leaving room for negotiation. 
* **Open for discussion:**  Phrases like ""starting price"" and ""What are your thoughts?"" signal your willingness to negotiate and hear Bob's perspective. 

This strategy allows you to gauge Bob's interest and flexibility while aiming for a price that maximizes your potential profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me.  This product would be a great asset to me, but I need to stay within a reasonable budget. I'd be willing to pay $700,000 for it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly below both your minimum acceptable price and even his own perceived value of the product. Accepting this offer would be a substantial loss for you. While moving to the next round carries some risk, it's worth exploring if a mutually agreeable price can be reached."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and your counteroffer. However, $700,000 is significantly below its true market value and the value it would bring to your business.  To find a middle ground, I could consider $1,400,000. This reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your desire for a fair deal."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledge and validate:** Recognizing Bob's offer and desire for a fair deal helps maintain a positive negotiation climate.
* **Firm but flexible:** While significantly reducing your initial price, you're still aiming high above both your minimum and Bob's offer. This demonstrates willingness to negotiate while holding firm on the product's value. 
* **Justification:** Highlighting the market value and potential benefits to Bob's business reinforces the rationale behind your counteroffer.

This strategy aims to bridge the gap between your initial ask and Bob's offer while keeping the negotiation moving towards a mutually beneficial outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but that's still a big gap for me. I'm serious about purchasing this, but it needs to make financial sense. How about we meet halfway at $1,050,000? This demonstrates my commitment while acknowledging the product's value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is now getting closer to his perceived value, but we're still under our minimum.  While $1,050,000 is tempting, we have room to negotiate and see if we can close the gap further in the next few rounds.  We are aiming for a win-win, but not at the cost of a significant loss."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me to find a solution.  I understand your position and am willing to be flexible to make this deal happen. How about $1,300,000? This represents a significant compromise from my original ask and demonstrates my commitment to reaching an agreement."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledging progress:**  Recognizing that Bob is working towards a solution helps build rapport and encourages continued negotiation.
* **Significant concession but above minimum:**  Lowering the price by $100,000 shows flexibility while remaining above your absolute floor.  
* **Highlighting compromise:**  Emphasizing your willingness to compromise strengthens your position and encourages Bob to do the same.

This offer aims to strike a balance between securing a favorable deal and keeping the negotiation moving forward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer, but I still need you to move a bit more on the price. To be frank, I'm prepared to walk away if we can't find common ground soon.  Would you consider $1,150,000? This reflects the urgency I have to acquire this while respecting your bottom line. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Approaching the deadline:** We are getting closer to the end of the negotiation, and Bob is signaling increasing urgency. 
* **Strong offer:** $1,150,000 is a strong offer, surpassing our minimum threshold and representing a significant profit. 
* **Risk of losing the deal:** If we push further and Bob walks, we risk losing the opportunity to sell above our guaranteed price with John.

While we could try to negotiate a slightly higher price, the risk outweighs the potential reward at this stage. Accepting Bob's offer secures a favorable outcome and avoids the uncertainty of continued negotiation."
