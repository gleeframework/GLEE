Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000.  It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $15,000. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than my minimum, but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm emphasizing the value to Bob, making it more appealing for him to consider my offer.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm clearly stating that I'm open to negotiation, which encourages Bob to counter-offer. 

This strategy allows me to potentially earn a good profit while also keeping the negotiation open and giving Bob a reason to engage."
