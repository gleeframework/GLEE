"Bob, I understand your position, but $750,000 is simply too low for me. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and the time we've already spent negotiating. What do you say?",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $775,000 is still a bit low. How about we split the difference? I'm willing to go down to $825,000. It's a fair price for both of us, and we can finally close this deal. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,5,
