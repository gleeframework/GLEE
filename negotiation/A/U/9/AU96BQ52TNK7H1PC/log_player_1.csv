"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm willing to pay no more than $750,000 for the product. I believe it's a fair price considering its value to me. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still significantly lower than the product's value to me. I'm willing to keep negotiating to see if we can reach a price closer to my desired range."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $750,000 is simply too low for me. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $850,000.

```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $775,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While Bob is getting closer to my desired price, his offer is still lower than what I believe the product is worth. I'm confident that with a little more negotiation, we can reach an agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $775,000 is still a bit low. How about we split the difference? I'm willing to go down to $825,000. It's a fair price for both of us, and we can finally close this deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 825000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $790,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $790,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, but it's still not quite there. It's likely we won't reach a price I'm comfortable with in the remaining rounds. I don't want to risk losing the deal completely, so I'll sell to John for $800,000."
