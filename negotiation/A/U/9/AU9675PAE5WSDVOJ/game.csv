"Hi Bob, I'm happy to offer you this fantastic product. I believe it's worth $800,000 to you, and I'm willing to start with a price of $900,000.  Let's see if we can find a number that works for both of us.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm very interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $650,000?",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $650,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to be flexible.  How about we meet in the middle at $725,000? This price reflects the value of the product and leaves room for a mutually beneficial agreement.",725000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're getting closer! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we settle at $700,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I understand your position, but $700,000 is still a bit below what I need to make this deal worthwhile.  How about we split the difference and go with $710,000?  It's a fair price that gives us both a good deal.",710000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, you're really close! I'm willing to budge a bit more. How about $705,000? This is my final offer, as I need to stick to my budget.",705000.0,Bob,6,
