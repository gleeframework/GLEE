"I appreciate your time, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer and your interest in the product. While I understand your position,  $900,000 is still a bit below my desired price point.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000, recognizing the value this product offers to you. It's a fair compromise and a great starting point for a long-term partnership. Let me know what you think.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $925,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",925000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, and I appreciate your continued interest in the product.  However, $925,000 is still a bit too far below its true value.  I'm willing to come down a little more to $937,500.  This is a fair compromise that considers both our perspectives, and it would also allow for a strong foundation for a lasting partnership.  What do you say?",937500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm really stretching my budget here. I'm willing to go up to $915,000, but that's as high as I can go. I'm really hoping we can meet at this price.",915000.0,Bob,6,
