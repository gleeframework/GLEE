"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you the chance to purchase [Product Name] for a price that represents significant value. I'm sure you'll find it to be a very lucrative investment. I'm confident that this product will exceed your expectations. Let's discuss the details and finalize a deal that benefits us both.   
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer:** $1,400,000
* **Your maximum budget:** $1,500,000
* **John's offer:** $1,500,000

Rejecting Alice's offer and buying from John will cost you the same amount ($1,500,000). However, you have the option to negotiate further with John if you reject Alice's offer. This gives you more flexibility and potentially a better deal in the future."
