"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $18,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $8,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000

Bob should reject Alice's offer. It's significantly higher than his desired price, and he has a better alternative with John."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to sell the product for $10,000. Considering its value to you is $8,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll sell it to you for $14,000. This is a fair price, considering the value you'll get out of it. What do you think?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial proposal, it's still higher than Bob's ideal price. He should reject the offer and continue negotiating, aiming for a price closer to his desired $8,000."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $11,000 is still a stretch for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to sell the product for that price. I'll make one more compromise. I'll sell it to you for $13,500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to me is $15,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500.

Bob should choose to buy the product from John.  While Alice has made a concession, the price is still above Bob's desired price point.  He has a guaranteed option with John at $8,000, which is the most financially beneficial choice."
