{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a fair price, considering its value to me and the potential profit you can make.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

This offer is above Bob's perceived value of $1,200,000 but still leaves room for negotiation. It also demonstrates a willingness to compromise, which is key in any negotiation. If Bob rejects, I can adjust my offer based on his counteroffer or choose to sell to John for my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time and consideration, Alice. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,250,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

While Bob's offer is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum desired price of $1,500,000. I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, Alice. However, $1,375,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you at $1,300,000, but I really need to get closer to $1,200,000 to make this deal work for me. Can you consider that price?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While Bob's offer of $1,300,000 is getting closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit far from my target price. I'm willing to meet you at $1,325,000, but I really need to get closer to $1,200,000 to make this deal work for me. Can you consider that price?

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

Bob's offer is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  While I'm open to negotiation, I've already made several concessions and we seem to be stuck.  It's time to cut my losses and move on to a buyer who is willing to meet my price. I'll sell to John."
