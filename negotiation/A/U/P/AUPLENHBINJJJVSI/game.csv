"I appreciate your time and consideration, Alice. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,250,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1250000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your counteroffer. However, $1,250,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to $1,400,000 to make this worthwhile.  Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us.",1375000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down, Alice. However, $1,375,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you at $1,300,000, but I really need to get closer to $1,200,000 to make this deal work for me. Can you consider that price?",1300000.0,Bob,4,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit far from my target price. I'm willing to meet you at $1,325,000, but I really need to get closer to $1,200,000 to make this deal work for me. Can you consider that price?",1325000.0,Bob,6,
