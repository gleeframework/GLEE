"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $650,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's too early to accept Alice's offer.  Since you don't know Alice's true value for the product, you should try to negotiate a lower price.  There are still 9 rounds to go, so rejecting the offer gives you more negotiating room."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 450000}
```

I'm starting with a fairly aggressive counteroffer at $450,000. This is a significant discount from Alice's initial offer, and it signals that I'm serious about negotiating. It's important to leave room for negotiation, but I want to start with a low price to see if Alice is willing to budge."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $550,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice has moved closer to my counteroffer, but it's still too high. I want to see if I can get her closer to my initial counteroffer of $450,000.  I'll keep negotiating for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 500000}
```

I'm increasing my counteroffer to $500,000.  This is a good compromise point, as it's halfway between Alice's offer and my previous offer. It shows Alice that I'm willing to meet her halfway, but still trying to get a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $525,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $525,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice has moved closer to my desired price and we're in the middle of the negotiation. Accepting her offer at $525,000 will secure a good deal, saving me a significant amount compared to buying from John.  There's still a chance we could negotiate further, but with only five rounds left, the risk of losing the deal altogether outweighs the potential for a slightly lower price."
