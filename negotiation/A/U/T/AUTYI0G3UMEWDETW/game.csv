"Bob, I understand your position.  While $1450000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to come down to $1600000 to make this deal work.  This represents a significant value for you, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. Let's make this happen.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $1600000.  I'm still a bit above my target price.  I'm willing to go up to $1550000, which is a fair compromise.  I believe this is a good deal for both of us, allowing me to acquire the product and you to make a profitable sale.",1550000.0,Bob,4,
