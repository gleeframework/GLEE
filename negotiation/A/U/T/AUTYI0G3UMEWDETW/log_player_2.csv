Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position.  While $1450000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to come down to $1600000 to make this deal work.  This represents a significant value for you, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. Let's make this happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial offer, it's still higher than your maximum budget. You can potentially save even more money by rejecting this offer and counteroffering again.  It's likely that you can negotiate a price closer to your desired $1,500,000 mark by continuing to bargain."
