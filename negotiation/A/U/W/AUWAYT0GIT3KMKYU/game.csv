"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $8,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $5,000?",5000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to sell it to you for $5,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $7,500. It's a fair price, considering the product's value and quality.",7500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. While $7,500 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm aiming for something more around $6,000. Would that work for you?",6000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your target price, Bob, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for $6,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $7,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value and quality.",7000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. To be honest, $7,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go. How about we settle at $6,500? That's a fair compromise, don't you think?",6500.0,Bob,6,

"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $6,500. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $6,750. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value and quality.",6750.0,Alice,7,
