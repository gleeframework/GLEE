"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,500. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $10,000. What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! However, $9,500 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider selling it for $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I'm afraid $7,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product for $8,500. This is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you is $10,000. What do you think?",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. How about we settle at $7,750? That's a fair deal for both of us.",7750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $7,750 is a good compromise, but I'm still a bit hesitant to sell at that price. I'm willing to make one more concession and sell the product for $8,200. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. What do you think?",8200.0,Alice,5,
