Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $19,000.  It's a unique item and I believe it would be highly valuable to you. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 19000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($10,000) and my minimum ($15,000). This leaves room for negotiation and potentially a higher profit.
* **Justification:** The message hints at the product's uniqueness and value, aiming to justify the high price without revealing my bottom line. 
* **Alternative:**  Knowing I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000 gives me leverage. If Bob rejects the offer, I don't lose out.

**Important Note:**  This is just an opening offer. I'm prepared to negotiate with Bob based on his response and potentially lower the price to reach a mutually agreeable deal."
