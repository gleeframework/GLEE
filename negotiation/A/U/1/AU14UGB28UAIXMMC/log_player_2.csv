"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal, considering its value to you is $15,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the enthusiasm, but $12,000 is still a bit steep for me.  How about $10,500? That leaves some room for both of us to make a profit, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the product's value."", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand where you're coming from, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,500. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer you the product for $11,500. This is still a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $15,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:** $11,500 is cheaper than $15,000.
* **There's limited room for negotiation:** Bob's initial offer was $10,500, and Alice countered with $11,500.  Pushing further risks losing the deal and having to buy from John at a higher price. 
* **Alice is motivated to sell:**  She's already met Bob halfway, showing a willingness to compromise.

Accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product at a good price without risking a breakdown in negotiations."
