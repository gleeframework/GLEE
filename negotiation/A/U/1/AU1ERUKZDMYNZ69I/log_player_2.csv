{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's still room for negotiation.  As Bob, my goal is to save as much money as possible. Rejecting the offer allows me to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $1050000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to compromise. I can meet you halfway at $1175000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,175,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,175,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to my counteroffer and has indicated it's her final offer.  At $1,175,000, I'm still saving a significant amount compared to John's price.  While I could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice will walk away, leaving me with only John's option. It's best to accept her offer and secure the product at a good price."
