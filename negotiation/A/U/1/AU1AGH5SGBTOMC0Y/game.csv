"Hello Bob, I believe this product would be incredibly valuable for you, and I'm happy to discuss a deal. To start, I propose a price of $2,000,000.  I'm confident this price reflects the true value and potential it holds.",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the opening offer. That price is a bit too high for me. I'm thinking more along the lines of $600,000 for the product.  What do you think?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your position, but $600,000 is significantly below its true value.  To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,750,000. This offer takes into account the immense potential and benefits this product holds for your business.",1750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but that's still a long way from what I'm willing to pay. To be completely transparent, my budget for this is closer to $700,000. If you're able to work within that range, I'm very interested in making a deal.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I need to be fair to the value of this product. Let's meet in the middle â€“ how about $1,450,000? This offer represents a significant discount from my initial asking price and ensures you're getting a great deal on a valuable asset.",1450000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer but we're still quite far apart. I'm willing to increase my offer to $800,000, but that's my absolute limit.  If this works for you, I'm ready to close the deal today.",800000.0,Bob,6,
