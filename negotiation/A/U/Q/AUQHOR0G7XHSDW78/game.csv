"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,500. I'm interested in the product, but I'd like to get it for a better price.",12500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $12,500 is tempting, I need to make a bit more on this product. Let's split the difference - how about $13,250? It's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my target price.",13250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my target price. How about we meet in the middle at $12,750? I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget.",12750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see your point about staying within budget.  However, I'm still a bit too far from my desired price. Let's try $13,000.  It's a reasonable compromise and allows us both to meet our goals.",13000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to my limit, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $12,500. Would you be willing to meet me at $12,750 again? It's the highest I'm willing to go, and I'm really interested in the product.",12500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but I'm not comfortable going any lower than $12,800.  It's a fair compromise that's close to both of our desired prices. Let's make a deal and move forward.",12800.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $12,800 and my original offer of $12,500. How about $12,650? It's the highest I'm willing to go.",12650.0,Bob,8,
