"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this great product! I think you'll really love it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

``` 

**Explanation:**

* Buying from Alice for $120 is cheaper than buying from John for $150.
* Even though Alice is selling the product for a higher price than it's worth to her ($120 vs $80), it's still a good deal for Bob, saving him $30 compared to buying from John."
