"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

It's always good to try to negotiate and see if you can get a better price. Since Alice's offer is below your maximum price, it's worth seeing if you can get it lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 700000} 
```

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $700,000. This is a significant drop from Alice's initial offer, but it's still within my budget. I'm hoping to see if Alice is willing to come down a bit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

Alice's offer is at my maximum price. It's better to buy from John, who is offering a guaranteed price and I'm running out of rounds to negotiate."
