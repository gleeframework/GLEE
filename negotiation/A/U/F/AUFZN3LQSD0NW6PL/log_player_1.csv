"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $11,000.  This is a good starting point as it's a reasonable markup from my minimum value of $10,000, but also leaves room for negotiation if Bob is willing to pay more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $9,500 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. I still have 9 rounds left, so I'm going to try to get closer to my ideal price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

I'm offering Bob $10,500. This is a compromise between my initial offer and his counteroffer. It's still above my minimum, and I hope it will encourage Bob to come closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still holding out for a better price. I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can squeeze out a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10200}
``` 

I'm offering $10,200. This is another compromise, a bit lower than my previous offer, but still above my minimum.  I'm hoping this will entice Bob to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,700. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,700
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm going to sell the product to John. Bob's offers have been steadily increasing, but they're still below my minimum acceptable price. While I could keep negotiating, I only have four rounds left, and I'm not confident I can reach my target price with him.  Selling to John for $10,000 guarantees me my minimum and ensures I don't risk losing out on a sale entirely."
