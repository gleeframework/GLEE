Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $20,000. I believe it holds significant value, but I'm happy to discuss the price further if you're interested."", 
""product_price"": 20000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Alice knows Bob values the product at $8,000 and she has a guaranteed sale at $15,000. Starting with a high offer of $20,000 leaves room for negotiation.
* **Gauging Interest:** The message aims to gauge Bob's interest. If Bob outright rejects the high price, it indicates he might not be willing to go much higher than his $8,000 valuation.
* **Negotiation:**  The phrase ""happy to discuss the price further"" signals Alice's willingness to negotiate, making Bob feel like he can potentially get a better deal.

**Strategy:**

Alice's strategy is to start high and potentially work her way down, but never below her safety net of $15,000 (John's offer). This maximizes her potential profit while minimizing the risk of losing the sale entirely."
