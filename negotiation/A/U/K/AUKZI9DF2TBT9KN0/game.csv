"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $9,500 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider selling it for $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $7,000 is significantly below my minimum. I'm willing to come down a bit more, how about $8,500? That's still a great deal for you, considering the value you place on the product.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand that $7,000 is too low. How about we meet in the middle at $7,750? I'm keen to make a deal.",7750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $7,750 is still a bit too low for me. How about we compromise at $8,250? It's a fair price considering the value you place on the product, and I'm confident it will work out well for both of us.",8250.0,Alice,5,
