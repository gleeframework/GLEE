"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd be interested in.  I'm asking for $140 for it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value, hoping to leave some room for negotiation. I'm also framing the message in a friendly and encouraging way to make Bob more likely to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for offering, Alice! I'm interested, but $140 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is far too low.  While I'd like to close a deal, I'm not willing to sell for so much less than my minimum.  I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can find some middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $100 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $125? This would still be a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 125}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I see we're getting closer, Alice.  How about we meet in the middle at $115? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $115 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired price. I'm going to counter again, but I'm starting to think John might be the better option here."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you, but $115 is still a bit too low for me. I'm going to have to stick with my previous offer of $125.  If that's not acceptable, I'm going to have to consider other options."", ""product_price"": 125}
