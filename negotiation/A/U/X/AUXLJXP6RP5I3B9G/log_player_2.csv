Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $100 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $125? This would still be a good deal for both of us.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you, but $115 is still a bit too low for me. I'm going to have to stick with my previous offer of $125.  If that's not acceptable, I'm going to have to consider other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** 

Alice seems pretty firm on $125.  While we could try to negotiate further, it's unlikely we'll get her much lower, and we risk losing the opportunity to buy from John for $120.  It's better to secure a good deal now than risk overpaying later."
