"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1700000} 

I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum, but still leaving room for negotiation. Since the product is worth more to me than Bob, I'm aiming to maximize my profits.  This initial offer will gauge Bob's interest and his potential counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,400,000 is a good deal, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  I'll reject the offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

I'm counteroffering with $1,600,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer and closer to Bob's offer. I'm hoping this will entice him to accept while still securing a profitable deal for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Although Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm not willing to settle for anything less than $1,500,000. I will reject his offer and continue negotiating."

{""product_price"": 1500000}

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I've reached my limit with Bob.  His offer is getting lower, not higher, and I'm not willing to risk further negotiation.  I'll sell to John for $1,500,000, which is my minimum acceptable price and ensures a profitable deal."
