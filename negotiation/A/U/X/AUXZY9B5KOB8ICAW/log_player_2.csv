Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not quite ready to meet in the middle just yet, Bob. I can do $105, but that's as low as I can go.

At this point, it's better to accept. We're unlikely to get a better price from Alice, and waiting any longer risks her withdrawing the offer entirely.  $105 is a good deal compared to John's $150."
