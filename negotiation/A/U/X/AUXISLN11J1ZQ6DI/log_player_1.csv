"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1750000} 

I'm starting with a high offer, aiming to maximize my profit. I believe the product's value to Bob justifies this price. If he rejects, we can negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low.  While I want to close the deal, I'm not willing to accept a price that's significantly lower than my minimum.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000} 
```

I'm lowering my price slightly, but still aiming for a good profit. I believe $1,600,000 is a fair price given the product's value to Bob. If he rejects, we can continue negotiating, but I'm getting closer to my minimum acceptable price."

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a bit more.  I'm not going to rush into selling for less than what I believe the product is worth, so I'll counteroffer again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1550000}

I'm lowering my price again, but I'm getting closer to my minimum. I'm confident that Bob values this product enough to meet me halfway. If he rejects, I'll have to seriously consider selling to John."
