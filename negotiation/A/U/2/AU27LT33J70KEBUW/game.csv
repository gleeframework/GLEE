"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the potential of this product, $1,800,000 is above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,200,000, which is the maximum I can afford.  I'm confident this is a fair price considering its value to me.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1,200,000 is your maximum budget, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,500,000, but I'm not budging below that. I'm confident that the product's value to you is higher than that, and I'm willing to give you a chance to reconsider. What do you think?",1500000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,500,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $1,350,000, which represents a significant increase from my initial offer and is a fair price considering the value of the product to me.  I hope we can reach an agreement.",1350000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm glad you're willing to go up to $1,350,000, Bob. However, I still believe the product's value is worth more than that. I'm willing to make one more concession and meet you at $1,450,000. This is as low as I can go, and I hope we can finalize the deal at this price. What do you think?",1450000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice,  I understand you need to make a profit, but $1,450,000 is still beyond my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000.  This is a significant increase from my last offer and demonstrates my commitment to finding a solution.  Let's close this deal.",1400000.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad you're willing to meet me halfway. However, I still believe the product's value is worth more than $1,400,000. I'm willing to make one last concession and meet you at $1,450,000, but I need to be honest with you, Bob, if we don't reach an agreement at this price, I'll have to consider other options.
