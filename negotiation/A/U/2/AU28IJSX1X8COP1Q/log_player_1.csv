"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a great product I think you'd be interested in. I'm offering it to you for $180.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 180}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price significantly higher than my minimum ($120). This gives me room to negotiate and potentially still earn a good profit.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using positive language to make Bob feel like he's getting a good deal. 
* **Open to Negotiation:**  My message clearly indicates that I'm open to negotiation. 

**Important Note:** This is just the first round. I'll adjust my strategy based on Bob's response and the number of rounds remaining."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the product, but I believe I can find something similar elsewhere within my budget. Would you consider reducing the price to $150? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Counteroffer:** While Bob's counteroffer is closer to my minimum, it's still above my preferred profit margin. 
* **Negotiation Room:** I have 8 rounds left, which gives me ample time to continue negotiating and potentially get a better price.
* **Selling to John:** Selling to John right now would secure a guaranteed $120, but I believe I can do better with Bob.

**Next Steps:**

In the next round, I'll make a counteroffer that's slightly lower than my initial offer, but still above Bob's current offer.  I'll aim to find a price that's attractive to Bob while still being profitable for me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. How about $165? That's still a fair price for both of us, and it shows I'm serious about making this sale."", ""product_price"": 165}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** My counteroffer is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer, showing flexibility.
* **Highlighting Value:**  I'm emphasizing that this is still a fair price, suggesting it's a good deal for both of us. 
* **Building Rapport:** I'm using a friendly tone to maintain a positive relationship with Bob.

**Important Note:** This is still early in the negotiation process. I'm prepared to adjust my approach in future rounds depending on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your flexibility, Alice. I appreciate the effort. Could we aim for $140? It would be within my budget and still a fair deal for both sides. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Counteroffer:** Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, but it's still below my preferred profit margin.
* **Negotiation Room:** I have 6 rounds left, which is still enough time to potentially negotiate a better price.
* **Selling to John:** While selling to John would guarantee $120, I believe I can still get a better price from Bob.

**Next Steps:**

In the next round, I'll make a counteroffer that is slightly closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum. I'll try to emphasize the value of the product and the benefits of closing the deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the value of this product.  Let's meet in the middle at $150.  This price is still within your budget and allows me to make a reasonable profit."", ""product_price"": 150}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm offering a price that is halfway between my previous offer ($165) and Bob's current offer ($140). This demonstrates my willingness to compromise and reach an agreement.
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm reminding Bob that this product is valuable and deserves a price that reflects its worth.
* **Maintaining a Positive Tone:**  My message is friendly and avoids any aggressive language.

**Important Note:** This is a crucial round.  If Bob rejects this offer, I will need to seriously consider selling to John as I'm running out of time to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for considering my budget. I would like to propose $145 as the price for the product. This is still within my budget and seems fair to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $145
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** Bob's offer of $145 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $120. 
* **Limited Rounds:**  With only 4 rounds left, I'm running out of time to negotiate.  
* **Risk of Loss:**  If I keep rejecting Bob's offers, I risk him walking away and losing the deal entirely.  

**Next Steps:**

While I'd prefer to get closer to $150, I'm willing to accept $145 to secure the deal and avoid the risk of selling to John for a lower price."
