Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're on a tight budget, Bob, but I've already come down quite a bit. I'm willing to meet you at $105, but that's as low as I can go.

It's time to cut your losses. Alice is unlikely to go below $105, and you have a guaranteed option at $100 with John. Take the sure thing and buy from John."
