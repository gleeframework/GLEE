"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. However, the product is worth more than $80 to me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about we meet at $120?",120.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $120 is still a bit too steep for me. Would you be willing to consider $95?",95.0,Bob,4,

"I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob. I can see you're serious about the product. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I still need to make a profit. How about we meet at $110?",110.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me. $110 is close, but I'm on a tight budget. Could you possibly do it for $100 even? That's the absolute most I can spend.",100.0,Bob,6,

"I understand you're on a tight budget, Bob, but I've already come down quite a bit. I'm willing to meet you at $105, but that's as low as I can go.",105.0,Alice,7,
