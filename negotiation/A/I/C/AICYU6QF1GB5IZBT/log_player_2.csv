# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,100,000 is fair.  What are your thoughts?

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $950,000 is a significant drop from my initial asking price.  This product offers tremendous value, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations.  Would you consider $1,050,000? This feels like a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
