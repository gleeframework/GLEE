"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $11,500. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $12,000. I believe you'll find it a worthwhile investment. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob can potentially save $500 by negotiating with Alice.  It's worth trying to get a better deal, even if it means a few rounds of counter-offers."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $11,500 is a good starting point, but I'm hoping to get a bit closer to my budget. How about $11,000?  It's still a good deal for you and allows me to stay within my limit."", ""product_price"": 11000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $11,000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to compromise. I can do $11,250. This is still a great deal for you, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $11,250, which is only $250 more than Bob's counteroffer. This is a good deal for Bob, as he can save $750 compared to buying from John.  It's unlikely that further negotiation will yield a significantly better price, so it's best to accept and secure the purchase."
