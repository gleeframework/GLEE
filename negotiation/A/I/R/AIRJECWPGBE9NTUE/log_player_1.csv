Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $9,000, which is still below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000 but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Appeal to Value:**  I'm highlighting the value of the product to Bob, emphasizing that it's a good deal for him.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm making it clear I'm open to negotiating, but I'm not giving away the farm.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, great! I've made a profit.
* If Bob rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer. 
* I'll be prepared to counter again if needed, keeping in mind my goal of maximizing profit while still potentially securing a sale with Bob.
* If negotiations stall, I'll have the option of selling to John for my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I'm looking to stay within my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. Let me know if this is something we can agree upon. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:** While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum price, it's still below the $10,000 I'm aiming for.
* **Opportunity for a better deal:** I believe there's still room for negotiation. I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price by making a counteroffer. 
* **Avoiding a loss:**  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum price, but I'm willing to risk a bit more to potentially get a better deal with Bob.

**Next Steps:**

* I will make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to $9,000. 
* I'll be mindful of the fact that Bob is already close to his budget and I want to make sure my counteroffer is reasonable. 
* If negotiations stall again, I'll be ready to sell to John to ensure I don't lose out completely."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand your budget constraints. I'm willing to come down to $8,750 for the product. This price still reflects the value of this unique item, and it gives you a good deal.  Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 8750}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Closer:** I'm lowering my price, demonstrating flexibility, but not by too much. I'm aiming for a price that's still close to my target.
* **Fair Compromise:**  $8,750 is a midpoint between my previous offer and Bob's. It suggests a willingness to compromise while still maintaining some profit.
* **Maintaining Value:**  I emphasize the value of the product, reminding Bob that it's not just a simple price point but a valuable investment.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, I've achieved a good outcome.
* If Bob rejects, I'll carefully consider his next counteroffer, keeping in mind my minimum price and John's offer.
* I'll be prepared to make another counteroffer if necessary, aiming to reach an agreement that benefits both of us."
