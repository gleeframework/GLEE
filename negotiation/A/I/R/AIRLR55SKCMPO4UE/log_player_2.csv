"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You can get the product for less than $9,000. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price with Alice before resorting to John's $12,000 offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 7000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $9,000 is still too high.  Since the product is worth $8,000 to her, offering $7,000 is a reasonable starting point for negotiation. This leaves room for compromise and hopefully gets us closer to a mutually acceptable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $9,500 is still too high. While I am getting closer to my goal of $8,000, it's worth trying to negotiate a bit more before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $9,500 is still above the product's worth to her. I'm now offering her the product's worth to her, which is a fair compromise. This should be a strong counteroffer that she'll likely accept.  If not, I can still consider John's offer, but I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement before that becomes necessary."
