"Hey Bob, I'm selling this product for $90.  It's a great deal, and you know it's worth at least $80 to you.  What do you say?",90.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hey Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $90 is a bit too high for me. How about $85? That's still a good price for you, and I'm willing to close the deal today.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and $85 is closer, but I can't go that low.  Let's split the difference and go with $87.50.  That's a fair price for both of us.",87.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm still interested in buying the product, but $87.50 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  How about we meet in the middle at $86?  It's a fair price for both of us, and I can close the deal immediately.",86.0,Bob,4,
