"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth more than $120 to me, but I understand its value might be different for you. I'd like to propose a deal where you can purchase the product for $100. This way, you save some money compared to its perceived value, and I get a fair return for my investment. Let me know what you think!",100.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I'm looking to save even more. I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $90 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. After considering your proposal, I am unable to accept it at $90. However, I am willing to meet somewhere in between our values. How about we aim for a price of $95? This still allows for a reasonable profit for me while offering you a good deal.",95.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your willingness to meet in the middle, Alice, but I'm still looking to save a bit more. I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $92 for the product. I think this is a fair compromise considering the value I place on it.",92.0,Bob,4,

"I see, Bob. Thank you for your continued negotiation efforts. I've considered your latest offer and would like to suggest a price of $93 for the product. This allows us to find a balance between our respective values without compromising too much on my end. I hope this proposal works for you.",93.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to propose a final counteroffer of $88 for the product. I think this is the best compromise we can reach considering the value I place on it.",88.0,Bob,6,
