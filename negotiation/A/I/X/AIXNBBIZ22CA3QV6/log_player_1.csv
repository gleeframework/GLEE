{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,900,000. I believe this reflects its true worth, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations."", 
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, you can afford to start high. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially a much higher profit.
* **Justification:** Highlighting the ""immense value"" and ""potential""  justifies the high price, even if somewhat vague.
* **Confidence:**  Expressing confidence in the product's value can subtly influence Bob's perception.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Perspective:** This offer doesn't account for any specific knowledge about Bob's financial situation or negotiation style.  
* **Risk Tolerance:**  There's a risk Bob might reject this offer outright. You need to be comfortable with the possibility of selling to John for the guaranteed $1,500,000."
