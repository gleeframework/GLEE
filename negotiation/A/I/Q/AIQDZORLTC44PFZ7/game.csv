"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $20000. This is a great deal, considering its value is at least $15000. What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm really interested in the product, but $20000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $15000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $17500?",17500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to meet you at $17500. I'm willing to compromise and offer you a deal at $19000. This is still a great price for the product, and I'm confident you'll find it's worth the investment. What do you think?",19000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still not convinced that $19000 is the right price for the product. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I'd like to offer $18000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",18000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad we're getting close to a deal. However, I'm not willing to go all the way down to $18000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so I'll counter with $19500. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. What do you think?",19500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to pay $19500 for the product. I'd like to make a final counteroffer of $17000. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider buying from another seller.",17000.0,Bob,6,
