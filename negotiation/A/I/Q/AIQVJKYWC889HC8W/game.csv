"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to make sure it's a good deal for me.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to stay above $1,300,000 to make this worthwhile. How about we split the difference and go with $1,350,000? I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you. ",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,200,000 and $1,350,000, so how about $1,275,000?",1275000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your effort, but $1,275,000 is still below my minimum.  I'm willing to make one final concession to reach an agreement. How about $1,325,000?  This is a fair compromise, and it allows both of us to walk away feeling satisfied with the deal. ",1325000.0,Alice,5,
