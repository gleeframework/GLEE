"Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer, but $180 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $120 for it.  Let me know what you think.",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $120 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $160. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you say?",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $160 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $135.  This is a fair price considering my budget and the value of the product. What do you think?",135.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $135 is still a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $145?  This is a fair price that allows both of us to benefit from this transaction. Let me know what you think.",145.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm still not quite there with $145. Let's try $140. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can finalize this deal. What do you say?",140.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $140 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $142.50. This is a fair price, and I believe we can reach an agreement.  Let me know what you think.",142.5,Alice,7,
