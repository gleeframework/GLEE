"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering my product to you for $180. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $180 is way above your maximum budget of $120. It's better to reject this offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer, but $180 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $120 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 120}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $120 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $160. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $160
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $160 is still above my maximum budget of $120. While it's a better price than her initial offer, I can still try to negotiate further. I'll reject this offer and make another counteroffer, hoping to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $160 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $135.  This is a fair price considering my budget and the value of the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 135}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $135 is still a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $145?  This is a fair price that allows both of us to benefit from this transaction. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $145
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $145 is closer to my budget than Alice's previous offers, it's still higher than my maximum willingness to pay. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further. I might be able to reach a deal closer to my budget if I keep pushing for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm still not quite there with $145. Let's try $140. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can finalize this deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 140}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $140 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $142.50. This is a fair price, and I believe we can reach an agreement.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $142.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $142.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $142.50 is a better offer than Alice's previous ones, it still exceeds my maximum budget of $120. I've already gone through several rounds of negotiation and it seems Alice is not willing to budge significantly. I've reached the point where it's more beneficial to stop negotiating with Alice and buy the product from John for $120, ensuring I stay within my budget."
