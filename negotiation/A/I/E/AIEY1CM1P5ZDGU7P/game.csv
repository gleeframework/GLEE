"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I really like the product, but I have to make sure it fits within my budget.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9,000 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to be closer to $11,000 to make this deal work.  It's still a great price considering the value of the product to you.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand you need to make a profit, but $11,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $10,000 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $10,500?  It's a fair compromise that gives us both a good deal.  What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm not sure I'm comfortable with $10,500, but I'm willing to consider it. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. I'm trying to save as much as I can, and I'm not sure I can go any higher than that.",9500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find a middle ground, but $9,500 just doesn't work for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, how about $10,000? It's a fair compromise that allows us both to get a good deal.  We're close to an agreement, let's see if we can finalize it.",10000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I've already offered $9,500 and you rejected it. I'm not willing to go back to $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from $9,500, so how about $9,750?",9750.0,Bob,8,
