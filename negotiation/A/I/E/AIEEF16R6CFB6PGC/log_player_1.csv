"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $1,000,000. This is a strong starting point that leaves room for negotiation while still ensuring I get a significant profit. It's also a good strategy to start high and then be willing to negotiate downwards, as this can make Bob feel like he's getting a good deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $900,000 is a good price, I believe I can still get closer to my desired price point of $1,000,000. I want to see if I can push Bob a little further before considering selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

I'm offering $950,000. This is a compromise that shows I'm willing to negotiate, but it's still a significant amount above Bob's last offer. Hopefully, this will encourage him to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's getting closer to John's offer, I'm still holding out for a better price. There are still rounds left and I want to see if I can push Bob further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm offering $900,000. This is a significant compromise from my previous offer, but it's still a better price than Bob's last offer. I'm hoping this will convince Bob to finally accept and make a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

This is a tough one, but I'm going to sell to John. Bob's last offer is only $25,000 above what John is offering. There's not a lot of room for negotiation left, and with only 4 rounds remaining, I don't want to risk losing out completely. While I would like to get closer to my ideal price, the time pressure is pushing me to take the sure thing."
