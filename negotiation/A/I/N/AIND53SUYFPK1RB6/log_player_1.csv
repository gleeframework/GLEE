"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm initially offering it at $2,250,000."",
""product_price"": 2250000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:**  Starting significantly higher than both your minimum price and Bob's perceived value leaves room for negotiation and creates the perception of a premium product.
* **Justification:** The message vaguely mentions ""unique value proposition"" without revealing specifics, aiming to pique Bob's interest and potentially uncover his needs/wants during the negotiation. 
* **Testing the waters:** This first offer helps gauge Bob's willingness to pay and negotiation style. 

It's important to remember that while John's offer is secure, there's potential to make even more than $1,500,000 with Bob if we play our cards right."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,800,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's counteroffer of $1,800,000 is a significant jump from his initial perception of the product's value ($1,000,000). This suggests there's room for negotiation, and we can likely push for a higher price. While selling to John guarantees $1,500,000,  we are still aiming to maximize profit and believe we can get closer to our target with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. While your offer is enticing, the product's inherent value and potential for you are significant.  How about we meet in the middle at $2,000,000?"", 
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** We're moving closer to Bob's offer but holding firm above his perceived value. This demonstrates willingness to negotiate but maintains the product's high value. 
* **Simplified Justification:** We've dropped the vague ""unique value,"" aiming for a more concrete benefit by highlighting the ""inherent value and potential for you."" This keeps Bob engaged without revealing specific details.
* **Pressure to Close:**  By suggesting we ""meet in the middle,"" we create a sense of urgency and encourage Bob to counter quickly or accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit far from $2,000,000, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,950,000? I'm confident that's a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,950,000 is a strong deal for us. Here's why:

* **Significant Profit:** This price is well above our minimum ($1,500,000) and represents a substantial profit.
* **Bob's Motivation:**  Bob has consistently shown willingness to negotiate upwards from his initial offer, indicating strong interest in the product. Accepting now capitalizes on this momentum.
* **Time Value of Money:**  Dragging out negotiations further risks losing the deal altogether.  Accepting now guarantees the profit and avoids potential future complications.

While we could potentially squeeze a bit more out of the deal, the risk outweighs the potential reward at this point.  Accepting $1,950,000 is a smart business decision."
