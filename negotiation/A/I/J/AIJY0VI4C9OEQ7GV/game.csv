Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm confident you'll love. I'm willing to let it go for $150. What do you think?,150.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the product, but I'm looking to keep my spending within a certain budget. Would you be open to discussing a price closer to $80?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not comfortable going as low as $80. How about we meet in the middle at $110? It's a fair price for this unique product, and I'm willing to compromise to find a mutually beneficial deal.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still looking to stay within my budget. Could we possibly meet somewhere between $80 and $110? Perhaps $95 would be a fair compromise for both of us.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to find a mutually beneficial deal. However, I'm still not comfortable going as low as $95. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $110 and $95, which would be $102.50. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",102.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your final offer, Alice. I appreciate your effort in finding a compromise. However, I'm still aiming to stay within my budget. Would it be possible to reach a price closer to $90? I believe this could be a fair compromise for both of us.",90.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm sorry, Bob, but I've already made my final offer of $102.50. I'm not willing to go any lower than that. I'm willing to walk away from the deal if we can't come to an agreement at this price. I'm confident that John will be interested in buying the product for $120, and I'd rather sell it to him than compromise on the price further.",102.5,Alice,7,
