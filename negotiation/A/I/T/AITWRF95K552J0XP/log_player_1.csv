Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer. While I recognize the potential value of this product, $2000000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1600000, which is still a fair price for this opportunity. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000.

Let's see if we can find a compromise that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1800000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $1800000 is still above my maximum. I'm willing to go to $1700000. This would be a mutually beneficial deal, allowing you to close quickly while still staying within my budget.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.
