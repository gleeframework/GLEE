"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I recognize the potential value of this product, $2000000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1600000, which is still a fair price for this opportunity. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I understand your budget constraints, $1600000 is still below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm willing to come down to $1800000, which reflects the significant value this product can bring to your business.  Let's see if we can find a compromise that works for both of us.",1800000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, but $1800000 is still above my maximum. I'm willing to go to $1700000. This would be a mutually beneficial deal, allowing you to close quickly while still staying within my budget.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1700000.0,Bob,4,
