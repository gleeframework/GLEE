Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $99. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", ""product_price"": 99}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as much money from Bob as possible. 
* **Bob's Valuation:** We know Bob values the product at $80.
* **John as Backup:** We have a guaranteed sale at $100 to John. 

Therefore, offering the product slightly below John's price ($99) maximizes the chance of Bob accepting while still getting a higher price than Bob's initial valuation."
