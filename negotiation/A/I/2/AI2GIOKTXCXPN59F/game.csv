"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a unique opportunity to get your hands on something truly valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $15000. I think it's a fair price considering its worth to me, but I'm open to negotiations.",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice! While I appreciate the value you place on this product, $15000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $12000 for it. Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $15000 might be a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go down to $12000 just yet. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $13500. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in.",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $13500 is still a bit high for me.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $12000. If you're not willing to accept that, I'll have to consider buying from John.",12000.0,Bob,4,
