"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $9,000. This is a bit higher than Bob's perceived value, but I'm hoping to get close to my target of $8,000+ and see if he's willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $7,500 is a decent amount, it's still below my minimum target of $8,000. I'll reject his offer and try to get closer to my goal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
``` 

I'm offering $8,500, which is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. I believe this price is still fair and within my target range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob is still too low, and while I could sell to John for $8,000, I want to see if I can squeeze a bit more out of Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 8200}
```

I'm lowering my offer to $8,200. This is a bit closer to Bob's offer, but I'm still hoping to get a price above my minimum of $8,000.  I'm starting to feel the pressure with only 5 rounds left, but I'm determined to get as close to my target as possible."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offers are getting increasingly unreasonable, and we're running out of time.  I've reached a point where the risk of not reaching my target price is too high.  Selling to John for $8,000 is the safest and most sensible option at this point."
