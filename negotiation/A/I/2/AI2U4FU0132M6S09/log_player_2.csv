"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you might be interested in. It's something that's worth $100 to you, so I'm offering it to you for $90.  Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:** Buying from Alice for $90 saves you $10 compared to buying from John for $100.
* **The product is worth more to you than Alice:**  Even though you're paying $90, you value the product at $100, so it's still a good deal for you."
