Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1750000} 

This offer is higher than Bob's perceived value of the product, but it leaves room for negotiation if he's willing to pay more. It also sets a high starting point for potential counteroffers, allowing you to potentially achieve a price closer to your minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

At this point, it's clear that Bob isn't willing to pay a price close to my minimum. While I could continue negotiating, the time spent may not be worth the potential gain. Selling to John guarantees my desired price and avoids further delays."
