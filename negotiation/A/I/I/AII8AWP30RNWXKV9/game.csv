"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $10,000. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $8,000 to you. Let me know what you think!",10000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you being willing to negotiate, but $10,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm happy to pay $8,500, which is a fair price considering the value for me and the fact that you are also getting a good deal. What do you think?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your offer, but $8,500 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,500, which is still a good deal for both of us. It allows you to purchase the product at a price significantly below its true value to me. Let's see if we can find common ground here.",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further.  $9,500 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $9,000, which is a fair compromise.  This allows you to get closer to your desired price while still allowing me to save some money.  Let's close this deal!",9000.0,Bob,4,
