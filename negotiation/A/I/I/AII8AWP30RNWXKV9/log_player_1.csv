Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $10,000. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $8,000 to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $10,000. This is above Bob's perceived value but still below my minimum value. This allows for some negotiation room while ensuring I get a decent profit.  I'm also highlighting the value proposition for Bob, hoping to encourage him to accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you being willing to negotiate, but $10,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm happy to pay $8,500, which is a fair price considering the value for me and the fact that you are also getting a good deal. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $8,500 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum of $12,000. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your offer, but $8,500 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,500, which is still a good deal for both of us. It allows you to purchase the product at a price significantly below its true value to me. Let's see if we can find common ground here."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further.  $9,500 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $9,000, which is a fair compromise.  This allows you to get closer to your desired price while still allowing me to save some money.  Let's close this deal! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial desired price, Bob's offer of $9,000 is a good compromise. It's closer to my minimum value of $12,000 than John's offer, and it avoids the risk of further negotiation with Bob potentially leading to a lower offer."
