# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think you'll really love it. Would you like to buy it from me for $100? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer is too high. We can definitely negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $100 is a bit too steep for me. Would you consider $65?"",
""product_price"": 65
}
``` 

We're starting with a significantly lower offer to see how much room for negotiation we have."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob, but I was thinking more along the lines of $85. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is coming down, but we're still aiming to get closer to $80. Let's counter and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  How about we settle on $75? That's a fair price."",
""product_price"": 75
}
``` 

We're splitting the difference between her offer and our previous one. This shows willingness to negotiate while still striving for a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting closer to your price, Bob, but I'm still looking for a bit more. How about we meet at $82.50? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $82.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $82.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is getting very close to John's price, but we're still willing to see if we can get a slightly better deal before accepting. We are only $2.50 away from John's price, so the next counter offer is crucial."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, you're really close! How about we split the difference and make it $80? That's my final offer."",
""product_price"": 80
}
``` 

We're meeting Alice at John's price. This is a strong tactic, signaling that this is our best offer and we're willing to walk away if she doesn't accept. It's unlikely she'll get a better offer from anyone else."
