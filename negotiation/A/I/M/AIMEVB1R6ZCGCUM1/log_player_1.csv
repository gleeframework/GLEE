Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm proposing a starting price of $950,000."", 
""product_price"": 950000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm aiming high initially to give myself room to negotiate downwards while still staying well above my minimum acceptable price ($800,000).
* **Justification:** The message subtly implies the product's value to justify the high price, potentially encouraging Bob to meet closer to my asking price. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** By saying ""starting price,"" I signal to Bob that I'm open to negotiation and finding a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $800,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer matches my absolute minimum, I know the product is worth significantly more to him. Rejecting his initial offer allows me to:

* **Gauge Seriousness:**  See how committed Bob is to getting the product.  His next offer will reveal more about his willingness to negotiate.
* **Maintain Negotiating Position:** Accepting immediately might make me seem desperate. A counteroffer shows I'm looking for a fair deal.

I'm willing to risk continuing negotiations for a chance at a higher price, knowing I have John's offer as a safety net."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget considerations. Considering the true value of this product, I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This is a significant discount and a fair offer."",
""product_price"": 900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** I'm making a substantial concession ($50,000) to show flexibility and encourage Bob to negotiate further. 
* **Holding Firm:** I'm still aiming high, significantly above my minimum and Bob's initial offer, to maintain a strong negotiating position.
* **Value Emphasis:** The message again reiterates the product's value to justify the price and potentially sway Bob towards a higher offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering $850,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Offer:** Bob's offer is now a significant amount above my minimum ($800,000) and represents a good profit.
* **""Final Offer"" Signal:** His language suggests he's unlikely to move much higher.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Continuing carries the risk of Bob walking away entirely, leaving me with John's lower offer. Accepting now secures a very good deal. 

While I could push for more, the potential gain isn't worth the risk of losing Bob as a buyer altogether."
