"Alice, thanks for the offer. However, that price is a little high for me.  I'd be willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $1,000,000 is significantly lower than the value of this product.  Let's split the difference. I'm prepared to accept $1,150,000 for it.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  While $1,150,000 is closer, I'm still aiming for a lower price point. Would you consider $1,075,000?",1075000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to negotiate a price that works for you, but I also need to ensure I get a fair value for this product. I'm willing to come down a little further, but I can't go below $1,100,000. This is a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll see the value in it.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working to find a compromise.  How about we settle at $1,090,000? That's a fair bit closer to your price, and it would allow me to close this deal.",1090000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, we've been going back and forth, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm willing to meet you halfway on this last offer.  How about we settle on $1,095,000?  This is my final offer, and if we can't reach an agreement, I'll be forced to consider other options.",1095000.0,Alice,7,
