Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 140}
``` 

This offer is based on the following logic:

* **Bob's value:**  Bob values the product at $150. 
* **My value:** I value the product at $100. 
* **John's value:** John is willing to pay $100.

By offering $140, I aim to secure a price closer to Bob's perceived value while still getting a profit higher than what I would get from John. This offer leaves room for negotiation, but also provides a reasonable starting point for a mutually beneficial deal."
