"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but $150 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $120 for it, which is the maximum I'm willing to spend. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $120 is better than selling to John, I'm hoping to get closer to my initial price of $150. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget.  How about we meet in the middle at $135? It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to make a deal."", ""product_price"": 135}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $135 is still a bit too high for me. How about we meet at $125? I'm really interested in the product and I'm willing to pay a premium, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  While I'm getting closer to a deal, I'm still confident I can get a better price than $125.  I'll try one more counteroffer before potentially selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating with you.  Let's compromise at $130. I'm willing to come down a little more, but I'm also firm on the value of this product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 130}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $130 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $128 for the product. I think that's a fair price, considering the value you're offering. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $128. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $128
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While I'd like to get a bit closer to my ideal price, we've been negotiating for a while and I'm happy to close the deal at $128.  This is significantly better than selling to John for $100."
