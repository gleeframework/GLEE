"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": $1,200,000}

I'm starting with a price that is slightly lower than what I'm willing to accept, but still higher than what Bob is willing to pay. This gives me some room for negotiation and allows me to test Bob's willingness to buy."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's lower than what I'm willing to accept. I'd like to see if I can get a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""product_price"": $1,100,000}

I'm making a counteroffer that's slightly higher than Bob's previous offer, but still lower than my initial offer. This gives Bob an opportunity to negotiate further, but also keeps the door open for a potential deal."
