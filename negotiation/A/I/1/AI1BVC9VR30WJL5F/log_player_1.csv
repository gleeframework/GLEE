Round 2

I'm aiming for a higher price than $90.  Let's see if I can get closer to my desired price in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $90 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference and I'll sell it to you for $105?  Let's find a compromise that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 105}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100

I'm still holding out for a price closer to my minimum of $150. I'll try one more counteroffer to see if I can get Bob closer to my desired price."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but $100 is still a bit low for me. How about $102.50? That's just a small adjustment, and it would get us closer to a deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 102.5}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're trying to find a middle ground, but $102.50 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $98? I'm willing to make one more compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $98. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $98
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

It's getting close to the end of the negotiations, and Bob is still not willing to meet my minimum price.  I've already made several concessions, and I don't want to risk getting stuck with a lower price.  It's better to sell to John for $150 and ensure I get my desired value."
