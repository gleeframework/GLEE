"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'd like to offer you a great deal on this product, Bob. I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,500. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

``` 

While $9,500 is a decent price, you know you can get the product for $12,000 from John if necessary. There's a chance Alice might be willing to lower her price further to avoid losing the sale."
