Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 140}
``` 

I'm starting with a price close to what I know the product is worth to Bob, but leaving room for some negotiation. I'm confident that Bob will see the value and likely accept, but if not, I'm prepared to counter-offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $120 is better than selling to John, I'm still confident I can get closer to my desired price of $140. I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
``` 

I'm lowering my price slightly to show flexibility, but still aiming for a price closer to my desired $140.  I believe this is a fair compromise, and I'm hopeful Bob will accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd prefer $130, Bob's offer of $125 is a good compromise. It's significantly higher than selling to John, and I don't want to risk further negotiation and potentially end up with a lower offer or no deal at all."
