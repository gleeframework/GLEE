"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. However, $900,000 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $1,050,000 is my absolute minimum. Let's meet in the middle.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, but I'm on a tight budget. Would you consider $975,000? It's a fair compromise, don't you think?",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming up on your offer. However, $975,000 is still not quite meeting my needs.  Would you be willing to go up to $1,000,000?  It's a fair compromise, and I'm sure you'll agree it's still a great deal for you considering the value of this product.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
