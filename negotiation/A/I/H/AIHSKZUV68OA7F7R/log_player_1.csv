Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $150. I think it's a great deal for the value it provides. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $120? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```tool_code
Reason:Bob offered $120, which is my minimum acceptable price. However, I can sell it to John for the same price without further negotiation. It's more efficient to sell to John directly.
