Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $19,000. I believe it holds significant value, even exceeding the potential $10,000 worth you might already see in it. Let me know what you think!"", 
""product_price"": 19000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, your goal is to see if Bob will pay more. 
* **High Starting Point:** Starting with a price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($10,000) allows room for negotiation if needed.
* **Confident Approach:** The message emphasizes the product's value, potentially influencing Bob's perception and justifying the high price.

**Possible Outcomes:**

* **Bob Accepts:** You achieve a higher profit than selling to John.
* **Bob Negotiates:** You have room to lower the price while still aiming for a profit above $15,000.
* **Bob Rejects:** You sell to John at your guaranteed price, ensuring no loss."
