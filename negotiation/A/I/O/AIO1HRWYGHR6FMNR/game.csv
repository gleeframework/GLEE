"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value you place on the product, but my budget is limited. I would like to propose a price of $1000000 for the product.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that budget can be a constraint, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1000000. Considering the value I've placed on the product, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering it to you for $1250000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a price that reflects the product's worth while still being reasonable for you.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you're still looking to stay within your budget, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1100000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm now offering it to you for $1200000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. If you're still interested, this is your last chance to make a deal.",1200000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm surprised you're still willing to negotiate, Bob. I was expecting a final offer, but I appreciate your persistence. However, I've already made a significant concession by offering the product for $1200000 in the previous round. I'm not willing to go any lower. I'm willing to meet you at $1200000, but that's as low as I can go. If you're still interested, this is your last chance to make a deal.",1200000.0,Alice,7,

"I understand your position, Alice. However, after evaluating the product and considering my budget, I must respectfully decline the current offer of $1200000. I am unable to meet you at that price point. I will now consider purchasing the product from John for $800000.",800000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm surprised to hear that you're considering buying the product from John for $800000. I think you're underestimating the value of this product. I'm willing to give you one last chance to make a deal, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair price. I'm now offering the product to you for $1200000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. This is a final offer, and I expect you to make a decision now.",1200000.0,Alice,9,
