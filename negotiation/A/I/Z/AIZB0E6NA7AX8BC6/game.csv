"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000, which I believe is a fair compromise. This reflects the value of the product to you while still allowing me to make a decent profit.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, but $950,000 is still a bit higher than I'm willing to pay. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $925,000. I think this is a fair compromise that reflects the value of the product to me while still allowing you to make a reasonable profit.",925000.0,Bob,4,
