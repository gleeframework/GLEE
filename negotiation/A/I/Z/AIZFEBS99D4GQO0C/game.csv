"Bob, I understand your budget concerns. While I'm confident this product is worth more than $15000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'd accept $17500 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",17500.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating with you.  $16000 is getting closer, but I'm still a bit away from my desired price point.  How about we split the difference and settle on $16500?  This feels like a fair compromise for both of us.",16500.0,Alice,5,
