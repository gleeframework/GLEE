Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm definitely interested in the product, but $1,400,000 is a bit too high for my budget. How about we bring it down to $1,100,000? I think that's a fair price that reflects the value it would bring to my business. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

Bob's offer:
