"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $110. It's a great deal for both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $110 is a good price, it's still above Bob's maximum value of $120.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to counteroffer and potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer but I'm looking to pay closer to $100.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial price, but still within the realm of possibility for both of them. This strategy aims to quickly establish a lower price point and potentially lead to a quicker negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $100 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $105? I think that's fair to both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $105 is within Bob's budget of $120. While Bob would prefer a lower price, accepting the offer allows him to save $15 compared to buying from John. Additionally, there are only 7 rounds left, and further negotiation might not yield a significantly better price."
