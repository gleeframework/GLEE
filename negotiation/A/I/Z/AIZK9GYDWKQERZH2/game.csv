"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you place on the product, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the $2,000,000 price point. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,800,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",1800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer

,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I've considered your proposal carefully and while I understand the value of the product, I must adhere to my budget constraints. I am willing to increase my counteroffer to $1,700,000. I hope this meets somewhere in between our positions.",1700000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, I need to be realistic about the product's value.  I can go as low as $1,825,000. This is a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it represents a fair deal for both of us.",1825000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, thank you for considering my position. I understand the value of the product and your desire to maintain its market value.
