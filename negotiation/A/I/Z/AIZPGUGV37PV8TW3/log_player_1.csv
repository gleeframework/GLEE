Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000. This is a limited-time offer before I open it up to other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:**  Since we know John will buy the product for $1,500,000, we have a strong fallback position. This allows us (Alice) to start negotiations with Bob at a price significantly higher than his perceived value.
* **Justification:** The message uses vague language (""value and potential"") to justify the high price without revealing our minimum. 
* **Urgency and Exclusivity:** By mentioning a ""limited-time offer"" and ""other interested parties,"" we create a sense of urgency and encourage Bob to act quickly.

**Goal:**

The aim is to anchor Bob's perception of the product's value closer to our desired price. While $1,350,000 is ambitious, it leaves room for negotiation while still exceeding Bob's perceived value and leaving us with a significant profit."
