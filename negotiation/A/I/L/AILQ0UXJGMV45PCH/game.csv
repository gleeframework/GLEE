"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. Would you be willing to meet me halfway?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000 to show you I'm serious about making this deal work. This is my final offer, let me know your decision.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down to $9,000, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $8,750? I'm really interested in the product and would like to make a deal with you.",8750.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $8,750 just doesn't work for me. I'm willing to go down to $8,900.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's close this deal, I'm confident you'll be happy with this purchase.",8900.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I understand your concerns, but $8,900 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, would you be willing to go down to $8,800? I'm really interested in the product and I think we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",8800.0,Bob,6,
