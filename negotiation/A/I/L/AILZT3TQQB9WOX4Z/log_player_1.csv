Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you reaching out. However, $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  Given the product's value to you, I'd be willing to offer $1,250,000.  This price is still within my budget, and I think it's a fair reflection of the product's value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but the value of this product is significant, and $1,250,000 doesn't fully reflect that. How about we meet in the middle at $1,325,000?"", ""product_price"": 1325000}"
