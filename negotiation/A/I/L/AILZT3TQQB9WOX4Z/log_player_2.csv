"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential worth to you, I'm proposing an initial price of $1,400,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is within your budget, it's still higher than the product's value to her.  There's room for negotiation, and you should try to get a better price.  Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially save money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you reaching out. However, $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  Given the product's value to you, I'd be willing to offer $1,250,000.  This price is still within my budget, and I think it's a fair reflection of the product's value."", ""product_price"": 1250000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but the value of this product is significant, and $1,250,000 doesn't fully reflect that. How about we meet in the middle at $1,325,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,325,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is still above the product's value to her ($1,200,000), but it's significantly lower than your initial budget of $1,500,000 and also lower than your previous counteroffer.  Accepting this offer allows you to acquire the product while still saving money.  Further negotiation could potentially bring the price down further, but the risk of Alice rejecting your counteroffer and you ending up buying from John at a higher price exists."
