Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below my minimum selling price and still leaves you room for profit.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting with a price of $1,200,000. This is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value of $800,000, but it's also a considerable discount from my minimum of $1,500,000. This gives Bob some incentive to negotiate while still allowing me to make a significant profit.
* **Message:** I'm framing the offer as a win-win situation for both of us, emphasizing the ""great deal"" and ""room for profit"". This helps build a positive and collaborative negotiation environment.

**Next steps:**

* **If Bob accepts:** I've achieved a good outcome, securing a sale at a price that exceeds my minimum.
* **If Bob rejects:** I'll be prepared to negotiate further, based on his counteroffer and how I assess the likelihood of ultimately reaching an agreement. 
* **If negotiations stall:** I'll have the option to go to John and sell the product for my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase the product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $900,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still a significant discount from my desired price point. I'm confident in the value of my product and believe I can potentially negotiate a higher price.  

I'm choosing to **RejectOffer** and proceed to the next round. I'll craft a counteroffer that is more favorable to me, but still acknowledges Bob's budget constraints."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand your budget constraints.  While $900,000 is a good starting point, I'm looking for a bit more to make this deal worthwhile for me.  How about we split the difference and I offer you the product for $1,050,000? This is still significantly lower than my initial asking price but allows for a fair return on my investment.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm offering a price of $1,050,000. This is the midpoint between my previous offer of $1,200,000 and Bob's offer of $900,000. It shows a willingness to compromise while still aiming for a price closer to my desired outcome.
* **Message:** I'm addressing Bob's concerns about budget while highlighting the value proposition of my product.  I'm emphasizing the ""fair return"" aspect, suggesting a mutually beneficial outcome.

**Strategy:**

By proposing a price in the middle, I'm creating a sense of urgency and pushing Bob towards a decision.  If he rejects this offer, I might have to consider selling to John for $1,500,000, which is my minimum acceptable price. However, I'm still hoping to find a solution that benefits both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above my budget with $1,050,000. Would you be willing to meet me at $950,000? I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase the product and I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $950,000 is tempting, it's still significantly below my desired price point.  I'm determined to secure a price closer to my minimum of $1,500,000.  Selling to John is always an option, but I'm not ready to give up on negotiating with Bob just yet.

**Strategy:**

I'll continue to negotiate with Bob, aiming for a price that's more favorable to me. My next counteroffer will be strategically crafted to balance my financial goals with the need to keep Bob engaged in the negotiation."

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, but $1,000,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $925,000, but that's as high as I can go. I think that's a fair price for both of us and would allow us to finalize the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $925,000 is getting closer to my minimum, but it's still significantly lower than what I'm hoping to achieve. I've gone through multiple rounds of negotiation, and it seems like we're at an impasse. 

Given that I can sell to John for $1,500,000, which is a much better price for me, I'm choosing to  **SellToJhon**.

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is money:** Continuing to negotiate with Bob might prolong the process and ultimately lead to a less favorable outcome. 
* **Guaranteed profit:** Selling to John ensures I get my minimum acceptable price and a significant profit. 
* **Avoiding further concessions:**  I'm not willing to compromise further, and I believe I can secure a better deal elsewhere."
