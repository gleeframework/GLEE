"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below my minimum selling price and still leaves you room for profit.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand your budget constraints.  While $900,000 is a good starting point, I'm looking for a bit more to make this deal worthwhile for me.  How about we split the difference and I offer you the product for $1,050,000? This is still significantly lower than my initial asking price but allows for a fair return on my investment.  Let me know your thoughts.

Alice's offer:
