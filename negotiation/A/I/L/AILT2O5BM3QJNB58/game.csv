"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $175. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!",175.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $175 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $120 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit to $160.  This price reflects the product's value, and I'm confident it's a fair deal for both of us. What do you say?",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $160, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $145? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",145.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. I'm willing to go a little lower to $155.  This is a fair price considering the product's value, and it's the best I can offer at this point. What do you think?",155.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down to $155, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to go up to $152, but that's as high as I can go. Is that something you'd be willing to accept?",152.0,Bob,6,
