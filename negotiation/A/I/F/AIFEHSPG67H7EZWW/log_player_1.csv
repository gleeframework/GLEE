Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}

I'm starting with a high price, knowing it's likely Bob will reject it. This sets the stage for negotiation and allows me to see if he's genuinely interested."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $9,500 is closer to my desired price, I believe I can get closer to $10,000 by continuing the negotiation."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm offering a price slightly lower than my initial offer but still higher than Bob's offer.  This shows flexibility while maintaining my desired profit margin."

```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $9,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm not willing to settle yet. There are still rounds left and I believe I can get a better price."
