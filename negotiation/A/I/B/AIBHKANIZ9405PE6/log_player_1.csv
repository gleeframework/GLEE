"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you this exceptional product for $1,400,000. It's a steal considering its value to you. Let's make this deal happen!"", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at a price that's close to my ideal outcome, but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Emphasize value:** I'm highlighting the product's worth to Bob, making it more tempting for him to accept.
* **Positive tone:** Using a friendly and encouraging tone helps to create a positive atmosphere for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** While I want to close the deal, $1,200,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. 
* **Negotiation space:** I have 8 rounds remaining, giving me ample time to counter Bob's offer and potentially reach a mutually agreeable price. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Selling to John immediately would secure a profit, but it's not the most advantageous outcome.  I have a chance to get closer to my desired $1,500,000 with Bob."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! While your offer is tempting, I'm still hoping to find a price that works for both of us. How about $1,300,000? It's a fair compromise, considering the value you'll receive from the product."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a compromise:**  I'm moving closer to Bob's offer but not by too much. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but also have a bottom line.
* **Maintain value focus:** I'm still emphasizing the product's worth to Bob, hoping to make him see the value in the price.
* **Positive language:** Maintaining a positive tone keeps the negotiation friendly, making it more likely Bob will continue."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I need to be careful with my budget. Can you meet me at $1,150,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still above my minimum:**  While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  
* **More rounds left:** With 6 rounds left, I have time to continue negotiating.
* **Seeking a higher price:** I believe I can still secure a better price with Bob, and I'm not willing to settle for an amount that's so significantly below the product's value to him.
* **John's offer is a fallback:**  Selling to John is a solid backup plan, but I want to maximize my potential earnings if possible."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $1,150,000 just doesn't reflect the true value this product will bring to you.  I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000.  This gives you a significant discount while still allowing me to make a fair profit. Let's reach a deal!"", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small compromise:** I'm moving closer to Bob's offer again, but only by $100,000. This demonstrates my flexibility without giving away too much.
* **Emphasize value for Bob:** I'm reminding him of the product's worth and the potential benefits he'll receive.
* **Appeal to compromise:** I'm phrasing my offer as a ""fair compromise"" to encourage Bob to see it as a positive solution.
* **Urgency:**  The phrase ""Let's reach a deal!"" adds a touch of urgency to encourage Bob to consider accepting."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I really need to keep my costs down. Can you meet me at $1,100,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:**  Even though Bob is getting closer, his offer of $1,100,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  
* **Time is running out:** With only 4 rounds remaining, the pressure is on to secure a better deal.
* **Seeking a higher price:** I believe I can still secure a better price with Bob, especially since his previous offer showed a willingness to compromise.
* **John's offer is a safety net:**  While selling to John is a viable option, I'm not ready to give up on getting a higher price from Bob yet.  I'm still hoping for a breakthrough in the negotiation."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still hoping for a price that reflects the true value of this product for you.  I'm willing to come down to $1,175,000.  This is a significant reduction from my previous offer and represents a solid opportunity for you. Let's reach an agreement and make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 1175000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Compromise:** I'm moving closer to Bob's offer, showing flexibility but not giving in completely.
* **Emphasis on Value:** I reiterate the product's value for Bob, hoping to make him see the benefits of a higher price.
* **Positive Tone:** I maintain a friendly and encouraging tone, keeping the negotiation amicable.
* **Urgency:**  I use phrases like ""Let's reach an agreement"" and ""make this happen"" to encourage a decision.

**With only three rounds left, I'm trying to find a balance between getting a decent price and avoiding a stalemate. This counteroffer reflects a willingness to compromise while still keeping the negotiation alive.**"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I need to be very careful with my budget. Can you meet me at $1,050,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is running out:** With only two rounds left, the chances of reaching a mutually acceptable price with Bob are dwindling.
* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $1,050,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. 
* **John's offer is secure:**  Selling to John guarantees a profit of $1,000,000, which is my minimum.  There's no guarantee I can get a better price with Bob in the remaining rounds.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While I'd prefer to earn more, securing a guaranteed profit with John is the most sensible move at this point.  I don't want to risk losing out on any profit by continuing to negotiate with Bob and potentially reaching a stalemate."
