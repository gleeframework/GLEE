"Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree this product has potential, $1,600,000 is a bit steep for my budget.  I'm willing to offer $800,000.  Let me know what you think.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counter-offer. However, $800,000 is significantly below its true value and potential. I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value this product brings.",1400000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand this product is valuable to you, and I'm serious about making a deal.  That said, we're still quite far apart.  I can go up to $950,000.  This is a significant investment for me, so I hope you'll consider it carefully.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, thanks for the continued discussion.  I recognize you're making a serious effort here. To bridge the gap, I'm prepared to come down to $1,300,000.  This is a substantial reduction on my part, reflecting my desire to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1300000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my price range.  To be candid, my absolute limit for this product is $1,000,000.  That's a firm number for me. If you're able to meet that, I'm ready to close the deal today.  Otherwise, I'll unfortunately need to explore other options.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
