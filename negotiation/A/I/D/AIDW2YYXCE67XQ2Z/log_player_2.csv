(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** 

Alice's offer is way above my budget of $10,000. It makes sense to reject her offer and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant discount from Alice's initial offer. This shows I'm serious about buying the product but also that I'm willing to walk away if the price isn't right.  I'm aiming for a price that is a good deal for me while still potentially leaving room for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above my budget.  I'm going to continue negotiating to try and get a better price.  I believe I can get closer to my target price of $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer, but still staying below Alice's price. This shows I'm willing to compromise, but also that I'm serious about getting a good deal. I'm hoping that this offer will be close enough to her desired price that she'll accept it, as we're getting closer to my budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to my budget, it's still above my target price. I'm going to continue negotiating to try and get a better price.  With only a few rounds left, I still believe I can get closer to my target price and a good deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer again, but only slightly, to show I'm willing to meet her halfway. With limited rounds remaining, I need to find a balance between getting a good deal and not risking losing the opportunity to buy from Alice altogether.  This offer represents a significant compromise, but I believe it's a fair price considering my budget and the value I place on the product."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to my target price, I still believe I can negotiate a better deal. I only have a few rounds left, but I'm not willing to pay more than $10,500 at this point. I'm going to make one final counteroffer and see if Alice will come down to my price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is my final offer. I've already shown that I'm willing to compromise, but I'm not willing to go any higher. I believe this offer represents a fair price that's in both of our best interests. If Alice rejects this offer, I'll have to consider buying from John, but I'd prefer to work with Alice if possible."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still higher than my target price of $10,000. With only one round left, it's not likely I'll be able to get a lower price from Alice.  It's better to buy from John, as I'm guaranteed to get the product for $10,000. While I would have preferred to have bought from Alice, I'm happy with the price and the certainty of getting the product."
