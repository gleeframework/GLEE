"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product.  Given its unique nature and potential, I'm starting the bidding at $2,200,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for an item of this caliber.",2200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $2,200,000 is far beyond my budget.  Given my understanding of the product's value, I'm willing to offer $850,000. This is a serious offer, and I believe it represents a fair price for both of us.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, your offer is significantly below the product's true market value.  I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This reflects the product's potential and ensures a fair deal for both of us.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $1,900,000 is still a stretch for me.  Let's find common ground. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,100,000. This demonstrates my serious interest in the product, and I believe it's a fair price for both parties.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm seeing some progress, but we're still quite far apart.  I'm willing to lower my price to $1,700,000.  This is a significant reduction on my part, reflecting my desire to make a deal. Let's get this done.",1700000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer, but $1,700,000 is still out of my range.  I'm prepared to offer a final price of $1,250,000. If you're not willing to accept this offer, I'll have to consider purchasing the product from another seller.",1250000.0,Bob,6,
