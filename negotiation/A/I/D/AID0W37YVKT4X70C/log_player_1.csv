Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $2,200,000 is far beyond my budget.  Given my understanding of the product's value, I'm willing to offer $850,000. This is a serious offer, and I believe it represents a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $1,900,000 is still a stretch for me.  Let's find common ground. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,100,000. This demonstrates my serious interest in the product, and I believe it's a fair price for both parties. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer, but $1,700,000 is still out of my range.  I'm prepared to offer a final price of $1,250,000. If you're not willing to accept this offer, I'll have to consider purchasing the product from another seller. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

While we could push Bob further, his ""final offer"" language suggests he might be losing patience. Accepting $1,250,000 is a significant profit above Bob's initial offer and avoids the risk of him walking away entirely."
