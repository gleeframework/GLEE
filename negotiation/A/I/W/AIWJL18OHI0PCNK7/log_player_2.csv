"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

You can get the product for $80 from John, so there's no reason to accept Alice's offer of $100.  It's better to try and negotiate a lower price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 75} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $75. This is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer of $100, but still leaves some room for negotiation. I'm hoping Alice will be willing to come down a bit to close the deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her offer, it's still above my target price of $80. I can still get the product from John for that amount, so I'm going to reject Alice's offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 80} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm going to counter with $80. This is my maximum price, and I'm hoping Alice will accept it.  I'm confident that if she rejects this offer, I can simply buy the product from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $85 is only $5 less than John's price.  I'm not confident I can get a better deal with Alice, so I'll buy the product from John to guarantee the price I want."
