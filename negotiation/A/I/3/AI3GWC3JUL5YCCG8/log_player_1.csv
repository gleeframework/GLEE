Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,000,000 from John, so you won't accept anything less.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,200,000, meaning there's a potential $200,000 surplus you could negotiate for.
* **One Shot:** You only get one chance with Bob. If he rejects your offer, you go with John's guaranteed offer.

**Strategy**

You need to balance maximizing your profit with ensuring Bob accepts the offer. Offering a price too close to $1,200,000 risks rejection, while going too low leaves money on the table.

**Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exclusive opportunity to purchase [product name]. Given its unique value proposition, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Strong Opening:** The message highlights the product's value and exclusivity.
* **Strategic Price:** $1,150,000 gives Bob a significant discount ($50,000) while securing you a $150,000 profit above your guarantee.
* **Urgency:**  Mentioning ""other interested parties"" (even if John is your only alternative) creates a sense of urgency for Bob to act quickly.

**Important Note:**  Negotiation is fluid. Bob might counter-offer. Be prepared to adjust your price slightly, but don't go below your $1,000,000 baseline."
