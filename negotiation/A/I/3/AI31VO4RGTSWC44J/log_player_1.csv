It's time to accept Bob's offer. Here's why:

* **Diminishing Returns:**  We're past the halfway point in the negotiation, and Bob's increases are getting smaller.  Continuing to push risks losing him altogether.
* **Opportunity Cost:** While we might get a slightly better price by continuing, each round carries the risk of Bob walking away. Accepting now secures a significant profit.
* **Strong Offer:** $1,070,000 is a healthy profit margin above our minimum. Holding out for an extra few thousand might not be worth the risk at this stage."
