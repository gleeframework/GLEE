Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

This offer is higher than Bob's estimated value, but it still leaves some room for negotiation,  allowing me to potentially earn closer to my desired $1,500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

While Bob's offer is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum. I'm willing to risk another round of negotiation to see if I can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm reducing my price slightly from the initial offer, but still above Bob's last offer. This shows a willingness to compromise, but maintains my target price within reach."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Bob's offer is getting closer, but I'm starting to worry that we'll get stuck in a loop of counteroffers. I'm comfortable with the guaranteed $1,500,000 from John."
