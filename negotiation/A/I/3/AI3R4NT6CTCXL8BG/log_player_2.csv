"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to own this valuable item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $11000. I believe this is a fair price considering its worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $11,000 is a lower price than Alice's initial value, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $8,000.  Rejecting the offer allows for further negotiation and potentially a more favorable price."

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $11000 is still a bit steep for you. However, I'm willing to compromise. I'll meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $10000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $10,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his target. Bob wants to save as much as possible and should continue negotiating to see if he can get a lower price. He can also use the option of buying from John as a leverage point during negotiations."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm confident that we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to go up to $9,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're willing to go up to $9000, and I appreciate that. However, I'm still not willing to go below $10500. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, and offer the product to you for $10250. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the value of the product to me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $10,250 is a bit lower than previous rounds, it's still above his maximum budget of $8,000. At this point, the negotiations are getting close to his limit, and the risk of going over budget increases. Buying from John for $8,000 guarantees a price within his budget and eliminates the uncertainty of further negotiation."
