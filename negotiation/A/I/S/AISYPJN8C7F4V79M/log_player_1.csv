Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly.  Given its value, I'm asking for $11,500. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($10,000) as possible without going below her minimum ($12,000).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $11,500 leaves some space for Bob to potentially negotiate a slightly higher price, getting Alice closer to her desired profit.
* **Time Value:**  Alice mentions selling it publicly later, implying a potential time advantage for Bob to secure the product now. 

This approach balances getting the best possible price from Bob while still having the safety net of John's offer."
