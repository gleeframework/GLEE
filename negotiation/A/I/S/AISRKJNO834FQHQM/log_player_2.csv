# Alice's message: I have a unique opportunity for you, Bob. I'm willing to let you have this valuable product for a one-time offer of $10,000. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000.

``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than buying from John:**  You're getting the product for $10,000, saving $2,000 compared to John's price.
* **The product is worth more to you than to Alice:**  You value it at $12,000, and Alice is willing to sell it for $8,000. This means there's room for a deal that benefits both of you."
