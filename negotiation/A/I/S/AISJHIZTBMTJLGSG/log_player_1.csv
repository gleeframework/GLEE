{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000.  It's a fair price, considering the value it holds for you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a point that's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price but leaves room for negotiation. It also gives Bob a reason to consider the offer seriously, highlighting the value he'll receive."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your willingness to sell the product. However, I am only able to pay $850000 for it. I hope this aligns better with the value you place on it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $800,000.  However, it's closer to my desired outcome than selling to John, so I'll counteroffer and try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This reflects the product's value and allows for some room for negotiation. Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. I would like to propose a price of $875000 for the product. I believe this offers a fair compromise between the value you place on it and my budget. I look forward to your response. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $875,000 is still below my desired price, but it's above my minimum acceptable price of $800,000 and also above what I would get from selling to John.  Therefore, I'll accept Bob's offer and sell the product to him."
