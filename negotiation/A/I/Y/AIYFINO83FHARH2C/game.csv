,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $100 is a bit too high for my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $80. Can you meet me at that price?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $80 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit though. How about $95? That's still a great deal for you.",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $95 is still a bit too high for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $85. Can you meet me at that price?",85.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, and I'm willing to be flexible. However, $85 is still a bit too low for me. Let's split the difference - $90. I think that's a fair price for both of us.",90.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $90 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $87.50? That's the lowest I can go.",87.5,Bob,6,
