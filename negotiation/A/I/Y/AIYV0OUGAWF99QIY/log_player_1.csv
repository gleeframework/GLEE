"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product. I'm asking for $100 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting high, at $100, as I want to maximize my potential earnings.  I'm also being friendly and open to negotiation by saying ""Let me know what you think!"" This shows I'm willing to work with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $100 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider a lower price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $80 is my minimum, I'm not going to give in immediately. I want to see if I can push for a better price. I'll reject Bob's offer and see if he's willing to come up a bit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $80 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $90. If you're really interested, let's see if we can meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 90}
```

I'm offering $90, which is halfway between my initial offer and Bob's offer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate and hopefully encourages Bob to counter with a price closer to my desired range. I'm also reiterating my willingness to work with him to find a solution."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $90 is still a bit high for me. Would you be willing to meet me at $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

At this point, Bob's offer is getting close to my minimum and I don't want to risk him walking away completely. Accepting his offer at $85 is a good compromise and ensures I get a decent price for the product."
