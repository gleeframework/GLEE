"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we discuss the price, I want to start with a fair and competitive offer of $1,200,000. This is a great opportunity to get a deal on a product that's truly worth $1,500,000 to you. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that the product is worth more than $900,000. After reconsidering, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a great compromise that still gives you a good deal, but also reflects the product's true value. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  To be totally transparent, my budget for this is closer to $1,000,000.  If you're able to meet that, I'm ready to close the deal.",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $1,000,000 is your absolute maximum, and I appreciate your honesty. After careful consideration, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll meet you at $1,050,000, which is still a great deal for both of us. This is my final offer, so I hope you'll consider it.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
