Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm asking for $100 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($80) to leave room for negotiation.
* **Friendly Tone:** I'm using a friendly message to build rapport and encourage Bob to consider the offer.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm leaving the door open for Bob to counteroffer, allowing for a potential win-win scenario."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was hoping to keep my spending within $80. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Room for Profit:** While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, there's still room for me to make a bit more. I can try to get closer to my desired price. 
* **Testing the Waters:** Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to gauge his willingness to go higher. It also allows me to signal that I'm not desperate to sell."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $95? I believe this is a fair price considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Negotiation:**  I'm acknowledging Bob's offer but proposing a price closer to my desired range.
* **Compromise:**  Offering to ""split the difference"" demonstrates a willingness to compromise while still aiming for a higher price.
* **Emphasize Value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to reinforce the justification for a higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I understand your position and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a price of $92 for the product. This would allow us to stay closer to the middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Desired Price:** Bob's offer of $92 is very close to my desired price range and significantly higher than my minimum of $80. 
* **Minimizing Risk:**  At this point, further negotiation could risk losing Bob altogether, as he might become frustrated and walk away.  
* **Time Efficiency:** Accepting the offer allows me to close the deal quickly and avoid further rounds of negotiation.

By accepting Bob's offer, I secure a good price for the product while minimizing the risk of losing the sale."
