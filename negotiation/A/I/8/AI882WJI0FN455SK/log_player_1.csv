"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that I think you'd be interested in. I'm asking for $100 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price of $100. This is a good starting point because it's above my minimum of $80, but still leaves room for negotiation. I'm also adding a friendly message to build rapport with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested, but $100 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $85. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $85 is close to my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price. I'm going to counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is a little low for me. I'm willing to come down to $95. This is a fair price considering the value you'll get out of this product. Let's make a deal!"", ""product_price"": 95}
``` 
 
I'm offering $95, which is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer. I'm also emphasizing the value of the product to encourage him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're trying to get a good price, but $95 is still a bit high for me. How about we split the difference and I pay you $90? I'm really interested in this product, let's see if we can make this work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer of $90.  This is a good price, considering my minimum is $80, and it's likely I won't be able to get a better price from Bob.  It's also better than selling to John for $80."
