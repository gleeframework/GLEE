"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product and I think you'd really love it. I'm asking for $120 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than my minimum but still leaves room for negotiation. I'm also being friendly and encouraging Bob to engage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $120 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is below my minimum threshold of $80. While I'm tempted by the quick sale, I believe I can get a better price. I'll reject his offer and try to push for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I appreciate you're interested!  $85 is a little too low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit.  How about $95? It's a great deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 95}
``` 
 
I'm trying to find a middle ground with Bob. $95 is still significantly higher than my minimum but acknowledges his willingness to negotiate.  I'm optimistic that we can reach an agreement in the next few rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand, Alice. I'm trying to stick to a tight budget. Could we meet in the middle at $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $90 is still lower than my ideal, but it's above my minimum threshold and a good compromise.  It's important to close the deal before the 10 rounds are up, and I think this is a reasonable price for both of us."
