"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this great product for a steal! It's a fantastic deal that I think you won't want to pass up.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Alice's offer is quite close to your maximum but there's still room for negotiation to get a better deal.  You should counter-offer."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can do a bit better than that, Bob! I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think the product is worth a bit more than that. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $92.

Alice is stubbornly staying above your desired price point. It's time to push back a bit harder or consider John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice, but $92 is still a bit too high for my budget. I could do $82, and I think that's a fair price."",

``` 

We are narrowing the gap, but standing firm below Alice's minimum might encourage her to settle."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to get a good deal, Bob, but I think $82 is a bit too low. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit. How about we meet at $88? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $88. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $88
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice is very slowly coming down, and you're running out of room to negotiate.  $88 is a decent price, and continuing to haggle might make Alice pull out or refuse to budge further.  It's better to secure the deal now."
