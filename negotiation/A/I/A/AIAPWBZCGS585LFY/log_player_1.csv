Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  I believe it holds significant value for someone like you, and I'm confident it can greatly benefit your operations. I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000.  This is a unique opportunity to acquire a valuable asset."", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Anchor:** Starting with a price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($800,000) sets a strong anchor. While this number is below my minimum, it leaves room for negotiation and makes Bob feel like he might be getting a deal if he can haggle me down.
* **Justification:**  Vaguely mentioning the product's benefits to Bob's operations adds a touch of personalization without revealing specific details that could weaken my position.
* **Urgency:**  Highlighting ""unique opportunity"" subtly introduces a sense of scarcity, potentially encouraging Bob to act quickly. 

This strategy aims to:

1. **Maximize profit:** If Bob accepts the initial price or negotiates down to a price above $1,500,000.
2. **Provide a cushion:**  Even if Bob negotiates, there's a good chance of settling above the $1,500,000 I have guaranteed with John.
3. **Maintain John as backup:** If Bob rejects the offer, I can proceed with selling to John at my desired minimum price."
