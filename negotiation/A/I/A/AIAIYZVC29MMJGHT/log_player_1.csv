Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it's worth $10,000 to you, and I'm willing to let it go for $9,000. This is a great deal for something of this value."", 
""product_price"": 9000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always better to start high in a negotiation. This leaves room for bargaining and makes Bob feel like he's getting a deal if he can get you to come down.
* **Value Emphasis:** Highlighting the product's worth to Bob  ($10,000) aims to make the asking price seem more reasonable.
* **Backup Plan:** You have a guaranteed sale at $8,000 with John, so there's no risk in aiming higher with Bob. 

**Important Note:**  This is just one strategy.  Depending on your risk tolerance and how much you want a quick sale, you could adjust the price closer to $8,000."
