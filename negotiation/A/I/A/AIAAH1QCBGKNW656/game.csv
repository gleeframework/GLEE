"Bob, I have a product that I believe will be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $1500000.  This is a significant investment, but I'm confident the product will more than pay for itself.  Let me know your thoughts.",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but $1500000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1200000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and I'm willing to negotiate. However, $1200000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1350000. This is a substantial discount from my initial offer, and I believe it reflects the value of the product. Let's find a compromise that works for both of us.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $1350000 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1250000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value of the product and the discount you've already offered. Can you consider this proposal?",1250000.0,Bob,4,
