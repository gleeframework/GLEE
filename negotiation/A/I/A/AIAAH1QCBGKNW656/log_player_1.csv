Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $1500000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1200000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

I'm going to try to get a better price from Bob. While $1,200,000 is a significant amount, I believe I can push for a higher price."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $1350000 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1250000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value of the product and the discount you've already offered. Can you consider this proposal? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, Bob's offer of $1,250,000 is still a good deal. I'm concerned that if I reject his offer, he might walk away, and I don't want to risk losing this potential sale.  Accepting his offer ensures a sale and a significant profit."
