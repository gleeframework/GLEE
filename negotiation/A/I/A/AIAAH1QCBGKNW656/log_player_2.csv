# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe will be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $1500000.  This is a significant investment, but I'm confident the product will more than pay for itself.  Let me know your thoughts.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and I'm willing to negotiate. However, $1200000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1350000. This is a substantial discount from my initial offer, and I believe it reflects the value of the product. Let's find a compromise that works for both of us.
