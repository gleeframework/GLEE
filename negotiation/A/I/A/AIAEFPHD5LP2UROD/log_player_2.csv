"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I believe a starting price of $1,400,000 is fair. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is too high.  While it's within my budget, I want to try and negotiate a better price.  I have 10 rounds to work with, so I'm not in a rush to accept immediately."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you reaching out. While I'm interested in the product, $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'd be willing to offer $1,250,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but the product holds significant value and  $1,250,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $1,325,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,325,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,325,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I have more rounds to negotiate, so I'll try to get the price down further.  There's still a good amount of room for us to meet in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. While I value the product, $1,325,000 is still outside my ideal price range. Let's split the difference: I'm willing to pay $1,300,000. This would be a fair compromise and allows us to both get a good deal."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
