"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I believe a starting price of $1,400,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",1400000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you reaching out. While I'm interested in the product, $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'd be willing to offer $1,250,000.  What do you think?",1250000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but the product holds significant value and  $1,250,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $1,325,000?",1325000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. While I value the product, $1,325,000 is still outside my ideal price range. Let's split the difference: I'm willing to pay $1,300,000. This would be a fair compromise and allows us to both get a good deal.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
