"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'll love.  I'm asking for $175 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly above what I know the product is worth to me.  This leaves room for negotiation while still ensuring I make a profit.  I'm also being friendly and positive to encourage Bob to consider my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $175 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $100 for it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is way too low. It's below my minimum value of $150, and I'm not willing to sell it for that price. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $100 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to go down to $137.50. That's still a great price for this product."", ""product_price"": 137.50} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $137.50 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $115, which is a fair price for both of us. Let's close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $115 is better than Bob's previous offer, it's still below my minimum value. I'm going to counter again, hoping to get a price closer to my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to come up on your offer. However, $115 is still below my minimum. I'm willing to go down to $125, which is a fair compromise for both of us. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 125}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $125 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you at $120.  This is a good deal for both of us, and I'm ready to close it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While $120 is still below my ideal price, it's getting closer to my minimum.  With only a few rounds left, I'm not willing to risk losing the deal with Bob and having to sell to John for less.  $120 is a decent profit, and I'd rather close the deal with Bob."
