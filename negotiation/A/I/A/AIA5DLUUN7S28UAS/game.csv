"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'll love.  I'm asking for $175 for it. What do you think?",175.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $175 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $100 for it. What do you think?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $100 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to go down to $137.50. That's still a great price for this product.",137.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $137.50 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $115, which is a fair price for both of us. Let's close this deal.",115.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to come up on your offer. However, $115 is still below my minimum. I'm willing to go down to $125, which is a fair compromise for both of us. Let's close this deal.",125.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, $125 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you at $120.  This is a good deal for both of us, and I'm ready to close it.",120.0,Bob,6,
