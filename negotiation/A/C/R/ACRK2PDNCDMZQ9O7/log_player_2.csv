"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'd like to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product for $18,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

Alice's offer is much higher than both your budget and what John is offering. It makes the most sense to buy from John for the best price."
