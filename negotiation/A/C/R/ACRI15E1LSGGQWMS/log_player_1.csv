Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $11,999. It's a fantastic deal on a product I know you'll find valuable."", 
""product_price"": 11999
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $12,000, you want to see if Bob will pay even slightly more. 
* **High but Appealing:** $11,999 is a high price, but it's just under your guaranteed sale price. This creates the perception of a ""deal"" for Bob while maximizing your potential earnings.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** While unlikely in this scenario, there's a tiny chance Bob might counter-offer, giving you a chance to still get a price higher than $12,000."
