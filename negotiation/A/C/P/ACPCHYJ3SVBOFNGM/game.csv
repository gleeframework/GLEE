"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $2,000,000 is far beyond my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product, which is a fair price considering my valuation and your desired outcome. I'm confident this deal will benefit both of us.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective on the valuation.  However,  $2,000,000 is closer to its true worth. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,750,000. This offer reflects the product's value while acknowledging your interest.",1750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1,750,000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,250,000, which is a significant increase from my initial offer. This price reflects the value of the product while still allowing for a fair profit for you. I'm confident this is a good deal for both of us.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
