"I'm really interested in the product, but $175 is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $120 for it. Can you meet me in the middle?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. $120 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $145? That's a fair price for both of us.",145.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $145 is still a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $110 for the product. I'm really interested in making a deal, but I need to stay within my budget.",110.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $110 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little more, but I need to get at least $135 for this. Let's make this deal happen!",135.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but $135 is still a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $115 for the product. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle and make a deal.",115.0,Bob,6,
