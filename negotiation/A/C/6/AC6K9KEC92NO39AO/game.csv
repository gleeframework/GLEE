"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $1,400,000 is a bit steep for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more to you than $1,100,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our original prices, so I'm offering it to you for $1,300,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you, and I think you'll find it a great investment. What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, you're right, this product would be a great asset.  However, I need to stick to a tight budget.  Would you be willing to consider $1,150,000?",1150000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $1,150,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm offering it to you for $1,250,000. This is the best I can do, and I think it's still a great deal considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",1250000.0,Alice,5,
