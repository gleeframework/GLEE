"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic product that I believe would be incredibly valuable to you.  To kick things off, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,150,000.  This is a unique opportunity to acquire something truly special."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:**  Starting high allows room for negotiation while aiming for a price closer to Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000).
* **Justification:**  Vaguely mentioning the product's value to Bob piques his interest without revealing its full worth to you.
* **Positive Framing:** Using terms like ""fantastic"" and ""unique opportunity"" enhances the product's desirability."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product you're offering. I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $1,050,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is above our minimum, we have room to negotiate. It's still early in the process, and we started high strategically. Rejecting this offer signals that we believe the product is worth more, encouraging him to potentially move closer to his perceived value in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I believe the value of this product is significantly higher.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,125,000.  This is a fair offer considering the unique benefits it offers you."",
""product_price"": 1125000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Smaller Concession:**  We're making a smaller concession this round ($25,000) to show we're serious about a higher price.
* **Reiteration of Value:**  We're reminding Bob of the product's value to him, subtly anchoring it in his mind.
* **""Fair Offer"" Framing:** By presenting our counteroffer as ""fair,"" we aim to make Bob more receptive to accepting a higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,075,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is slowly increasing his offers, indicating he's willing to pay more than his initial counteroffer. We're still above our minimum and have time to negotiate.  The goal is to encourage him to reach at least $1,100,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence.  Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to accept $1,100,000 for the product. This is my final offer."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise and Finality:**  We're splitting the difference between our last offer and his, signaling a willingness to compromise while establishing this as our final offer.
* **Direct Language:** Using clear language (""final offer"") emphasizes the seriousness of accepting this price. 
* **Time Constraint:**  As we're getting closer to the halfway point, creating a sense of urgency can push Bob toward a decision."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. Thank you for your flexibility. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,080,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,080,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Diminishing Returns:** Bob's counteroffers are increasing in smaller increments. It's unlikely he'll significantly jump from here.
* **Profitable Outcome:** $1,080,000 is a substantial profit above our minimum, making it a good deal overall.
* **Time Value:**  Dragging the negotiation further risks losing the opportunity cost of selling to John. Accepting now secures a solid profit."
