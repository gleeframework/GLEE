"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing product, and I think we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,100,000. Is this something you'd like to consider? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high.  It's in my best interest to try to negotiate a lower price. I'm not willing to pay more than $800,000, so I'll reject her offer and see if we can come to a better agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested in the product,  $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to offer $850,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I place on the product. Let's see if we can reach a deal."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your offer, Bob, but I'm afraid $850,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $950,000. This is a fair price considering the value I place on the product, and I believe it's a good compromise between our initial offers. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to my target price, it's still too high.  I'm going to reject her offer and see if I can push for a lower price.  I'm comfortable going to John as a last resort, but I'd prefer to try and get a better deal with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. While I'm getting closer to your price, $950,000 is still a bit too steep for me. I'm willing to go up to $900,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise that reflects the value we both place on the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to go down to $900,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'm counteroffering at $975,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $975,000 is still above my maximum budget of $800,000.  With only a few rounds left, it's not likely we'll be able to reach a mutually agreeable price.  It's time to cut my losses and go with John's offer."
