"I'm excited to offer you this amazing product, and I think we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,100,000. Is this something you'd like to consider?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested in the product,  $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to offer $850,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I place on the product. Let's see if we can reach a deal.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, Bob, but I'm afraid $850,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $950,000. This is a fair price considering the value I place on the product, and I believe it's a good compromise between our initial offers.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. While I'm getting closer to your price, $950,000 is still a bit too steep for me. I'm willing to go up to $900,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise that reflects the value we both place on the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to go down to $900,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'm counteroffering at $975,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price for the product.",975000.0,Alice,5,
