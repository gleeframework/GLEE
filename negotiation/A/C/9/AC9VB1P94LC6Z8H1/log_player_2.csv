"Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

You can get the product for a lower price from Alice, so it makes sense to try to negotiate further.  $120 is still too high for you, so rejecting the offer allows you to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Explanation:**

You're aiming to save as much money as possible.  Offering $100 is a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer, but still leaves some room for negotiation. It's a fair starting point for your counteroffer, and hopefully Alice will accept it."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice is coming back with a higher price than your counteroffer. While you could accept and save a bit compared to John, you're still not at the price you want.  There's room for further negotiation, so rejecting the offer allows you to try and get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

**Explanation:**

You're trying to find a middle ground.  Alice's counteroffer was $125, and you offered $100. This counteroffer of $110 is a compromise that might be appealing to both of you.  It's still a good deal for you, but you're also showing willingness to meet Alice halfway."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice is not budging much.  You've already made several counteroffers and Alice keeps coming back with prices that are still too high. You're close to your $150 limit and  buying from John will ensure you get the product while minimizing the risk of further negotiation."
