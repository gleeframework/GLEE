Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $14,000. I believe it will be highly beneficial to you."", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

Here's why this strategy makes sense:

* **Maximize Profit:**  We're aiming to get as close as possible to Bob's $15,000 valuation. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** While $14,000 is a strong starting point, it leaves some space for Bob to potentially negotiate, increasing your chances of closing the deal.
* **Secure a Significant Gain:** Even if Bob negotiates down slightly, selling at this price point still earns you a substantial profit compared to your backup offer from John ($12,000)."
