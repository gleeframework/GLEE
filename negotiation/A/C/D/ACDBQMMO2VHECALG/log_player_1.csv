Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your product sounds intriguing, but $1,500,000 is out of my budget. Given its value to you, I'm confident we can find a price that benefits us both. I'd be willing to pay $1,200,000 for it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.
