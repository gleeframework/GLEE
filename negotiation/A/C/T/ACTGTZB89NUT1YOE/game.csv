"Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product! I'm excited to discuss the price with you. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer you the product for $12,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $10,000. I believe this price is a fair compromise that benefits both of us. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you be willing to come down to $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $8,000 is a significant discount, but I'm not willing to go that low. After reconsidering, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $10,500. This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's value to you is $10,000. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. How about we settle on $9,500?  That's a fair price that acknowledges the product's value while working for my budget.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $9,500 is a tempting offer, Bob, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for that price. I'm willing to make another concession and offer the product for $10,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair deal considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,5,
