"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with an offer of $15,000 for the product.",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, $15,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for it. Let's see if we can work something out.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $10,500 is a bit lower than my target, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $13,500. Let's see if we can find a sweet spot.",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $13,500 is still a bit outside my budget. How about we split the difference and settle on $12,000?  It's a fair compromise and allows us both to come away happy.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I like the idea of finding a fair compromise, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $12,000 just yet. I'm willing to come down a bit more. I'm now offering the product to you for $13,000. Let's see if we can get closer to a deal.",13000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I think we're getting closer.  $13,000 is still a bit high for me.  Let's try $12,500.  This is a fair price that is within my budget and still gives you a good profit.",12500.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to meet me in the middle. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving too much on the table. I'm now offering the product to you for $13,250. Let's see if we can find a sweet spot.",13250.0,Alice,7,
