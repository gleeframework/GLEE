"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1200000. Considering the product's value to you is $1500000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer you the product for $1350000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value to you. What do you think?",1350000.0,Alice,3,
