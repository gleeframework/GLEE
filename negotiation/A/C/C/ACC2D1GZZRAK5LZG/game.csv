"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $12,000 is too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $6,000 for the product.  What do you think?",6000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm thinking of a price of $9,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and quality.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you coming down, Alice, but $9,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about $7,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see you're serious about getting a good deal, Bob. I'm willing to come down a bit further. How about $8,500? This is as low as I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great value for the product.",8500.0,Alice,5,
