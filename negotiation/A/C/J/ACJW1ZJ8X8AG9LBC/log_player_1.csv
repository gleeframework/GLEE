{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this fantastic product for $18,000. It's truly a unique opportunity, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 18000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high price of $18,000. This gives me some room to negotiate down if needed. I'm also emphasizing the value of the product to create interest and make Bob want to buy it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product, but my budget is limited. I am willing to pay up to $15000 for it. Could we meet somewhere in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $15,000 is closer to my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price. I'll counteroffer in the next round to see if we can find a more agreeable middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $15,000 is still a bit lower than what I need.  How about we meet at $16,500? That seems like a fair compromise, and it allows both of us to get a good deal. "", ""product_price"": 16500}
```

I'm offering $16,500 as a compromise. This is still above my minimum, but it shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate. I'm hoping Bob will see this as a fair price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your response, Alice. Considering my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price of $14500 for the product. This is my final offer, as I am keen to secure this purchase within our current negotiation. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum price. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I'm not going to settle for less than $12,000. I'll counteroffer in the next round to see if we can find a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $14,500 is simply not enough for me.  I'm willing to come down to $15,500, which is a significant compromise on my end. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping you'll see it as a fair deal."", ""product_price"": 15500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I've carefully considered your proposal, and I would like to counter with an offer of $14750 for the product. This is my final offer, and I hope it meets your needs. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum price of $12,000. We're running out of rounds, and I don't want to risk losing the opportunity with John. It's better to sell to John for $12,000 than continue negotiating with Bob and potentially end up with nothing."
