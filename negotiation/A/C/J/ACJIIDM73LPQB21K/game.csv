"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,000,000. This is a great deal, considering its true value to you is $800,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I agree the product is impressive, the price point is a little high for me. I'd be willing to purchase it for $650,000.  I believe this represents a fair offer considering its value to me.",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $650,000 is a significant amount to you, but I'm still looking to get a better return on my investment. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $850,000. This is a compromise that I believe is fair, considering the product's value to you and my initial asking price. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. However, $850,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go. Would you consider $725,000? I think that's a fair compromise and would allow us both to walk away happy.",725000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $725,000 is still a bit lower than my target price, but I'm willing to consider it. I'm going to make a counteroffer to you. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $800,000. This is the highest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a good compromise considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",800000.0,Alice,5,
