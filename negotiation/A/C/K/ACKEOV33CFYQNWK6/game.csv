"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice, but I'm not comfortable with the initial offer of $1,100,000. I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value the product would bring to my business. I'm open to negotiations and willing to meet in the middle if necessary. What do you think?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $900,000 doesn't quite meet my needs.  Let's find a middle ground.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.  This still allows me to cover my costs while giving you a significant advantage.  What do you say?",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price of $1,050,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and make a counteroffer of $950,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value the product would bring to my business. What do you think?",950000.0,Bob,4,
