Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,800,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the market value of similar products. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,800,000 is significantly below what I believe the product is worth. This product offers unique advantages and potential that similar products on the market simply can't match. How about we meet in the middle, at $2,100,000? I believe that's a fair compromise."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers, so I'm proposing a counteroffer of $2,050,000. I think this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value and the market conditions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $2,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $2,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** We are still significantly above John's offer, and Bob is clearly engaged in negotiation. While moving closer to his price point, we don't want to concede too much too quickly.  There's room to negotiate further and potentially secure a better deal than John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I see you're serious about this product, and I respect that. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $2,000,000.  This is a very competitive price for a product of this caliber."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you at $1,900,000, which is a significant discount from your initial offer. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value of similar products. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:** While we were aiming higher, Bob's offer of $1,900,000 is still significantly more than John's $1,500,000. Continuing to push for a higher price risks alienating Bob and potentially losing the deal altogether. It's a strong offer and a good business decision to accept."
