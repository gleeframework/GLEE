"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I think you'll find it's a game-changer in your industry. I'm willing to start with a price of $1200000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is a good starting point, but there's definitely room for negotiation.  Since Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible, rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer is the best strategy at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'd be willing to pay $1,000,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer represents a significant drop from Alice's initial price, showing Bob is serious about negotiating.  $1,000,000 is still a good price for Bob, given his maximum budget, and it leaves room for potential concessions from Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1000000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $1100000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to Bob's desired price.  $1,100,000 is a good deal for Bob, as it's well below his maximum budget and a significant saving compared to buying from John.  While further negotiation could potentially yield a lower price, there's a risk of losing the deal altogether.  Accepting this offer secures the product at a favorable price."
