"I have a great product that I think you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $140. It's a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with the price.",140.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for offering the product. I appreciate it, but I was hoping to find something within my budget of $120. Would it be possible for us to negotiate down to $120?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're on a tight budget, but I'm not sure I can go as low as $120. I can do $130, which is the lowest I'm willing to go. It's still a great deal for you, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, but I'm still hoping to stay within my budget. Could we possibly meet somewhere in the middle? Perhaps at $135?",135.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm not quite ready to go up to $135. I can do $137.50, and that's as high as I'm willing to go. It's a fair price, and I think you'll be happy with it.",137.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I see where you're coming from, but I'm still aiming to keep the price closer to my budget. Would $136 work for you?",136.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to my minimum price, but I'm still not willing to go quite that low. I can do $138, and that's as low as I'm willing to go. It's a fair price, and I think you'll be happy with it.",138.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still trying to stay within my budget. Could we possibly meet at $137?",137.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go any lower than $139. I've already compromised a lot, and I think that's as low as I can go. If you're not willing to meet me at that price, I'm going to have to consider other options.",139.0,Alice,9,

"I'm not willing to go any lower than $140. I've already given you a significant discount, and I need to make a profit. If you're not willing to meet me at that price, I'm going to have to sell the product to someone else.",140.0,Alice,11,
