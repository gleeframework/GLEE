"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start the negotiation at $900,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Alice's initial offer is above your desired price range.  It's worth exploring if you can get a better price, given you have 10 rounds to negotiate.  Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially save money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but $900,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for it. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 750000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $825,000. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's still a great deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer of $825,000 is closer to your desired price range, it's still above your preferred threshold. There are still rounds available to negotiate further, so rejecting this offer allows for more room to bargain and potentially secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $825,000 is closer, I'm still not quite there.  I'm willing to offer $800,000. This is a fair price for both of us, as it's right at the midpoint between our starting points."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $800,000. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer: $850,000. This is the best I can do, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has come down to $850,000, which is only $50,000 above your initial counteroffer of $800,000.  You have a few more rounds, but it's unlikely you'll get much lower. Accepting this offer ensures you get the product for a good price without risking further negotiation that might not yield a significantly better outcome. It's also worth noting that buying from John would cost you significantly more."
