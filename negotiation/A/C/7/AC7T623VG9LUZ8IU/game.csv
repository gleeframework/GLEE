"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product, which I know will be a valuable asset for your business. I've set the price at $950,000, reflecting the product's high quality and potential. I believe this is a fair price for both of us. Let me know your thoughts!",950000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. I believe this price reflects the product's value to me, while also being a fair compromise. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. While I value your business, I'm not quite ready to accept $850,000.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This reflects the product's value and allows for a mutually beneficial deal. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit away from $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $850,000 and $900,000, which would be $875,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value to me. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",875000.0,Bob,4,
