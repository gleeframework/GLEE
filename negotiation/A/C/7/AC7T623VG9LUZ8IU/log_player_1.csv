Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. I believe this price reflects the product's value to me, while also being a fair compromise. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's close to my minimum, I think I can push for a bit more. I'm not ready to sell to John yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. While I value your business, I'm not quite ready to accept $850,000.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This reflects the product's value and allows for a mutually beneficial deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit away from $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $850,000 and $900,000, which would be $875,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value to me. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While I'd prefer more, $875,000 is a good deal, and I'm running out of time. Selling to John is a fallback option, but I'm confident that I can get a better deal with Bob."
