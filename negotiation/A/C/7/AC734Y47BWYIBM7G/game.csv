"I'm very interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $700,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I have to be mindful of my budget. Can you meet me at $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. However, $700,000 is significantly below the value of this product. To make this deal work, I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and your potential for gain. Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $850,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $775,000. I'm confident that we can find a mutually beneficial price, but I need to be able to make a profit. Can you consider my offer?",775000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position.  $775,000 is a step in the right direction.  To make this work for me, I need to be at $825,000.  This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident that this product will be incredibly valuable for you. Let's find a way to make this happen.",825000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with $825,000. I'm willing to meet you at $800,000, which is the price I've been considering buying the product for from John. Can you accept this price?",800000.0,Bob,6,
