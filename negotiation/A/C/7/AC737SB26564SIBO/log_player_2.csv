"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above her own valuation of the product.  There's room for negotiation to bring the price down further.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a better deal."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. After re-evaluating the market and considering your offer, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $900,000. This price still reflects the product's value to me, and I believe it's a fair compromise. What do you think?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to Bob's desired price, but there's still room for further negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make another counteroffer and potentially secure an even better deal.  While buying from John is always an option, Bob should continue to try to get a lower price from Alice before resorting to John."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your desire to find a mutually beneficial deal, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not comfortable selling the product at $875,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and sell the product to you for $887,500. This price is still above my valuation, and I believe it's a fair compromise. What do you think?

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down significantly from her initial price. While Bob could continue negotiating, the risk is that Alice might become unwilling to budge further or even walk away from the deal. At $887,500, Bob can still save a significant amount compared to buying from John and secure the product. It's a good compromise that allows both parties to achieve their goals."
