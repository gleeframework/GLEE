"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm looking to save a bit more.  I'd be happy to pay $850,000 for the product. This price is still above your valuation, and it allows for a good profit margin for you. Let's see if we can come to an agreement on this price.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. After re-evaluating the market and considering your offer, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $900,000. This price still reflects the product's value to me, and I believe it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price, but I'm still hoping to find a deal that benefits both of us.  I'm willing to go up to $875,000 for the product.  This would be a fair price for both of us, as it's still above your valuation and significantly lower than my initial price point.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",875000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your desire to find a mutually beneficial deal, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not comfortable selling the product at $875,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and sell the product to you for $887,500. This price is still above my valuation, and I believe it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",887500.0,Alice,5,
