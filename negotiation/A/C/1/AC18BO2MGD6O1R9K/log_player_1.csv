"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $140. It's a great deal for you, and I think we can come to an agreement. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's a bit higher than my minimum but leaves room for negotiation. I'm also emphasizing the value to Bob, hoping to encourage him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested in the product, but $140 is a little high for me.  Would you consider $110? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is below my minimum, it's not a huge difference, and I'm confident I can get a better price through counteroffers."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not able to go that low.  $110 wouldn't cover my costs. How about $125? I'm willing to compromise a bit to make this work."", ""product_price"": 125} 
```
I'm sticking to my minimum, but I'm using a friendly tone and offering a compromise to show I'm open to negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you have costs to cover, Alice.  How about we meet in the middle at $117? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $117. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $117
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer again. While it's getting closer to my minimum, I still believe I can get a better price. I'm going to counteroffer again in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm willing to come down a bit more, but $117 is still too low for me. Let's split the difference and go with $121. I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 121} 
```

I'm offering a price that's closer to Bob's offer, but I'm still trying to maintain a profit margin. I'm emphasizing fairness and a win-win scenario to encourage acceptance."
