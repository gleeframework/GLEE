"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $900000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'd be willing to pay $700000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not quite there. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $750000? This would be a fair price for me and would leave room for us to close the deal.",750000.0,Bob,4,
