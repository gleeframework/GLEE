Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $900,000 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum value of $1,000,000. I'm hoping to get closer to my desired price in the next few rounds."

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,100,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $950,000. I think this is a reasonable price considering the product's value to me.

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While he's getting closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a bit more. I have a few rounds left, so I'm going to keep trying to negotiate."

Round 6
Bob's offer:

I'm going to sell the product to John. We've only got 4 rounds left, and Bob's offers are not getting high enough for me to accept. While I'm disappointed that I can't get more than $1,000,000, it's still a good deal for me and guarantees I reach my minimum value."
