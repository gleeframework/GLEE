"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $12000. This is a great opportunity to get your hands on this valuable item, and I think you'll find it's worth every penny. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $12,000 is significantly higher than his maximum budget of $8,000. It makes sense to try to negotiate a lower price with Alice before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer but $12,000 is higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. It's a fair price considering my budget and the value I place on it.  Let me know if you're interested in negotiating further."", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $8500. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer it to you for $10500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to me. Let me know if you're interested in moving forward. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $10,500 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still higher than his ideal price point. There's still room for negotiation, so rejecting and making a counteroffer is the best move."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $10,500.  I'm still  working with a tight budget.  I can go up to $9,500. This is the absolute maximum I can afford.  Let me know if you're willing to work with me at this price."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I appreciate your willingness to go up to $9500. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll offer it to you for $10000, which is the minimum price I'm willing to accept. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

At this point, Alice is firm on $10,000. While Bob could try another counteroffer, the chances of Alice accepting are slim.  It's best to cut his losses and buy the product from John for $8,000, saving $2,000 compared to accepting Alice's final offer."
