# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. After considering our market analysis and your potential interest, I'd like to make you an offer of $1,100,000 for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

You can likely get a better price than $1,100,000. Rejecting the offer allows you to try and negotiate a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm still looking to get a better price for the product. After reconsidering, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,050,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value and market demand. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000

While $1,050,000 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, John is still offering a better deal at $1,000,000.  It's better to save the extra $50,000 and go with John."
