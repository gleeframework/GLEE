"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product for sale. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to own something truly unique. As we discuss the price, I'd like to start with an offer of $600,000. I believe this is a fair and competitive price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly lower than the product's value to you.  It's in your best interest to try and negotiate a better price. There's potential for savings here, so rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer is the best strategy."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you starting the conversation. However,  $600,000 is quite a bit lower than I'd be willing to pay for this product. I'm happy to continue the discussion, but I'm only able to offer $700,000 right now. Let's see if we can find a compromise."", ""product_price"": 700000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $700,000 is your maximum, but I'm still hoping to get closer to the product's true value. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $725,000. This is a compromise that I think is fair, considering the product's worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $725,000.
