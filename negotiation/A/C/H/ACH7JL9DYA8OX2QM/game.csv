,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your offer. However, $8,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to compromise a bit further, but I need to be closer to my asking price. Would you consider $9,000? This would still be a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit away from the price I'm comfortable with. I'd be willing to meet you halfway between $8,500 and $9,000, so how about $8,750? Would you be willing to sell it to me at that price?",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best possible price, and I appreciate your continued interest. However, $8,750 is still below my minimum for this product.  Would you be willing to meet me at $9,250?  This is a fair price for both of us, allowing me to make a profit while still giving you a good deal.",9250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm afraid I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make one final offer: $8,750 is still too high for me. How about $8,500, but I'll throw in a small favor for you - I'll give you a good review on a platform that a lot of your customers use. Would you be willing to meet me at $8,500?",8500.0,Bob,6,
