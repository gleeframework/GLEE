"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $18,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Given the value to me, I'm willing to pay $14,000.  This would still be a profitable deal for you, and it's the highest I can go.",14000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your honesty and willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking of a price a bit higher than $14,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $16,000. This is still a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.",16000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $16,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $15,000, which is a fair price for both of us. It's a significant amount of money for me, and I hope you'll consider this final offer.",15000.0,Bob,4,
