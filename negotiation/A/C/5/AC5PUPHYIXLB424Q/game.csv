"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice, but I'm not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. I believe it's a fair price considering the value I'll get from it.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $900,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to make sure I'm still getting a fair price for the product.  How about $1,100,000? That's a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the value of the product to you.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, Alice, but $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,050,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I'll get from the product.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
