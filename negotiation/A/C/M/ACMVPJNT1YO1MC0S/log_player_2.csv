"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you a unique opportunity to acquire a valuable product. I believe its worth is significantly more than $800000, but I'm willing to let it go for $900000.  This is a one-time offer, and if you decline, I have another buyer lined up at $800000.  Consider the potential, and let me know your decision. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
