"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this exceptional product with you. It's a unique opportunity to acquire a valuable asset that I'm sure will bring you significant returns. I'm willing to start the conversation with an offer of $2000000. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000.

Bob should reject the offer. $1,500,000 is far above his budget, and he can likely get a better price by negotiating."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the value of this product,  $1,500,000 is unfortunately out of my price range.

```"

I'm counteroffering at $1200000. This is a fair price that I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's a good compromise. What are your thoughts?

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $1,200,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $900,000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer and demonstrates my commitment to closing this deal. I believe this price is fair considering my budget and the value of this product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer to $900000, but I'm still not convinced that's enough to justify the value of this product. I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $1100000. This is a compromise that I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value. What are your thoughts?

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $950,000. I'm getting close to my limit, but I'm still confident this is a fair price for both of us. Let's try to find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $950000 is still below my target. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my desired price. I'm counteroffering at $1050000. This is a compromise that I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should buy from John. Alice's offer is only $50,000 less than John's offer, and there's only 3 rounds left. It's not worth the risk of Alice rejecting his counteroffer and potentially losing out on the deal completely."
