Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $900000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to ensure I'm making a fair profit. I'm counteroffering at $925000. This is my final compromise, and I hope we can seal the deal in this round. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $925,000 is still above my ideal price, it's getting closer to my budget.  Considering Alice has made a concession and is calling this her final offer, I'm willing to accept. It's a better deal than purchasing from John, and the product's value may justify the slight overshoot of my initial target."
