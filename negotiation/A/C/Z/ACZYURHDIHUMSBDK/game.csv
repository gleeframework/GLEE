"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start with a price of $1100000. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1100000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to pay $850000 for this product. I believe this is a fair price considering the value it holds for both of us. Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $950000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you and my minimum price. Let's see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $950000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm prepared to pay $900000, which I believe is a fair compromise. This allows you to make a good profit while staying within my budget. Let's aim for a deal in this round.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $900000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to ensure I'm making a fair profit. I'm counteroffering at $925000. This is my final compromise, and I hope we can seal the deal in this round.",925000.0,Alice,5,
