{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The offer is way above your budget.  It's better to try and negotiate with Alice or go with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm starting with a low counteroffer to see where Alice is at.  This is significantly lower than her original price, but it's a starting point for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000

Alice's offer is still too high.  I'll try a counteroffer again."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}

I'm increasing my counteroffer to $1,200,000. This is still lower than Alice's current offer, but it shows I'm willing to negotiate and get closer to her asking price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice's offer is still a little high. I'll try one more counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

I'm getting closer to Alice's price, but still leaving some room for negotiation. This counteroffer is only $200,000 away from my maximum budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,520,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Alice's offer is close to my maximum budget, I'm going to try one last counteroffer to see if I can save a little more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1480000}
```

I'm offering $1,480,000.  This is a bit more than my previous offer, but still leaves $20,000 on the table and is closer to Alice's last offer.  It's a compromise, but I hope she'll accept it."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's offer is at my maximum budget, but I've already made a counteroffer that she rejected. There's no guarantee she'll accept another counteroffer in the last round. Since I can buy the product from John for the same price, it's safer to just go with John and avoid the risk of not getting the product at all."
