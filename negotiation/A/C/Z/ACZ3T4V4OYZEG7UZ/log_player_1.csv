"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,200,000. This is significantly less than what the product is worth to Bob, but it leaves room for negotiation and allows me to maximize my potential profit.  I want to see if Bob is willing to bite at a price that's still very beneficial to me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $1,100,000 is a good price, I'm still aiming for a higher profit. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer in the next round.  I have 8 rounds left, and I'm confident I can secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm raising the price slightly to $1,150,000. This is a compromise, showing Bob that I'm willing to negotiate but also that I'm not willing to go much lower. It's still a very good deal for Bob, and I believe there's a good chance he'll accept."

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While $1,050,000 is still a significant profit for me, I believe I can get closer to my desired price range. I have 6 rounds remaining, and I'm confident I can negotiate a better deal. I'm going to try and push Bob a bit further by making a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm going to meet Bob halfway at $1,100,000. This shows good faith and acknowledges that I'm willing to compromise. It's still a very good deal for me, as it's significantly above my minimum acceptable price. With only 5 rounds left, I need to start moving towards a resolution."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $1,050,000 is still significantly higher than what John is offering ($800,000). With only 4 rounds left, I'm taking a calculated risk. I don't want to push too hard and risk losing Bob completely, especially with the threat of John still hanging over me. This deal is good enough, and I'm going to secure it before I have to resort to John."
