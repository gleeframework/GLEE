"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750000. I believe it's a fair price considering the market value and my budget. Can you meet me in the middle?",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm afraid I can't meet you in the middle at $750000. However, I'm willing to compromise and offer you a price of $875000. This is the highest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a great value for the product.",875000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $875000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'd like to propose $812500. This is the maximum I'm willing to pay for the product. Can you consider this offer?",812500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your budget constraints, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll offer you a price of $850000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a great value for the product.",850000.0,Alice,5,
