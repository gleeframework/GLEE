Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I know this product is valuable to you, and I'm offering you the first chance to own it. I'm asking for $1,900,000.  I believe this price reflects its true worth and potential."", ""product_price"": 1900000}
``` 
 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium. 
* **Strong Opening:**  Starting with a significantly higher offer ($1,900,000) leaves room for negotiation if Bob counters. 
* **Justification:** The message subtly implies the product's value might be even higher than Bob's valuation, potentially making him more amenable to a higher price. 

**Important Notes:**

* This strategy assumes I have some time and flexibility to negotiate with Bob. If I need to sell quickly, a price closer to $1,500,000 would be more strategic.
* This is a single-round offer. A more complex negotiation with multiple rounds could lead to a different outcome."
