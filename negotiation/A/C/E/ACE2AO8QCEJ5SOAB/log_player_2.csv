"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm asking for $125 for it. Let me know if you're interested, as I have another buyer lined up. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $125 is less than your maximum budget, there's a chance Alice might lower the price to avoid losing the sale.  You're willing to buy from John for $150, so you have some room to negotiate."
