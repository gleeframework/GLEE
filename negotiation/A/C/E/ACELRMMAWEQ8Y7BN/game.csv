"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $900,000 is a good starting point, but I'm still a bit away from where I need to be.  I'm willing to come down to $925,000.  This is a fair price considering the value this product brings to you, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",925000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, Alice. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $900,000 and $925,000. I'll offer $912,500 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the value it brings to me.",912500.0,Bob,4,
