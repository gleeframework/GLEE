{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited about the potential of this product for you.  I'm offering it to you for $950,000.  This is a significant discount from its true value, and I believe it reflects a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting at $950,000, which is a good starting point. It's significantly higher than my minimum of $800,000, but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Message:** The message is friendly and emphasizes the value of the product for Bob while also framing the offer as a fair deal.  
* **Strategy:** This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing profit and keeping the negotiation open. By starting with a higher price, it leaves room for concessions while also highlighting the value of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my desired price, I'm not willing to settle just yet.  I believe there's still room for negotiation to get closer to my target of $950,000. Rejecting his offer allows me to make a counteroffer and try to close the gap further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $900,000 is a good starting point, but I'm still a bit away from where I need to be.  I'm willing to come down to $925,000.  This is a fair price considering the value this product brings to you, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit.  Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 925000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm counteroffering at $925,000, which is a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's. This shows flexibility while still keeping the price high. 
* **Message:** I'm acknowledging Bob's offer and highlighting the value of the product for him. I'm also framing the counteroffer as a fair compromise that allows both of us to achieve our goals.
* **Strategy:**  I'm aiming to meet in the middle while still pushing for a higher price. This strategy encourages further negotiation while demonstrating my willingness to compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, Alice. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $900,000 and $925,000. I'll offer $912,500 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the value it brings to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $912,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $912,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $912,500 is very close to my desired price of $925,000.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial goal, accepting this offer ensures a good profit ($112,500) and avoids the risk of further negotiation that might lead to a lower price or a deadlock.  It's also important to consider the potential time and energy costs of continuing the negotiation."
