This is a fantastic opportunity to secure such an exceptional product at a price that offers significant savings compared to its true worth of $15,000. I look forward to your consideration. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While it's better than John's price, Bob can likely get a better deal by negotiating.  He's willing to pay up to $15,000, so there's room for negotiation."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I appreciate your interest in our product. After careful consideration, I am willing to consider your offer of $10,000. However, given the product's quality and the value it brings, I propose a counteroffer of $11,000. This still represents a substantial saving compared to its true worth of $15,000. I hope this proposal is acceptable, and I look forward to your feedback.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob should accept Alice's offer. He's willing to pay up to $15,000, and Alice is now offering the product for $11,000. This represents a significant saving compared to his maximum price, and is a good deal for him.  Further negotiation might get a lower price, but there's a risk that Alice might reject the offer and he'd have to buy from John at a higher price."
