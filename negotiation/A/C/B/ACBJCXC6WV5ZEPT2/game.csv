"Alice, your offer is significantly higher than my budget. While I appreciate the opportunity, I'm only willing to pay $800000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my limits, and I hope you'll consider it.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $800000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $1200000. This is a very competitive price, and I'm confident you'll find it hard to find a better deal elsewhere.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1200000 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $900000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. I believe this is a fair compromise and hope we can come to an agreement.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to find a compromise, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for $900000. I'm willing to make another counteroffer, but I need to get closer to my original price. I'm offering the product to you for $1100000. This is a very competitive price, and I'm confident you'll find it hard to find a better deal elsewhere.",1100000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1100000 is still a bit too high for me. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to pay $1000000 for the product. This is a fair price for both of us, and I hope we can reach an agreement.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
