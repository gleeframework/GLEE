Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $90 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell it to you for $95. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
You should accept Alice's offer. While you can try to negotiate further, it's likely Alice won't go lower than $95.  This price is within your budget, and it's better than buying from John for $120."
