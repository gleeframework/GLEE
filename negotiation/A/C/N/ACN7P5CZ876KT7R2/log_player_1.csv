Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's worth more than that to me, and I know you'll find it very valuable. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$900,000:** This price is a compromise. It's higher than Bob's valuation, but still lower than my minimum acceptable price.
* **Message:** This message is friendly and emphasizes the value proposition for both of us. It also includes a call to action, asking Bob to respond.

**Why this strategy?**

* **Maximize profit:**  By offering a price close to my minimum, I increase the chance of Bob accepting, which is better than selling to John for $1,000,000.
* **Avoid risking a deal:** If Bob rejects, I have a guaranteed backup buyer in John, so I'm not taking a huge risk by lowering the price slightly."
