"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $1,050,000 for this product.  I believe that's a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in the product. What do you think?",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,050,000 is significantly below the market value of this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and agree on $1,100,000. This price reflects a fair compromise for both of us.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm prepared to go up to $1,075,000.  This price is closer to what I can afford, and I believe it reflects the value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1075000.0,Bob,4,
