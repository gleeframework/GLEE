"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think would be perfect for you! I'm offering it to you for $10,000.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value, but leaving room for negotiation.
* **Building Rapport:**  I'm emphasizing the product's value and using a friendly tone to build rapport. 
* **Leaving Room:**  I'm not starting at my minimum acceptable price ($12,000) to leave room for negotiation and avoid an immediate rejection."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer!  $10,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $8,500 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.
* **Room for negotiation:**  I have 8 rounds left, which gives me ample opportunity to counter and try to get a better price.
* **Potential for better deal:** While John is a reliable option, there's a chance I can get closer to my desired price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $9,250?  That seems like a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9250} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer:**  I'm countering Bob's offer, but I'm not going down to his price. Instead, I'm splitting the difference.
* **Fair Compromise:**  I'm presenting the counteroffer as a fair compromise that benefits both of us. 
* **Leaving Room:**  I'm not going all the way up to my desired price, but I'm leaving room for further negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice,  I understand your position.  $9,250 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $9,000.  I'm really interested in this product and I hope we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:**  While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.
* **Plenty of Rounds Left:**  I have 6 rounds remaining, so there's still time to negotiate and potentially get a better price.
* **Risk Assessment:** While selling to John for $12,000 is a safe option, I'm willing to risk a few more rounds with Bob to see if I can push him higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob,  I appreciate your willingness to move up.  However, $9,000 is still a bit low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,500?  This would be a fair price for both of us, and it would allow me to move forward with the sale."", ""product_price"": 9500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Staying Firm:** While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm not dropping my price drastically. This counteroffer is still above Bob's offer, but lower than my previous offer.
* **Focusing on Fair Compromise:**  I'm emphasizing the idea of finding a fair compromise that works for both parties.
* **Building Urgency:**  I'm subtly adding a sense of urgency by mentioning that this price would allow me to move forward with the sale."
