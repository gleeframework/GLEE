"I understand you're on a tight budget, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $12,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $14,000. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm glad we're getting closer, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $13,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $14,500. This is my final offer, but I think it's a great deal for both of us.",14500.0,Alice,5,
