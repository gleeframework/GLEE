# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, and I'm willing to be flexible.  However, $1,050,000 is a bit too far below my desired price point.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,150,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground there. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000.
