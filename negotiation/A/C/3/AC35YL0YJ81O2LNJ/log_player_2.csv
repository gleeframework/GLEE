"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $50. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $50
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

The product is worth $80 to me. Alice's offer is $50, which is a good price, but there is still room for negotiation.  I'll reject her offer to see if I can get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 40} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm aiming for a price significantly lower than my maximum value of $80, but still leaving room for potential compromise. $40 is a reasonable starting point for negotiation, and it demonstrates my interest in purchasing the product while also highlighting my willingness to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $55. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $55
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is only $5 higher than my previous counteroffer, which suggests she might be willing to come down a bit more. I'm not in a hurry and I can still try to get a lower price. I'll reject her offer and see if I can get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 45} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly from $40 to $45. This shows Alice I'm serious about buying the product, but I'm still pushing for a price that's more advantageous to me. It's a compromise that could lead to a successful deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $60
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting closer to my maximum value, but it's still not ideal.  I'm willing to keep negotiating, especially since I have a backup option with John.  Rejecting this offer allows me to see if Alice will make further concessions or if I should move on to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 50} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is now only $10 less than my maximum price. It's getting risky to continue rejecting offers, but I'm still hoping to save a little more. I'll counter with $50, which is a reasonable compromise and could potentially lead to a deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $65. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $65
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is now $15 more than my initial counteroffer of $50. We seem to be stuck in a stalemate, and it's not clear if she'll budge. With only 3 rounds left, it's becoming too risky to continue negotiating. While I would prefer a lower price, it's better to secure the product for $80 from John than risk getting nothing at all."
