"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'd like to offer you a great deal on this product, but I have to be honest with you, I've already received another offer from another buyer who is willing to pay the full value of the product, which is $1,500,000. However, I'm willing to give you a chance to purchase it from me at a price of $1,200,000. This is a very competitive price, and I think you'll find it's a great value. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Alice's story about another buyer is likely a negotiating tactic. Even if it's true, you have a better alternative with John."
