"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $10,000 is simply too low for me to consider.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $11,500. This allows us both to make a reasonable deal.  Let me know your thoughts.",11500.0,Alice,3,
