"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $13,000 is a good price, Bob can likely do better. There's room for negotiation, and Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to counter and potentially secure a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $10,000 is simply too low for me to consider.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $11,500. This allows us both to make a reasonable deal.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $11,500 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, Bob can still do better. He's willing to pay up to $15,000, and there's still some room to negotiate with Alice. By rejecting, Bob can try to get closer to his target price of $10,000."
