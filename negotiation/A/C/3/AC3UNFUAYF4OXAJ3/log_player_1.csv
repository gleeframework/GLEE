Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000.  It's a great deal for both of us, as it's a significant value for you and allows me to get a fair price.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

This offer allows for some negotiation space while still remaining significantly above the product's value to Bob.  It's a good starting point, but I'm prepared to adjust my offer based on Bob's response and the potential to get a better price from John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you're providing. However, I am only able to pay up to $850,000 for the product at this time. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $850,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm still confident I can get closer to my ideal price. I'll counteroffer and see if I can push the price higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I value your business, I'm still not quite there.  How about $875,000? This would be a fair compromise for both of us, and I believe it's still a great value for you."", ""product_price"": 875000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. I'm willing to consider an offer closer to $860,000 if it's feasible for you. I believe this brings us closer to a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $860,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $860,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While $860,000 is not my ideal price, it's very close to my minimum and significantly higher than what I would have received if I sold to John immediately. It's important to consider that further negotiation with Bob might not lead to a higher price and could risk losing the sale altogether."
