Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and quality. What do you think?,9000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm really interested in the product, but $9000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $7500. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your budget constraints, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $8250. This is a one-time compromise, and I'm not willing to go any lower. What do you think?",8250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $8250 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $7000 for the product. I think that's a fair price considering the original price you mentioned was $9000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $7000. I'm willing to make one more compromise. I can offer you the product for $8000, which is the minimum price I'm willing to accept. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options. What do you think?",8000.0,Alice,5,
