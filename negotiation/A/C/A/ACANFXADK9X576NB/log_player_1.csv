Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $20,000. I believe it offers significant value, even beyond the asking price."", ""product_price"": 20000} 

**Reasoning:** 

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations higher than your desired price to allow room for bargaining.  
* **Gauging Interest:**  Bob's reaction to this initial high price will give you valuable insight into his level of interest and potential for negotiation.
* **Alternative Option:**  You have the security of John's offer ($15,000) if negotiations with Bob don't go well."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I'm willing to make a deal, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above Bob's Value:** Bob's offer of $12,000 is still $2,000 above his perceived value of the product. This indicates room for negotiation.
* **Below Your Minimum:** Accepting $12,000 would be a $3,000 loss compared to John's offer. 
* **Strategic Counter-Offer:** Rejecting Bob's offer allows you to present a counter-offer closer to your desired price while still encouraging him to continue the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand your budget constraints, Bob, but $20,000 is my initial offer.  I'm willing to come down to $17,000, but that's my best price.  This product is truly worth it."", 
""product_price"": 17000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant but Justified Reduction:** This counter-offer shows flexibility while still emphasizing the product's value.
* **Setting a Firm Limit:** Stating your ""best price"" establishes a boundary and potentially encourages Bob to reveal his true willingness to pay.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While closer to your minimum, there's a slight buffer should Bob counter again.  You can always fall back to John's $15,000 offer if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still a bit far from $17,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $14,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acceptable Profit:** $14,000 is only $1,000 less than John's offer and still a reasonable profit above your minimum.
* **Meeting Halfway:** Bob's willingness to ""meet halfway"" suggests he's serious about purchasing and may not go much higher.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Continuing to negotiate risks losing Bob altogether. Accepting now secures a solid profit and avoids a potentially lengthy negotiation process."
