"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am excited to present you with our premium product, which I believe would greatly benefit you. Given its value and quality, I am offering it to you at an exclusive price of $10,000. This is a special opportunity to acquire a product worth $8,000 to you at a competitive rate, while also allowing me to maximize my earnings. I look forward to your consideration. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $10,000 is higher than your maximum budget of $8,000. You have a guaranteed option to buy the product from John for $8,000. Therefore, it makes more sense to reject Alice's offer and buy from John to save $2,000."
