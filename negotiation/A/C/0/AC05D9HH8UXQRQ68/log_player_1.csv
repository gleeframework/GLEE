I'm starting with an offer of $1,500,000. This gives Bob room to negotiate while still leaving me a comfortable profit margin.  It's a good starting point to gauge his interest and see if he's serious about making a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Bob's offer is way too low.  I'm not willing to sell for that price. I'll make a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm lowering my price to $1,250,000. This is still a good profit for me and hopefully shows Bob that I'm willing to negotiate but also that his initial offer was far too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is still too low. I've already lowered my price significantly, and he's not budging much.  I'd rather sell to John and get a guaranteed $1,200,000 than risk further haggling with Bob."
