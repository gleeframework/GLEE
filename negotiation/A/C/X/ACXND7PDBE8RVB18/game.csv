"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. I believe it's worth every penny of its $80 value to you. To ensure we both benefit from this transaction, I propose a price of $75 for the product. This is a fair deal considering the value it brings to you. Let me know if you're interested, and we can proceed with the purchase.",75.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate the discount. However, $75 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $70 for the product.  Let me know if you're open to that price.",70.0,Bob,2,
