{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for your business, and I'm willing to part with it for $1,350,000. This is a limited-time offer before I open it up to other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** While we know John will buy the product for $1,500,000, securing a deal with Bob first is ideal. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $1,350,000 leaves room for negotiation while still exceeding Bob's perceived value of $1,000,000.  This price point makes it highly appealing to Bob, increasing the likelihood of a successful sale.
* **Sense of Urgency:** By mentioning other interested parties (even though John is our guaranteed buyer), we create a sense of urgency, encouraging Bob to act quickly. 

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing profit and ensuring a successful sale with Bob."
