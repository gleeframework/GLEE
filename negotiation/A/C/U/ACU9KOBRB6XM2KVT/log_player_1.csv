Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic opportunity to purchase a unique product that I believe would be highly valuable to you. Knowing how much you could benefit from it, I'm offering it to you for $12,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its potential value to you."", 
""product_price"": 12000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:**  Bob values the product at $15,000. 
* **Your Minimum:** You're willing to sell for a minimum of $8,000.
* **Maximizing Profit:**  Offering the product at $12,000 allows you to capture a significant portion of the value Bob sees in the product while still exceeding your minimum price. 

This strategy aims to:

1. **Secure a Deal:** The price is attractive to Bob, making it likely he'll accept.
2. **Maximize Profit:** You're getting $4,000 more than your minimum acceptable price.
3. **Avoid John:**  You avoid selling to John, who would only pay your minimum."
