"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As a starting point, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm looking to make a profit, so I hope you'll consider this offer seriously. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is above your maximum budget. While it's tempting to take the deal, there's potential for a better price. There are still 9 rounds left, and you can always buy from John for a guaranteed $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  My initial offer is $950,000.  I believe this is a fair price considering the value to me and the opportunity for you to make a solid profit.  I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still looking to make a significant profit. Considering the value you place on the product, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering it to you for $1,050,000. This is a compromise that I believe is fair, considering the value you'll get from the product and the potential profit I'll make. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to your desired price, it's still above your maximum budget. You still have several rounds to negotiate. It's worth rejecting and counteroffering again to potentially get an even lower price. You can always buy from John for $1,000,000 if the negotiation doesn't go your way."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,050,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000. This is my final offer, as it aligns with my budget. I believe it's a fair price considering the value you'll receive, and I'm confident this deal will benefit both of us."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your final offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still looking to make a decent profit. Considering the value you place on the product, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm offering it to you for $1,025,000. This is as close to your budget as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $1,025,000, but this is still more than you are willing to pay. You have 5 rounds left, but given the trend of the negotiation, Alice may be unwilling to go any lower. It's more advantageous to buy from John at this point, as it guarantees the product at your maximum budget."
