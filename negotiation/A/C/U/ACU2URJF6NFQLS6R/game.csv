"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  My initial offer is $950,000.  I believe this is a fair price considering the value to me and the opportunity for you to make a solid profit.  I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still looking to make a significant profit. Considering the value you place on the product, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering it to you for $1,050,000. This is a compromise that I believe is fair, considering the value you'll get from the product and the potential profit I'll make.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,050,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000. This is my final offer, as it aligns with my budget. I believe it's a fair price considering the value you'll receive, and I'm confident this deal will benefit both of us.",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your final offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still looking to make a decent profit. Considering the value you place on the product, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm offering it to you for $1,025,000. This is as close to your budget as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
