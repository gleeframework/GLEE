"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $175 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $155? I'm willing to pay that much for the product.",155.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and willingness to negotiate.  While $155 is closer, I'm still hoping for a slightly higher price to make this worthwhile for me. Would you be willing to pay $165?  Let's find a price that works for both of us.",165.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand your concerns, but $165 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $160. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider this offer?",160.0,Bob,4,
