Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
```

I'm starting with a high price of $2,000,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value, but it leaves room for negotiation if Bob is interested.  I'll see how he responds and adjust my strategy from there."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, I'm not willing to sell for that price yet. I believe there's still room for negotiation. I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a more favorable deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1900000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,900,000. This is a compromise, showing I'm willing to negotiate, but still leaves a profit margin for me. Hopefully, Bob sees the value in my product and is willing to meet me in the middle."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum value. While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, accepting his offer ensures a sale and avoids further negotiation. Selling to John would leave me with less profit, making this the better option at this point."
