"Bob, I believe this product has the potential to be incredibly valuable for your company. Based on my assessment, I'm offering it to you for $1,200,000. This price reflects the significant value it brings and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement.  I'm confident we can come to a deal that works for both of us.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. This offer is still fair given the value you mentioned, and it allows us to reach a deal that works for both of us.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position. While $900,000 is a good starting point, it doesn't quite reflect the full potential of this product for your company.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000 to find a compromise. This offer still allows for a significant return on investment for you, while also recognizing the value I bring to the table. Let's keep this conversation going and see if we can find a mutually agreeable solution.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further.  $1,000,000 is still a bit high for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway.  I'll offer $950,000 for the product.  This price reflects the value we both see in this deal, and it allows us to close the gap.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",950000.0,Bob,4,
