"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I believe this product has the potential to be incredibly valuable for your company. Based on my assessment, I'm offering it to you for $1,200,000. This price reflects the significant value it brings and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement.  I'm confident we can come to a deal that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.** You are willing to pay up to $1,500,000, but Alice is asking for $1,200,000. 
* **There's room for negotiation.**  You can likely get a better price by making a counteroffer.
* **Buying from John is a backup.**  You can always go to John if negotiations with Alice fail, but you should try to save money by negotiating with Alice first."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position. While $900,000 is a good starting point, it doesn't quite reflect the full potential of this product for your company.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000 to find a compromise. This offer still allows for a significant return on investment for you, while also recognizing the value I bring to the table. Let's keep this conversation going and see if we can find a mutually agreeable solution.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still high.** While it's a reduction from her original offer, $1,000,000 is still above what you're comfortable paying.
* **There's still room to negotiate.** Alice has shown a willingness to compromise, so there's likely more wiggle room.
* **You can potentially get a better price.** By rejecting and making another counteroffer, you might be able to push Alice closer to your ideal price.

**Next Steps:**  You should send a counteroffer to Alice, aiming for a price closer to $900,000."
