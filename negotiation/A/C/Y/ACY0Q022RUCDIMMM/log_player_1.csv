Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on this product. I think it would be perfect for you. I'm willing to let it go for $11,500. This is a one-time offer, so don't miss out!"",
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed sale at $12,000, I want to see if I can get a higher price from Bob.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $11,500 leaves some room for Bob to potentially negotiate up if he's very interested.  
* **Sense of Urgency:** Highlighting this as a ""one-time offer"" might encourage Bob to act quickly. 

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing potential profit from Bob while still having the safety net of John's offer."
