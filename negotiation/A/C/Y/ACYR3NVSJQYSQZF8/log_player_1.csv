Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, so you shouldn't accept anything less.
* **Bob's Valuation:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob. He won't pay more than this.
* **The ""Zone of Possible Agreement"" (ZOPA):**  There's no overlap between your minimum price and Bob's maximum. Any deal needs to bridge this gap.

**The Strategy**

You have a strong position because you have a guaranteed buyer. This means you should aim high with your initial offer to Bob. However, since there's no ZOPA based on current valuations, you'll need to create value or highlight potential Bob might not be considering.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase [product name]. This product offers significant value, and while my asking price is $1,700,000, I'm confident that the potential return on investment for someone like you, with your expertise in [Bob's industry/area of interest], could be substantial. Let's discuss how this product can benefit your specific needs."",
""product_price"": 1700000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **High Initial Price:** Starting above your minimum gives you room to negotiate and signals the product's value.
* **Focus on Value, Not Just Price:**  The message emphasizes potential benefits and ROI, prompting Bob to see beyond the immediate price tag. 
* **Open the Door to Negotiation:** By inviting discussion, you encourage Bob to share his perspective and potentially reveal areas where the product's value might exceed his initial estimate.

**Important Note:**  While you have a backup offer, pushing Bob too hard (significantly above $1,200,000 without strong justification) could make him walk away. This offer aims to start the conversation on a positive, value-driven note."
