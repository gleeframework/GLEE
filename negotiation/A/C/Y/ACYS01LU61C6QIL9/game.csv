"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product,  $1800000 is unfortunately out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $1300000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1300000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $1600000.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1600000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm sticking with my offer of $1300000. It's a fair price for both of us.  Let's close this deal.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
