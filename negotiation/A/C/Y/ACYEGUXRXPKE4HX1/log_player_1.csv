{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $130. It's a great deal and I'm sure you'll find it very useful."", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price slightly above the minimum I'm willing to accept. It's a good starting point to see if Bob is interested in paying more than my minimum value for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $130 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $110. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $110 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm willing to negotiate further to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $110 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down a little.  How about $115?  That's still a good price for you and a fair deal for me."", ""product_price"": 115}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $115 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. How about $108? I'm willing to meet you halfway. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $108
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $108 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $120.  While I'm open to negotiating, I don't want to risk getting stuck with a price lower than my minimum.  Selling to John for $120 guarantees me my desired value."
