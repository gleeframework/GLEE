"I understand that you're looking for a fair price, Bob. However, my initial offer was already a generous one. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to ensure I get a price that reflects the product's value to me. I'm willing to compromise at $950,000, but I'm not going any lower than that.",950000.0,Alice,3,,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer,
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $950,000 is still above my target price.  I'm prepared to go up to $825,000. This is a significant step toward meeting your needs while still remaining within my budget. Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",825000.0,Bob,4,,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I'm not willing to go all the way to $825,000. I'm willing to compromise at $920,000, which is still a good price considering the product's value to me. Let's see if we can meet in the middle this time.",920000.0,Alice,5,,
