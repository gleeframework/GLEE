{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your budget. It makes sense to reject the offer and try to negotiate a better price. You have 10 rounds to work with, and you know you can get the product for $10,000 from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a relatively aggressive counteroffer, but still within the realm of possibility given Alice's value of $12,000. I'm aiming for a quick deal, but leaving room for negotiation in case Alice needs to counter."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above my maximum budget. I'll continue to negotiate for a better price.  Although I can buy from John for $10,000, there's a chance I can still get a better deal with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10750}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down in price, but I'm still trying to get a better deal. I'm increasing my counteroffer slightly, hoping to find a middle ground.  I'm also aware that I have a fallback option with John, so I'm not feeling pressured to settle for a price I'm not comfortable with."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to my maximum budget, I'm still hoping to get a better deal. I have several rounds left and know I can get the product for $10,000 from John if I need to. I'll continue negotiating for a lower price."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10900}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is showing a willingness to negotiate. I'm increasing my counteroffer again, but still keeping it below my maximum budget. I'm hoping that this offer will be appealing enough for Alice to accept, but I'm prepared to continue negotiating if necessary."
