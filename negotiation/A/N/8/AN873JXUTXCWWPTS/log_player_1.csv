"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than what I believe the product is worth to Bob. This sets a high bar for him and leaves room for negotiation. I want to see if I can get him to come closer to my minimum asking price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum asking price of $12,000. While I could sell to John now for $12,000, I'd like to see if I can negotiate a better price with Bob.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11500}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly, but still aiming for a price above my minimum. I'm trying to find a middle ground that might be appealing to Bob while still maximizing my profits."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is slightly better than his previous one, it's still significantly below my minimum asking price. I'd like to see if I can push him further.  I'm going to counteroffer again in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000} 
```

I'm lowering my price again, trying to find a sweet spot where Bob might be willing to buy. I'm still above my minimum, but I'm starting to feel the pressure of the limited rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,900
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

We're nearing the end of the rounds, and while Bob has moved closer to my asking price, it's still not high enough. I'm worried that if I keep rejecting his offers, I might end up with nothing. It's time to take the guaranteed $12,000 from John."
