Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I think would be perfect for you! It's worth at least $15,000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a fantastic deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:**  I've chosen $12,000. This is a price that's significantly lower than my minimum desired price of $15,000, making it appealing to Bob.
* **Message:** I've framed the message to emphasize the value of the product and the potential savings for Bob. 

This strategy aims to:

* **Maximize profit:**  While $12,000 is less than my ideal $15,000, it's still a good profit considering the value to Bob.
* **Increase likelihood of acceptance:** The price is appealing enough to make Bob seriously consider the offer. 
* **Provide a fallback option:**  I have John lined up, ensuring a sale even if Bob declines."
