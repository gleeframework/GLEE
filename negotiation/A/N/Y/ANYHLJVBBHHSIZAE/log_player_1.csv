"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd love. My initial offer is $100. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that is slightly above Bob's value for the product, hoping to leave room for negotiation.  This is a good starting point to gauge Bob's interest."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $90 is better than nothing, I'm still confident I can get a better price. I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $90 is still a little too low for me. How about $95? It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'm willing to go up to $92. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm still holding out for a slightly better price.  $92 is getting close to my minimum, but I think I can push for a bit more.  I'll make a counteroffer and see how it goes."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting close!  How about we split the difference and meet at $93?  This feels like a fair compromise for both of us."", ""product_price"": 93}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm close, but I'm still not comfortable with $93. Can we try $91? It's a small concession, but I think it's worth it to get the product 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $91. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $91
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd love to hold out for $93, it's getting late in the negotiation. Bob is clearly not going to budge much further, and selling to John for $120 is always an option.  $91 is a decent price, and it's better than risking the deal falling through altogether."
