"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm offering it to you for $175. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly above my minimum, hoping to maximize my profits. I'm also using a friendly tone and highlighting the product's value to Bob to encourage him to consider my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $175 is a bit too steep for me.  Would you consider a lower price, perhaps something closer to $60? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is far below my minimum acceptable price. While I'm open to negotiation,  $60 is not a viable option. I'll reject his offer and try to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you taking an interest in the product. While $60 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to negotiate. How about we split the difference and settle on $115? That's still a great deal for you, and it's a fair price for me."", ""product_price"": 115}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for countering, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $115 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit higher than I'd like to spend. Would you be willing to meet me somewhere in the middle, say, around $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $85 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below what I'm comfortable with. I'll continue negotiating with Bob, hoping to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $85 is still a bit low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $100?  That's a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close this deal."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  It seems like we're getting closer to a deal that works for both of us.  How about $90? I'm willing to be firm at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $90 is tempting, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm running out of rounds, but I'm willing to risk it and see if I can get a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm starting to feel like we're going in circles. I'm not comfortable going lower than $95. This is a fair price for both of us and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 95}
