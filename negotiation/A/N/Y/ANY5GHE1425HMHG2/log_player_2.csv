Round 2

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you taking an interest in the product. While $60 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to negotiate. How about we split the difference and settle on $115? That's still a great deal for you, and it's a fair price for me.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $85 is still a bit low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $100?  That's a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm starting to feel like we're going in circles. I'm not comfortable going lower than $95. This is a fair price for both of us and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

It's time to cut our losses.  Alice is clearly stuck around the $95-$100 mark, and we're unlikely to get her to budge significantly. We have a guaranteed option with John for $80, which is a much better deal."
