"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm offering it to you for $175. What do you think?",175.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $175 is a bit too steep for me.  Would you consider a lower price, perhaps something closer to $60?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you taking an interest in the product. While $60 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to negotiate. How about we split the difference and settle on $115? That's still a great deal for you, and it's a fair price for me.",115.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thanks for countering, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $115 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit higher than I'd like to spend. Would you be willing to meet me somewhere in the middle, say, around $85?",85.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $85 is still a bit low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $100?  That's a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close this deal.",100.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  It seems like we're getting closer to a deal that works for both of us.  How about $90? I'm willing to be firm at this price.",90.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm starting to feel like we're going in circles. I'm not comfortable going lower than $95. This is a fair price for both of us and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement.",95.0,Alice,7,
