"Alice, thanks for the offer! I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However,  $1,200,000 is a bit higher than my initial budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for it. Let's see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,050,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $1,150,000. This is a very competitive price, and I'm confident you'll find it hard to find a better deal elsewhere. Let me know what you think!",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,150,000 is still a bit outside my comfort zone. I'm confident we can find a middle ground.  I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us both to come to an agreement.  Let's make this happen!",1100000.0,Bob,4,
