"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hey Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product and think you'd really appreciate it. I'm offering it to you for $95. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $95 is better than $100, you can likely get a better price.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate it, but $95 is a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $85.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 85}
