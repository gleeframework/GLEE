"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this product.  Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,000,000. I'm confident this is a fair starting point for discussions.",1000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your initial offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,000,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a price of $600,000. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the product's value.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand you see value in the product, but $600,000 significantly undervalues its true worth.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This reflects the product's exceptional quality and potential.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $900,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and propose a price of $750,000. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the product's value and my budget.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, it seems we're getting closer. I appreciate your willingness to find a middle ground.  To bridge the gap, I'm proposing $850,000. This feels like a fair price that acknowledges the true value of what's being offered.",850000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $850,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to make one more concession and propose a price of $775,000. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the product's value and my financial constraints.",775000.0,Bob,6,
