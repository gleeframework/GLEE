"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time, Alice. I'm willing to pay $11,500 for the product. That's the highest I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $11,500 is too low for me, and I'm hoping to get closer to my asking price.  I'll try to counter with a price that's more reasonable for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your offer. However, $11,500 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13,000, which is still a great price for you considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but I still think $12,200 is a fair price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I don't think I can go any higher. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $12,200 is close to my minimum asking price of $12,000.  While I would prefer to get closer to my initial offer of $14,000, accepting this offer is still a good deal. It's better to secure the sale now and avoid the risk of further negotiations or selling to John for a lower price."
