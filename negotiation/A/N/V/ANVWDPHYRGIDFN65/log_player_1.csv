"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the potential of this product, $1,150,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to offer $1,050,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{

While Bob's offer is tempting, I'm confident I can negotiate a better price. I'm willing to go lower, but not that low yet.  We still have plenty of rounds to go."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your perspective on the value, but $1,110,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,080,000.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000. 
You have three options:

We're getting closer, but I believe I can still get a better deal.  Bob is showing willingness to move up, so I'll continue negotiating."

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer, but $1,095,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $1,085,000.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,085,000.
