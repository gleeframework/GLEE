"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the potential of this product, $1,150,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to offer $1,050,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I believe the value of this product is significantly higher than that.  Let's meet somewhere in the middle. How about $1,110,000?",1110000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective on the value, but $1,110,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,080,000.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1080000.0,Bob,4,
