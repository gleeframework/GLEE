Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm starting high, at $110, knowing Bob values the product at $80. This gives me room to negotiate if needed, while still being above my minimum acceptable price of $100."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While $80 is better than nothing, it's below my minimum acceptable price of $100.  I'll counteroffer in the next round, hoping to find a compromise closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 95}
```

I'm counter-offering at $95. This is still above my minimum of $100, but a significant drop from my initial offer.  I'm hoping Bob will see this as a good compromise and accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $85 is closer to my minimum, it's still not a good deal for me.  Given that John is willing to pay $100, I'm going to sell the product to him. It's important to stick to your principles and not settle for less than you're comfortable with."
