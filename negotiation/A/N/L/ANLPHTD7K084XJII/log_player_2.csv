"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $13,500 is a better price than John's $15,000, Bob should try to negotiate further.  There's room to get a lower price, as the product is worth $12,000 to Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a price closer to Alice's valuation of $12,000. This counteroffer is a significant step down from Alice's offer, but still within Bob's acceptable range. It leaves room for further negotiation while expressing Bob's willingness to reach a deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $14,000 is still higher than Bob's preferred price point.  While it is better than John's offer, Bob should continue negotiating to see if he can get a better price.  The remaining rounds should be enough to potentially reach a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to meet Alice halfway. This offer is a compromise between his previous offer and Alice's latest offer.  It's a good move to show his willingness to find common ground while still keeping the price within his budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $14,500 is still higher than Bob's preferred price point, and there are still rounds left. Bob should continue negotiating to see if he can get a better price. While John's offer is a fallback option, it's better to see if Bob can get a better deal with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is again trying to meet Alice halfway. This offer is a compromise between his previous offer and Alice's latest offer. It's a good move to show his willingness to find common ground while still keeping the price within his budget. With only 4 rounds left, Bob needs to show he's serious about closing the deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $15,000 is now equal to John's offer. There are only a few rounds left, and there is no guarantee that Alice will budge further. It's more efficient to take John's offer and secure the product without risking further negotiation.  The time constraint is now a significant factor, as there's no guarantee that Alice will accept a lower price."
