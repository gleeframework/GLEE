"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 

I'm starting high, at $1,750,000.  This is above Bob's perceived value, but it leaves room for negotiation. I'm confident I can get a better price than John's offer, but I want to see if Bob is willing to play ball."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is way too low.  While I want to close a deal, I'm not willing to settle for that much less than what I need. I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

I'm lowering my price to $1,600,000. It's still above Bob's initial offer, but it shows I'm willing to negotiate. I'm hoping this will be a more reasonable price for him while still giving me a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low. I'm not willing to sell for that much less than John's offer. I'll make another counteroffer. I need to keep pushing for a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1450000}
```

I'm dropping my price again to $1,450,000. This is a significant concession, but I still feel like I can get a better deal than John's offer. It's getting late in the game, but I want to see if Bob is willing to meet me in the middle."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell to John.  We're getting too close to the end of negotiations, and Bob isn't willing to come up to a price I'm comfortable with. While I'd love to get more than $1,500,000, I don't want to risk losing out on the sale entirely. It's time to cut my losses and go with the guaranteed offer."
