Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,000,000 from John, so you won't accept anything less.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,200,000, meaning there's a potential profit margin of $200,000.
* **One-Shot Deal:** You only have one chance to make a deal with Bob.

**Strategy**

You want to aim for a price that's:

* **Attractive to Bob:** It needs to be below his perceived value of $1,200,000.
* **Profitable for You:** It should be significantly above your $1,000,000 baseline.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  I believe it holds significant value for your business, and I'm confident you'll find this a worthwhile investment. I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Strong Opening:** The message emphasizes the product's value and exclusivity.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $1,150,000 leaves Bob with a potential profit of $50,000, making it a tempting offer.  
* **Your Profit:** You secure a $150,000 profit, significantly more than your fallback option.

**Important Note:** While this is a strong starting point, negotiation is dynamic. Bob's response might require you to adjust your offer slightly."
