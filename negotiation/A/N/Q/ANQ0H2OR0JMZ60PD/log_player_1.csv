Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm asking for $10,000 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Offering $10,000 is a good starting point. It's higher than Bob's perceived value, but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** A potential counteroffer from Bob at a lower price is expected,  and there's room for me to negotiate without dropping below my minimum of $12,000. 
* **Positive Framing:**  The message is positive and emphasizes the potential value of the product for Bob.

**Next Steps:**

I'll be prepared to negotiate based on Bob's response. If he rejects my offer, I'll consider his counteroffer and how much I'm willing to lower my price.  If his offer is too low, I'll make a counteroffer.  If we can't come to an agreement, I'll have the option of selling to John for my minimum price of $12,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $8,500 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. Accepting it would result in a significant financial loss.
* **Negotiation is still possible:**  While Bob's offer is low, he is showing interest in the product. This means there's potential for further negotiation to reach a price that's closer to my desired range.
* **Selling to John is a fallback:**  If negotiations with Bob fail, I can always sell to John for $12,000. This provides me with a safety net and ensures I don't have to settle for a price that's too low.

**Next Steps:**

I will make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming to find a middle ground. My counteroffer will be higher than $8,500 but lower than my initial offer of $10,000. The goal is to bridge the gap and reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $8,500 is a bit lower than I'd hoped for, I'm willing to come down to $9,500. This price still reflects the value of the product, and I believe it's fair to both of us.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bridging the Gap:**  My counteroffer of $9,500  is a compromise, moving closer to Bob's offer while remaining above my minimum. 
* **Maintaining Value:**  I'm still emphasizing the value of the product, suggesting it's worth more than Bob's initial offer.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The message is open-ended, inviting Bob to continue the discussion and potentially negotiate further.

**Next Steps:**

I'm prepared to respond to Bob's reaction to my counteroffer. If he rejects it, I'll consider his next counteroffer and decide if I'm willing to lower my price further. However, if his offer remains too low, I'll  opt to sell to John for my minimum price of $12,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I think $9,000 is a fair price. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to My Minimum:**  $9,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  
* **Risk of Losing the Deal:**  If I reject Bob's offer and try to counteroffer again, there's a chance he'll walk away from the deal.
* **Opportunity Cost:**  While selling to John for $12,000 is ideal, it involves a risk.  Bob is clearly interested in the product, and I might lose him if I keep pushing for a higher price.

**Next Steps:**

I'll accept Bob's offer of $9,000. While it's not my ideal price, it's a good deal considering the risk of losing the sale altogether. I've secured a sale, and I can still move on to other opportunities."
