Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1800000}
```

This offer starts high, leaving room for negotiation while still exceeding your minimum desired value. It also signals that you are confident in the product's worth."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum desired value. I will reject his offer and attempt to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
``` 

This counteroffer is still higher than Bob's offer but is a compromise from my initial offer.  It demonstrates a willingness to negotiate while still maintaining a reasonable price for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum desired value, and further negotiation might not yield a better outcome. It's more beneficial to sell to John at this point, as he's willing to pay my minimum desired value, ensuring a successful transaction."
