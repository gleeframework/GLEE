Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11500. It's a great deal, and I believe it's worth every penny. What do you think?

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $11,500 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,500. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $11,000 is still a bit high for me. Let's meet in the middle at $10,750. This is a fair price, and it gives us both a good deal."", ""product_price"": 10750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm willing to go a little lower, but $10750 is still too far from my desired price.  Let's try $11000.  This is a fair compromise that allows us both to get a good deal. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

Alice is not willing to go down to your desired price, and you've already had 5 rounds of negotiation. You can get the product from John for a better price than Alice's latest offer. It's time to move on."
