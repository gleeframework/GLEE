"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I'm willing to go a little lower, but $10750 is still too far from my desired price.  Let's try $11000.  This is a fair compromise that allows us both to get a good deal. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,5,
