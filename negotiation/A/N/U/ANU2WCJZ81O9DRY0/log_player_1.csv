"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the potential sale of this product.  Given its unique value and the benefits it offers, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000.  I believe this reflects its true worth.  What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 2300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** We begin with a strong anchor price significantly above both our valuation and Bob's perceived value.  This leaves room for negotiation and allows us to gauge Bob's interest level. 
* **Justification:**  The message emphasizes the ""unique value"" without being specific.  This is to pique Bob's interest and encourage him to counter with his own perceived value. 
* **Alternative Option (John):**  We keep the option of selling to John in mind as a potential fallback.

This strategy aims to:

1. **Maximize Potential Profit:** If Bob accepts the high anchor, we win big.
2. **Drive Negotiation:** Encourage Bob to counter-offer and reveal more about how much he might be willing to pay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the value you see in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. This is my highest offer for now. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Gap:** Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is still considerably lower than our minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Negotiating Position:** While it's a substantial jump from his perceived value, we're only in round 2. Rejecting this offer signals that we're serious about the product's value and willing to negotiate further.
* **John as Leverage:** The guaranteed offer from John gives us a strong position. We're not desperate to accept a low offer from Bob.

We will aim to bring Bob closer to our acceptable range in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but $1,200,000 is significantly below its true value and what I'm willing to accept.  To move this forward, I'm proposing $1,900,000. This price reflects the unique benefits this product offers and leaves room for us to reach a mutually agreeable outcome."", 
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:**  While we want to move closer to our minimum price, we also want to show flexibility.  This counteroffer is roughly halfway between our initial ask and Bob's offer.
* **Reiterating Value:** We again vaguely mention the ""unique benefits,"" subtly reminding Bob of the value he might be undervaluing.
* **Urgency:**  The phrase ""to move this forward""  implies that we have other options (John) and time is a factor.

This strategy aims to:

1. **Encourage a Counter:** This offer is more reasonable but still leaves room for negotiation, prompting Bob to make a move towards our desired range.
2. **Maintain Value:** We avoid devaluing the product by not dropping the price too drastically."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so I'm proposing $1,050,000. This is my final offer for now. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Below Minimum:** Bob's offer of $1,050,000 remains significantly below our absolute minimum of $1,500,000. Accepting would be a substantial loss.
* **""Final Offer"" Tactic:** Bob is using a common negotiation tactic to pressure us. However, it's unlikely this is truly his final offer.  
* **Time for a Stronger Stance:**  We need to signal to Bob that we're serious about our valuation and won't accept such a low offer. The presence of John as a backup buyer gives us leverage.

**Next Steps:** In the next round, we will make a counteroffer, but with a much smaller concession, and strongly imply that we're considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,050,000 simply doesn't reflect the value of this product.  I have another potential buyer who sees its true worth. However, I believe in giving you a fair chance.  I'm willing to come down to $1,750,000, but this is my absolute limit. "", 
""product_price"": 1750000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm Stance:** We're making a smaller concession this time, signaling that we're nearing our bottom line.
* **Introducing John:**  We explicitly mention the other buyer to increase pressure and demonstrate that we have alternatives. 
* **""Absolute Limit"":**  This phrase emphasizes the seriousness of our offer and aims to discourage further lowballing. 

This strategy attempts to:

1. **Elicit a Serious Response:**  By introducing competition and a firm stance, we hope to prompt Bob to offer a more reasonable counter.
2. **Maintain a Strong Position:**  We're still a significant distance from our minimum, but we're communicating that we're willing to walk away if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit far from our last offer. I'm willing to meet you at $1,450,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Above Minimum:** Bob's offer of $1,450,000 is now above our absolute minimum of $1,500,000. Accepting this offer secures a profit.
* **Strong Position Diminishing:** While we have John as an alternative, there's no guarantee future negotiations with Bob will yield a better outcome. He might be firm on this being his ""final offer."" 
* **Time Value:**  Closing the deal now avoids the risk of Bob walking away or prolonged negotiation that could be less favorable. 

It's a good business decision to accept a profitable offer rather than risk losing the deal for a relatively small potential gain."
