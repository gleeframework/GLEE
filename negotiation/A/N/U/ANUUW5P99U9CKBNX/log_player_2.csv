"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd be very interested in it.  I'm asking $9,000 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000.

Round 2

{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $9,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $6,500?"",

}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $6,500 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $8,500.  That leaves room for both of us to be happy with the deal.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice is coming down, but we're still not at a point where it makes sense to take the deal over John's offer.  We need to incentivize her to go lower."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand you're looking for a fair price, Alice.  How about we meet in the middle at $7,250? That's a significant saving for me and still a good deal for you."",

}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob,  $7,250 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference at $7,750?  That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

We're getting closer, but Alice is still asking for more than John.  Another counteroffer is needed."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. To be honest, my budget really only allows for $7,500.  If you're willing to accept that, I'm ready to close the deal right now."",
