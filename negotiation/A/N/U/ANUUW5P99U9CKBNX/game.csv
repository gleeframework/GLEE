"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $9,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $6,500?",6500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $6,500 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $8,500.  That leaves room for both of us to be happy with the deal.  Let me know what you think!",8500.0,Alice,3,

"I understand you're looking for a fair price, Alice.  How about we meet in the middle at $7,250? That's a significant saving for me and still a good deal for you.",7250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  $7,250 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference at $7,750?  That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close the deal.",7750.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. To be honest, my budget really only allows for $7,500.  If you're willing to accept that, I'm ready to close the deal right now.",7500.0,Bob,6,
