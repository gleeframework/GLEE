Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I have a very valuable product that I think would be of great interest to you. I'm offering it to you for $1,400,000. This is a significant opportunity for you to acquire something worth $1,500,000 to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Offering $1,400,000 is a good starting point. It's a high price but leaves room for negotiation, ensuring I get a good return while acknowledging Bob's perceived value.
* **Highlighting Value:**  The message emphasizes the potential value to Bob, making it more likely he'll consider the offer seriously.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The message leaves the door open for counteroffers, demonstrating flexibility without seeming desperate. 
* **Plan B:**  Knowing I can sell to John for $1,000,000 allows me to be firm in my negotiation with Bob, but also willing to walk away if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product is high, but I believe we can find a price that suits both of us. How about $1350000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** While Bob has come down from his original perceived value of $1,500,000, his offer of $1,350,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. Accepting his offer would leave me with a profit significantly less than I could get from John.
* **Opportunity for Counteroffer:** Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to counter with a price closer to my desired outcome. I still have the potential to secure a higher price, but I need to ensure I don't lose him completely. 
* **John's Offer as a Safety Net:**  Knowing John is willing to pay $1,000,000 gives me the confidence to hold out for a better offer from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm aiming for a price closer to $1,400,000.  The value of this product is truly exceptional, and I believe we can find a mutually beneficial solution. Let's meet in the middle at $1,375,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1375000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  My counteroffer is a compromise, showing flexibility while still staying above my minimum price.  
* **Appealing to Value:** I reinforce the product's value to justify the price.
* **Seeking Middle Ground:**  The message suggests finding a ""middle ground"" to make it more likely Bob will consider it.
* **Open to Further Negotiation:** I leave the door open for further discussion, but the offer is firm enough to show I'm not willing to go much lower."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. Considering the value of the product, I think we can reach an agreement closer to $1360000. I hope this proposal is acceptable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,360,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,360,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to My Minimum:**  While Bob's offer of $1,360,000 is still lower than my ideal price, it's only slightly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.
* **Potential for Further Negotiation:** Even if I accept, there's still the possibility of getting a slightly higher price in future rounds, as Bob seems willing to negotiate. 
* **Avoiding Risk:**  Rejecting Bob's offer and continuing the negotiation carries the risk that he might walk away, forcing me to sell to John at a significantly lower price. 
* **Time is Money:** Continuing to negotiate might take time, and my goal is to maximize my profit as quickly as possible.

Accepting Bob's offer ensures a relatively quick and profitable sale, minimizing risk and potentially allowing for further negotiation in the future."
