"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its potential value, I believe a price of $1,100,000 is fair.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:**  You're willing to pay up to $1,200,000, but Alice is asking for $1,100,000. This means there's room for negotiation.
* **Potential for a better deal:** By rejecting the offer, you can counter with a lower price and potentially get a better deal.  

**Next Steps:** You'll need to make a counteroffer to Alice, keeping in mind your maximum price and Alice's minimum price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity to purchase this product. However, $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:** This counteroffer is a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer,  but it's still well within your budget.
* **Negotiation Tactic:** This counteroffer sets the stage for further negotiation and shows Alice that you're serious about buying the product but are also looking for a fair price.
* **Room for Compromise:** The offer is above Alice's minimum, leaving room for her to counter if she wants to continue the negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your perspective, but the value this product brings is truly significant. How about we meet in the middle at $1,025,000? This feels like a fair compromise to me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** Alice's counteroffer is a good compromise, meeting you halfway between your previous offer and her initial offer. 
* **Value:** While it's not the absolute lowest price you could potentially get, it's still a significant saving compared to buying from John.
* **Time and Effort:**  Continuing to negotiate might save you a little more money, but it will take more time and effort.  

**Conclusion:**  Accepting Alice's offer is a good balance of price and negotiation efficiency."
