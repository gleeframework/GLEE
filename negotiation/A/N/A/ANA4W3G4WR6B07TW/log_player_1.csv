"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really enjoy it. I'm offering it to you for $100. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's lower than your minimum price but still leaves room for negotiation. It also includes a friendly message to build rapport with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I was hoping to get it for a bit less. How about $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

It's better to hold out for a higher price. While $90 is closer to your minimum, you can still try to get more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  How about we split the difference and go with $95? This is a really good product, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it."", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for considering my request, Alice. I think $90 would be a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

This is a tricky situation.  Bob is sticking to his $90 offer, and while that is close to your minimum, you've already made a counteroffer and it was rejected.  You could continue to negotiate, but it's likely that Bob will remain firm.  

Since John is willing to pay your minimum price of $120, it's the safest option to go with John and secure the best possible deal.  This avoids the risk of continued negotiation with Bob potentially ending in a lower price."
