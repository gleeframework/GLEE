"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. Is that something we can work with?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, I'm afraid $900000 is a bit lower than I was thinking. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $1100000 for it. Would you be willing to consider that?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm not sure I can go that high, Alice. I'm thinking more along the lines of $950000. Can you meet me at that price?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see you're a serious buyer, Bob. I appreciate that. However, $950000 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get at least $1050000 for it. Can you meet me at that price?",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but I'm still a bit far from being comfortable with that price. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1025000. Can we agree on that?",1025000.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I still need to make a decent profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you at $1075000, but that's as low as I can go. Can you make it work?",1075000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you at $1050000, but that's my final offer. Can you accept it?",1050000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I've already compromised quite a bit. I'm willing to meet you at $1075000 one more time, but if you're not willing to meet me there, I'm afraid I'll have to consider other options. This is my final counteroffer.",1075000.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I understand you've made a final offer, Alice, but I'm still not willing to meet you at $1075000. I'm willing to meet you at $1025000, and that's my final offer. If you're not willing to accept it, I'll have to consider buying from someone else.",1025000.0,Bob,10,
