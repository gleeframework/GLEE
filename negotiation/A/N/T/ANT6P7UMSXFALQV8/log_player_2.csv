# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

It's better to reject Alice's offer and make a counteroffer. You can potentially get a better price than $1,200,000, but still save money compared to buying from John."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $900,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the product's value. Let's see if we can make this work. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000

You should reject Alice's offer again.  While $1,050,000 is better than her first offer, you're still closer to your goal of $800,000.  It's worth continuing to negotiate to see if you can get closer to that price."
