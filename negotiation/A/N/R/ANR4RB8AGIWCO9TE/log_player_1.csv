This offer starts high, but allows some room for negotiation. I'm aiming to get as close to my minimum value ($15,000) as possible."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

Bob's offer is too low. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I won't accept anything below my minimum value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000} 
``` 

I'm lowering my price a bit, but still staying above my minimum value. This shows I'm open to negotiation, but I'm not desperate to sell at Bob's initial offer."

Bob is unwilling to budge. While I'd prefer to get a higher price, selling to John guarantees me my minimum value and avoids further negotiation."
