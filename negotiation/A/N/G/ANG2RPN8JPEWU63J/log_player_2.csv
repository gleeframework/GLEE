"Alice's offer: The product price will be $999,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $999,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 

**Explanation:**

Since the product is worth $1,000,000 to you, Alice's offer of $999,000 is a good deal. It allows you to save $1,000 and still get the product. Buying from John for $1,000,000 would be less beneficial."
