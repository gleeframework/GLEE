"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $14,000 might be a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $13,000. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll find it's still a great value. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,3,
