"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm offering you a great deal on this product, but I need to make a profit, so I'm willing to sell it to you for $150. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

Alice's offer is far too high. You can get the product for $80 from John, which is much closer to your maximum value of $80."
