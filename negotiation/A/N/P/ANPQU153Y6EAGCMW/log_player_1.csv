Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a great product I'd like to offer you. I'm asking for $100 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($80) to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Positive tone:**  A friendly message makes Bob more likely to engage.
* **Open-ended question:** Encourages Bob to respond and potentially make a counteroffer, giving me more information about his perceived value.

**Important Note:**  This is just an initial offer.  I'll need to adjust my strategy based on Bob's response and keep in mind the option of selling to John for $80 if negotiations stall."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is my minimum, I'm not in a rush to sell.  Rejecting his offer allows me to:

* **Gain more information:** By making a counteroffer, I can gauge how strongly Bob wants the product. If he's willing to go higher, I can potentially get more than $80.
* **Maintain leverage:**  By showing I'm not desperate to sell at his price, I keep the negotiation power.

**Next Steps:**

In the next round, I will make a counteroffer to Bob, likely somewhere between $80 and $100, depending on how much I think he values the product.  I'll also need to consider how long I want to continue negotiating before selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob.  I appreciate your interest.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $90.  Let's see if we can find a compromise there."", ""product_price"": 90} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing flexibility by lowering my price from the initial offer, but not going all the way down to Bob's offer. 
* **Positive tone:** Maintaining a positive tone keeps the negotiation amicable.
* **Open-ended:**  ""Let's see if we can find a compromise"" encourages further discussion and potential for a deal.

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer is a calculated risk. It depends on how much Bob wants the product.  If he's really interested, he might be willing to go a little higher. If he's firm at $80, I can always fall back to selling to John. I'm keeping the door open for a deal, but not letting Bob dictate the price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** Bob's offer is only $5 below my minimum acceptable price of $80.
* **Potential for a quick deal:** Accepting his offer ensures a quick sale and eliminates the risk of further negotiation.
* **Risk of further negotiation:**  If I reject his offer and make a counteroffer, there's a chance Bob might walk away, leaving me with only John's $80 offer.

**Conclusion:**

While I'd ideally prefer to sell for $90 or more, accepting Bob's offer of $85 is the most pragmatic choice. It guarantees a sale close to my minimum and minimizes the risk of a drawn-out negotiation."
