Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $95 is still a bit lower than my target, Bob. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $98. It's a fair compromise, and I think you'll be happy with the price.

Alice's offer of $98 is still too high for me. I'm going to go ahead and buy the product from John for $80.  While I'd prefer to buy from Alice, my goal is to save as much money as possible, and John's offer is the best deal I've been presented."
