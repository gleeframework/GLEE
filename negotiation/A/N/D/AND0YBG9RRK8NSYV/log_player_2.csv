"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,500. It's in excellent condition and worth a lot to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $14,500 is a better price than John's offer, there's still room for negotiation. By rejecting, Bob can try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $14,500 is a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $13,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 13000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position.  $13,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $13,750?  I think that's a fair price considering the value of the product to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $13,750 is closer to Bob's target price, he can still try to negotiate further. Bob's initial counteroffer of $13,000 was rejected, but Alice came down from her original asking price. This shows that there is room for further compromise.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try to squeeze out a bit more savings."
