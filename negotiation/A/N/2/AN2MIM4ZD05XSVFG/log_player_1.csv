Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $13,500. I'm open to hearing your thoughts on this."", 
""product_price"": 13500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for potential negotiation.
* **Justification:** By mentioning the ""value"" of the product, Alice subtly implies it might be worth more than Bob's perceived $10,000 valuation.
* **Open to Negotiation:** By stating she's ""open to hearing your thoughts,"" Alice encourages Bob to engage in a dialogue rather than just flatly rejecting the offer.

**Goal:**  

The aim is to gauge Bob's interest and potential for a counter-offer. Even if Bob doesn't accept $13,500, there's a chance he might counter with an amount higher than $12,000, allowing Alice to maximize her profit. If Bob rejects the offer outright, Alice has her guaranteed sale to John."
