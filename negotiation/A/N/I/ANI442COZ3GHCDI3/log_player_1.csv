{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a fantastic product that I think you'd be interested in. I'm asking for $10,000 for it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer starts with a relatively high price, leaving room for negotiation. It also emphasizes the value of the product to pique Bob's interest.  If Bob rejects, I'll assess his counteroffer and decide whether to negotiate further or sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price. There's no point in prolonging the negotiation, as I'm guaranteed to get my minimum value by accepting his offer."
