Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I agree this product has potential, but that price is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to offer $800,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000

{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 is significantly below its true value. This product delivers a unique set of benefits and I'm confident it will bring you a great return on your investment. How about we meet in the middle at $1,250,000?"",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the value this product brings, but $1,250,000 is still a stretch for my budget. I'm willing to increase my offer to $950,000. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is still significantly undercutting the product's value and my minimum acceptable price. While there's a risk he walks away, I believe I can still negotiate a better deal.  I'm willing to hold out a bit longer before resorting to selling to John."

{

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we settle at $1,000,000? This is my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob has hit his maximum price and is unlikely to budge. While $1,000,000 is a good offer, I have a guaranteed offer from John for $1,200,000. It makes more financial sense to take the guaranteed profit and sell to John."
