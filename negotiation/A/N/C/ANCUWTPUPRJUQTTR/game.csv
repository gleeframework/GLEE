"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product and understand your perspective on the price. However, $900,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to ensure a fair return on my investment. How about we split the difference and settle on $1,000,000? This price still leaves room for both of us to benefit from this transaction.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still interested in the product, but I'm not willing to go all the way up to $1,000,000. I'm thinking more along the lines of $950,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",950000.0,Bob,4,
