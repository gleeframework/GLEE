Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product and understand your perspective on the price. However, $900,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to ensure a fair return on my investment. How about we split the difference and settle on $1,000,000? This price still leaves room for both of us to benefit from this transaction.
