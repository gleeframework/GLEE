Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be highly beneficial to you. I'm willing to part with it for $9,500. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 9500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed buyer at $10,000, trying to get a higher price from Bob is worth attempting.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $9,500 is a strong starting point. It's considerably more than Bob's perceived value ($8,000) but leaves room for negotiation if he pushes back. 
* **""Exclusive Opportunity""**: This phrasing adds a sense of urgency and value, potentially making Bob more inclined to accept."
