"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling this product to you. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,000,000. I'm confident that this price reflects its true worth and the benefits it will bring you.",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, $2,000,000 is a bit high for my budget. I'd be willing to offer $1,000,000 to start negotiations.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However,  $1,000,000 is considerably below its true value. To find a middle ground, I propose a price of $1,750,000. This reflects its worth while acknowledging your budget considerations.",1750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the adjusted offer. I'm getting closer to finding a price point that works for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,250,000?",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see we are making progress.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but $1,250,000 is still too low.  How about $1,600,000? This price reflects the significant value this product holds.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $1,600,000 is still a bit steep for me. To be honest, my absolute top end is $1,350,000.  If we can make a deal work around there, I'm ready to buy today.",1350000.0,Bob,6,
