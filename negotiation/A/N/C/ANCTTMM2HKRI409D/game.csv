"I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product. I believe it's worth a significant investment for you. I'm willing to start with an offer of $1,400,000.",1400000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in this product, $1,400,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'd be happy to consider a price closer to $1,250,000.  What do you think?",1250000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1,250,000 is a bit lower than my target, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a discount, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for the product. How about we meet at $1,350,000?",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $1,350,000 is still a bit more than I'd like to pay. Let's see if we can bridge the gap further.  How about $1,300,000?  I think this price reflects the value of the product and is fair for both of us.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to ensure I don't go too low. How about we meet at $1,320,000? This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price for the product.",1320000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm getting closer to my goal price.  While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,320,000 is still a bit high. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $1,310,000? This would be a good compromise, and I'd be happy to finalize the deal.",1310000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're getting close to the end of our negotiation window, and I'd like to ensure I get the best possible price for the product. I'm willing to meet you at $1,320,000, but I need you to commit to the deal. If not, I'll have to explore other options. Let's make a final offer at $1,320,000, and if you're still not interested, I'll have to consider other buyers.",1320000.0,Alice,7,
