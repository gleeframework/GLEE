# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob wants to save as much money as possible, and Alice's offer is still too high.  It's worth exploring a counteroffer to see if they'll budge."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in this product, $1,400,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'd be happy to consider a price closer to $1,250,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $1,250,000 is a bit lower than my target, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a discount, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for the product. How about we meet at $1,350,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob is still trying to save as much as possible, and $1,350,000 is closer to John's price, but still above his ideal. He can likely get a better deal by continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $1,350,000 is still a bit more than I'd like to pay. Let's see if we can bridge the gap further.  How about $1,300,000?  I think this price reflects the value of the product and is fair for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to ensure I don't go too low. How about we meet at $1,320,000? This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,320,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,320,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Bob is still hoping to get a slightly better price. Even though Alice is getting closer to his ideal, there's still some room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm getting closer to my goal price.  While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,320,000 is still a bit high. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $1,310,000? This would be a good compromise, and I'd be happy to finalize the deal."", ""product_price"": 1310000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're getting close to the end of our negotiation window, and I'd like to ensure I get the best possible price for the product. I'm willing to meet you at $1,320,000, but I need you to commit to the deal. If not, I'll have to explore other options. Let's make a final offer at $1,320,000, and if you're still not interested, I'll have to consider other buyers. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,320,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,320,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob has already made multiple counteroffers and is getting closer to his target price. However, Alice is now putting pressure on him with her ""final offer"" and the threat of exploring other options. It's clear that Bob won't be able to get the product for his ideal price, and it's getting risky to continue negotiating. Buying from John at $1,200,000 is the best option at this point, securing the product at a price he's comfortable with and avoiding further risk of losing the deal with Alice."
