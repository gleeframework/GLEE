"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $120 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $100 for it.  Let me know what you think.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $120 might be a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $100. How about we meet in the middle at $110? It's still a great deal for you, and I'm willing to compromise to make a sale.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $110 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay.  How about we settle at $105?  That's a fair price for both of us.",105.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $105 is still a bit high for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $105. How about we try $107? It's still a good compromise, and I'm willing to meet you halfway.",107.0,Alice,5,
