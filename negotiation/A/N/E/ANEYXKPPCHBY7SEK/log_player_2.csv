Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this amazing product with you! I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal, considering its value to you is $8,000. I think we can both benefit from this transaction. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000.

Alice's offer is $4,000 higher than my maximum budget. It's worth trying to negotiate a better price before going with John."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. However, $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product.  This would still be a good deal for you, considering your value for it.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to lower the price to $10,500. This is still a great deal for both of us, considering the product's value to you.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial offer, it's still higher than what I'm willing to pay. It's worth trying to negotiate a little further before potentially going with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. However, $10,500 is still too high for me.  Let's split the difference. I'm happy to pay $9,750 for the product. This is a fair price for both of us and I'm confident we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 9750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your perspective, Bob, and I'm willing to make another concession. However, I'm not willing to go all the way to $9,750. I'm willing to meet you halfway from $10,500, which is $10,250. This is still a good deal for me, considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is still offering a price that's more than $2,000 higher than my maximum budget.  With only 5 rounds left, I'm not confident we can get to a price I'm comfortable with. Buying from John guarantees me the product at my desired price, and I don't want to risk running out of time."
