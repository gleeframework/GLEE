"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am excited to offer you our premium product at an exclusive price tailored just for you. Considering its immense value and the fact that it is worth $15,000 to you, I propose we strike a deal at $12,000. This offer represents a fantastic opportunity to secure such a valuable item at a highly favorable price. Please let me know if this proposal meets your expectations and if you wish to proceed with the purchase. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to inflate the perceived value by claiming it's worth $15,000 to me. While I'm willing to spend up to that amount, her starting price of $12,000 leaves room for negotiation. Rejecting her offer might lead to a better counter-offer closer to her $10,000 valuation."
