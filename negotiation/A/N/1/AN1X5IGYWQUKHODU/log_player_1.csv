Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe would be incredibly valuable to you. Given its potential worth, I'm initially offering it for $1,150,000."", ""product_price"": 1150000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm beginning the negotiation with a strong offer slightly below Bob's perceived value. This leaves room for negotiation while aiming to secure a significant profit. 
* **Alternative Option:** I have the safety net of John's offer ($1,000,000), so I'm not pressured to accept a low offer from Bob.
* **Encouraging Negotiation:** By starting with a strong but not outrageous offer, I encourage Bob to counter and engage in a negotiation that could lead to a mutually beneficial outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but your asking price is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $950,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $950,000 is significantly lower than both my desired price and his own perceived value. Accepting this offer would mean leaving a lot of money on the table. While I'm open to negotiation, this offer is too low to accept outright. I'll provide a counteroffer that moves the negotiation closer to a mutually acceptable range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I understand your initial offer, the value of this product is substantial.  I could consider coming down to $1,075,000. This feels like a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 1075000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** Bob's offer was quite low. This counteroffer significantly reduces my initial price but keeps the deal beneficial for me. It aims for a price point closer to the middle ground between our positions.
* **Firm but Flexible:** The message conveys a willingness to negotiate while emphasizing the product's inherent value. I'm showing flexibility but remaining firm on a price that makes financial sense.
* **Keeping John in Mind:** I still have the option to sell to John for $1,000,000, so I won't go drastically lower unless Bob makes a compelling move."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $1,075,000 is getting closer, but I'm aiming for something under $1,000,000.  Would you be willing to do $980,000?  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $980,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob is stubbornly staying below my minimum acceptable price. His latest offer of $980,000, while closer to $1,000,000,  is not worth the risk of continuing the negotiation. He's shown a reluctance to move substantially from his position. Selling to John for $1,000,000 is a guaranteed profit and avoids further time and effort spent haggling with Bob."
