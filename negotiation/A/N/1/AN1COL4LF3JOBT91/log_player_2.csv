"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this exclusive product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to make a competitive offer to get us started: $900000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While Alice's initial offer is good, there's room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to start making counteroffers and potentially get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. It's a good starting point. I'm interested in the product, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. I'd be willing to offer $850,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but reasonable:** Bob is aiming for a significant price reduction, but not so low that it's likely to be immediately rejected.
* **Sets a clear expectation:** Bob explicitly states his desired price, making it clear what he's willing to pay.
* **Friendly tone:** Maintaining a positive tone keeps the negotiation open and collaborative."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $850000. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. I'm thinking of $880000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $880,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $880,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is a step closer to Bob's desired price, there's still room for negotiation. Bob can continue to try and push for a lower price by rejecting the offer and making another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down a bit, Alice.  While $880,000 is getting closer, I'm still hoping to find a price point that works for both of us. I'm willing to go to $860,000. This would allow me to move forward with the purchase and still be within my budget."", ""product_price"": 860000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small step:** Bob is showing willingness to compromise but not giving up his desired price too quickly. A $20,000 increase from his previous offer is a smaller increment, indicating he's nearing his limit.
* **Focus on mutual benefit:** Bob frames his offer as a way to find a price that works for both of them, keeping the negotiation amicable. 
* **Reinforces budget constraints:**  Mentioning his budget helps Alice understand his limitations and motivates her to be more flexible."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to get to a price that works for both of us, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair deal. I'm thinking of $870000. This is the lowest I can go, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $870,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $870,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant progress:** Alice has moved closer to Bob's desired price, and the difference is now only $10,000.
* **Potential for deadlock:**  Continuing to negotiate might result in Alice becoming more stubborn, and Bob might risk getting stuck at a price closer to $900,000. 
* **Cost vs. Risk:** While a slightly lower price is ideal, the potential for a long negotiation and risk of a higher price with John makes accepting Alice's offer a safer choice."
