# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,300,000. It's a great price, considering the value you'll get out of it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000

``` 

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $1,300,000 is better than buying from John for $1,500,000. Even though you could potentially negotiate with Alice further, accepting her offer saves you $200,000."
