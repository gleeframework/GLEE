"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I am excited to present our premium product to you. It's an exceptional opportunity that aligns well with your needs and interests. I understand its value to you is $12,000, but considering its unique features and benefits, I believe we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. I am offering it to you today at a special introductory price of $14,000. This is a limited-time offer, so I encourage you to consider this proposal carefully. Should you have any questions or need more information, please let me know. I look forward to the possibility of working with you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $14,000 is higher than your maximum budget of $12,000. You have a guaranteed option to buy the product from John for $12,000.  Therefore, it makes more financial sense to reject Alice's offer and buy from John."
