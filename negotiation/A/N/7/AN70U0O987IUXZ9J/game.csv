"I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. However, I've got to make a living, and I need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $13,500 for the product. It's a fair price, considering the value it brings to the table.",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $13,500 is still a bit high for my budget. I'm willing to go up to $10,500, which I believe is a fair compromise.",10500.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're trying to get the best deal, Bob. However, I've already compromised significantly from my initial offer. I'm willing to meet you at $11,000, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. It's still a great price for a product of this value.",11000.0,Alice,5,
