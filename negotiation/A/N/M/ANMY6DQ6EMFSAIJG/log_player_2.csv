Alice's offer:

I'll offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's a fair price considering the value the product brings to you.

**Reasoning:** Alice is not budging significantly from her initial offers. It's clear she's aiming for a price well above your $800,000 limit. It's unlikely further negotiation will bridge the gap, and you risk missing out on John's guaranteed offer."
