"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 150}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $150. This is a reasonable starting point, leaving room for negotiation but still above my minimum value.  I'm confident that Bob will likely counteroffer, giving us the opportunity to find a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $120 is my minimum, I'm not willing to settle for that just yet.  There's still room for negotiation, and I'm hoping to get closer to my original asking price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 140}
``` 

I'm lowering my price to $140.  This shows good faith and a willingness to compromise, while still leaving room for negotiation and keeping the price above my minimum. I believe this is a fair offer that will likely lead to a quick and successful conclusion."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $130 is a good compromise. It's higher than John's offer, and I'm confident I can get a better price if I continue the negotiations, but I'd rather take the guaranteed $130 now.  It's getting late in the game, and I don't want to risk losing out on any deal."
