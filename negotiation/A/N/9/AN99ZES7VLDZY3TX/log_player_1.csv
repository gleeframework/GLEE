Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $100. This is a reasonable starting point, as it's higher than my minimum acceptable price but leaves room for negotiation. I'm hoping Bob will find the product valuable enough to pay this price, but I'm prepared to negotiate if he doesn't."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
 
Bob's offer of $90 is close to my minimum acceptable price of $80, and I'm confident that I can find another buyer for a similar price if I reject his offer. However, there's a risk of losing the deal altogether if I keep rejecting offers. To minimize the risk, I will accept Bob's offer."
