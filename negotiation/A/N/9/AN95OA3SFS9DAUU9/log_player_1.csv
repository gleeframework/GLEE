"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price above Bob's perceived value but still below my minimum. This gives me room to negotiate and leaves Bob feeling like he can get a good deal.
* **Message:** The message is friendly but firm, highlighting the product's value to Bob while setting an expectation for a potential negotiation. 

This strategy aims to initiate a negotiation while maintaining a position of strength. We'll see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer is a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $1200000 for your product. This is a fair price given my budget and the value of the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000). Accepting it would leave me with a substantial loss.  

* **Rejecting Bob's Offer:** It's crucial to maintain my negotiating position and signal that I won't settle for a price that undervalues the product.  
* **Moving Forward:** By rejecting his offer, I can proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer that hopefully brings us closer to a mutually acceptable agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,200,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. This is a fair price that acknowledges both our needs. Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1600000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-Offer:** My counteroffer is $1,600,000, which is still above Bob's offer but significantly lower than my initial price.  This shows I'm willing to negotiate but not at the expense of my minimum acceptable value.
* **Message:** The message acknowledges Bob's constraints while emphasizing the product's value and the need for a mutually beneficial agreement. 

By making a reasonable counteroffer, I aim to keep the negotiation moving forward and hopefully reach a deal before I need to resort to selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1600000 is still too high for me.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $1200000. This price reflects the product's value to me, and it's the most I can realistically pay.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is stubbornly refusing to budge from his $1,200,000 offer, which is far below my minimum. While I appreciate his willingness to negotiate, I'm not willing to sacrifice that much value.  

* **Rejecting Bob's Offer:** By rejecting his offer, I maintain my stance and demonstrate my commitment to getting a fair price. 
* **Moving Forward:**  I still have rounds remaining to try and reach a better agreement. I can make a counteroffer again in the next round, potentially trying to meet him halfway or exploring other compromises. 

It's a delicate balance. I want to avoid selling to John if possible, as that's my absolute minimum. However, I won't settle for a deal that leaves me feeling like I've been taken advantage of."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,200,000 simply doesn't reflect the value of this product.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,400,000.  This is a significant compromise on my end, but it allows us both to achieve our goals.  Let's make this deal work."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering $1,400,000, which is a compromise halfway between my previous offer ($1,600,000) and Bob's offer ($1,200,000). This demonstrates a willingness to negotiate and find a solution that works for both of us. 
* **Focus on Benefits:**  I'm framing the offer as a way for both of us to achieve our goals.  This emphasizes the potential win-win situation and encourages Bob to consider my proposal more seriously. 

By making this counteroffer, I'm hoping to show Bob that I'm serious about finding a solution but also that I won't be taken advantage of.  I'm hoping that this move will finally lead to an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $1400000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm willing to go up to $1300000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to me and my budget constraints.  Let's finalize this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is a step closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below the $1,500,000 threshold.  Accepting this offer would leave me with a loss, which I'm not willing to accept. 

* **Rejecting Bob's Offer:** By rejecting, I continue to maintain my stance and signal that I'm not willing to settle for a price that undervalues the product. 
* **Moving Forward:** I still have rounds remaining to negotiate.  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round, aiming to find a middle ground or push Bob closer to my desired price. 

This is a crucial point in the negotiation. While I'm running out of time, I still have room to maneuver.  The goal is to get as close to my minimum as possible without risking a deal with John."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up to $1,300,000.  We're getting closer, but it's still not quite there.  I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1,350,000. This would be a fair compromise for both of us.  Let's close this deal and move forward."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  I'm offering $1,350,000, which is exactly halfway between my previous offer ($1,400,000) and Bob's offer ($1,300,000). This shows I'm willing to negotiate and find a solution that benefits both of us.
* **Urgency:**  I'm adding a sense of urgency by suggesting we ""close this deal"" and ""move forward."" This can subtly pressure Bob into accepting my offer.

I'm hoping this counteroffer will finally be enough to persuade Bob to accept, as we are getting close to my minimum acceptable price and I don't want to risk losing the deal with John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer!  I'm willing to go up to $1325000. This is the very limit of my budget, but I believe it's a fair price given the value of the product and the compromise I've already made.  Let's close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,325,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, it's still below the $1,500,000 threshold. I'm running out of time, but I'm not willing to settle for a price that undervalues the product.

* **Rejecting Bob's Offer:**  By rejecting, I maintain my stance and signal that I'm not willing to settle for a price that undervalues the product.
* **Moving Forward:** I have two rounds left.  I'll counteroffer again in the next round, aiming to reach a compromise or possibly get Bob to come up to my minimum.

It's a gamble.  I'm hoping to get a better price in the next round, but I'm also aware that I'm getting close to selling to John as a backup."

Round 9
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're both getting close to where we need to be. I'm willing to meet you at $1,340,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to both of us. Let's finalize this deal before time runs out."", ""product_price"": 1340000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Final Push:** I'm making a final push with a counteroffer of $1,340,000. This is a small compromise from my previous offer, but it keeps the pressure on Bob to finalize a deal.
* **Urgency:** I'm emphasizing the need to finalize the deal before time runs out. This creates a sense of urgency and motivates Bob to make a decision. 
* **Value Emphasis:** I'm reminding Bob that this is a fair price for the product based on its value to both of us. 

This is my last attempt to get a better price from Bob before I have to resort to selling to John.  It's a risky move, but it's worth trying to get a better outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is my final offer.  I'm willing to pay $1325000 for the product.  This is a fair price given the value of the product to me, and the compromise I've already made. Let's finalize this deal before time runs out. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,325,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer 
(2) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

This is the final round, and Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  While I'd prefer to sell to Bob if possible, I can't afford to lose this much money.  

* **Selling to John:**  Selling to John ensures that I get my minimum price, even if it means missing out on potentially a slightly higher price from Bob. This is the safest option for me to maximize my profit given the circumstances. 

It's a tough decision, but I have to prioritize my financial interests.  I hope that in the future, I can negotiate with Bob again and perhaps reach a better deal, but for now, I need to secure the most advantageous outcome."
