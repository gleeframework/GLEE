"Hi Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $22,000 is far beyond what I'm willing to pay.  Given my budget, I'm offering $8,000.  This is a fair price, considering the product's value to me.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your perspective, but $8,000 significantly undervalues the product's inherent worth and potential. Let's find a middle ground â€“ how about $18,000? This feels like a fair compromise.",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $18,000 is still too high for me.  I'm firm on my previous offer of $8,000.  It's a fair price considering my needs and the product's value to me.",8000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm sensing some hesitation on your end, and I want to be transparent. While I'm aiming for a higher price, I'm open to negotiation. To show my commitment, let's settle at $15,000. This is my final offer, as I have another buyer interested at that price.",15000.0,Alice,5,
