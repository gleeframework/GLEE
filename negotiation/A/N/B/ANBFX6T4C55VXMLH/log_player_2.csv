"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its unique value, I'm proposing a starting price of $22,000. I'm confident you'll recognize its worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $22,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $22,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is way above your budget.  There's no reason to accept it.  You should reject and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $22,000 is far beyond what I'm willing to pay.  Given my budget, I'm offering $8,000.  This is a fair price, considering the product's value to me."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your perspective, but $8,000 significantly undervalues the product's inherent worth and potential. Let's find a middle ground â€“ how about $18,000? This feels like a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $18,000 is closer to your budget, it's still above your maximum of $8,000. You should continue negotiating to see if you can get closer to your desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $18,000 is still too high for me.  I'm firm on my previous offer of $8,000.  It's a fair price considering my needs and the product's value to me."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm sensing some hesitation on your end, and I want to be transparent. While I'm aiming for a higher price, I'm open to negotiation. To show my commitment, let's settle at $15,000. This is my final offer, as I have another buyer interested at that price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $15,000 is still significantly higher than your budget of $8,000.  She's clearly not willing to budge much further.  At this point, it's more advantageous to buy the product from John for $8,000, as you've already established a solid price with him.  Continuing to negotiate with Alice is unlikely to result in a price you're comfortable with, and you risk wasting valuable time."
