"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I think you'll really love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $120. It's a great deal, if I do say so myself!",120.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer Alice, but $120 is a bit steep for me. I'm happy to pay $90 for this product, considering its value to me. What do you think?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $120 might be a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $90. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $105. It's a fair price considering the value I think the product holds. What do you think?",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $105, but I'm still not quite there. How about $100?  That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to buy it now.",100.0,Bob,4,
