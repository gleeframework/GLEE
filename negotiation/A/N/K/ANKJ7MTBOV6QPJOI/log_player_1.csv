Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're willing to sell for $1,000,000 (your value) because you have a guaranteed buyer in John.
* **Bob's Valuation:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob.
* **The ""Zone of Possible Agreement"" (ZOPA):** Any price between $1,000,001 and $1,199,999 would theoretically benefit both of you.

**Strategy**

You want to maximize your profit while ensuring Bob accepts the deal. Offering a price too close to $1,200,000 leaves little room for you to gain, while a price too close to $1,000,000 might make Bob feel like he's getting an unfair deal. 

**Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exclusive opportunity to purchase the product. I know it holds significant value for you, and after careful consideration, I'm offering it at a price of $1,150,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I do have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Strong Opening:** You acknowledge the product's value to Bob, creating a collaborative tone.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $1,150,000 sits comfortably within the ZOPA, allowing both parties to benefit significantly.
* **Sense of Urgency:** Mentioning other interested parties (even if John is your only alternative) encourages Bob to act quickly. 

**Important Note:** Negotiation is dynamic. Bob might counter-offer. Be prepared to adjust your price slightly, but always keep your minimum in mind."
