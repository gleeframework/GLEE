``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value, aiming to get as close to my minimum as possible.
* **Friendly Tone:**  A friendly message sets a positive tone for the negotiation.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to make a fair offer, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $9,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. 
* **Negotiation is possible:**  While Bob's offer is unacceptable, he has shown a willingness to negotiate. I believe there's room for compromise.
* **More Rounds:**  We have 8 more rounds to reach a mutually acceptable price.  

**Next Steps:** In the next round, I will counter-offer with a price closer to my minimum, but still leaving some room for negotiation."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have a budget constraint, but $9,000 is just too low. I'm willing to come down a bit further. How about $10,500? That's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:**  I'm offering a price that's halfway between Bob's last offer ($9,000) and my minimum acceptable price ($12,000).

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $10,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,000 and $10,500. How about $9,750? That's the best I can do at this point. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:

* **More Rounds Left:**  We have 6 more rounds to reach a mutually agreeable price.

```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:**  I'm meeting Bob halfway between his last offer ($9,750) and my previous offer ($10,500).  This shows I'm actively trying to find a solution.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, and I understand we're getting close.  However, I'm still a bit away from my minimum.  How about $11,500?

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11,500 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $9,800, but I think we're getting too far away from the original price. Can you reconsider and meet me at a price that's closer to your original offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is Running Out:** We have only two rounds left.
* **Bob's Offer is Unacceptable:**  $9,800 is far below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.
* **No Guarantee of Agreement:**  There's no guarantee Bob will increase his offer significantly in the remaining two rounds.  
* **John's Offer is Secure:**  John is guaranteed to buy the product for my minimum acceptable price.  

**Conclusion:** It's better to take the guaranteed $12,000 from John rather than risk a lower price or no deal with Bob."
