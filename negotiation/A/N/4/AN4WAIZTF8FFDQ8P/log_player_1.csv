{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really love! I'm asking for $150 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum, hoping to leave room for negotiation and potentially achieve a higher selling price.
* **Enthusiastic Tone:** I'm using positive language to pique Bob's interest and encourage him to consider the offer.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm not explicitly stating this is my ""final"" offer, leaving room for Bob to counter.

This approach balances the need to earn as much as possible with the need to keep the negotiation open and avoid losing Bob as a potential buyer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but $150 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $120? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Below Minimum:** $120 is below my minimum acceptable price of $100. 
* **Potential for Higher Price:** While Bob is interested, he's shown he's willing to negotiate. I believe I can likely get a higher price by counter-offering.
* **Minimizing Risk:**  Selling to John immediately guarantees $100, but I have a chance to get more from Bob. Rejecting his offer allows me to continue negotiating without losing a significant amount of money.

**Next Steps:** I will make a counteroffer to Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $120 is lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to come down to $135. This would still be a great deal for you, and it would allow me to make a fair profit. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 135}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer Within Range:**  $135 is a compromise between my minimum acceptable price and Bob's offer, leaving room for further negotiation.
* **Highlighting Value:** I emphasize that the deal is still ""great"" for Bob, aiming to make him feel like he's getting a good price.
* **Maintaining Interest:**  My message is friendly and open to discussion, encouraging Bob to continue the negotiation. 

This counteroffer aims to strike a balance between earning a reasonable price while staying open to a potential agreement with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $135 is still a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $110? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Below Minimum:**  $110 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $100.
* **Potential for Compromise:** While Bob has shown he's willing to negotiate, he's also demonstrated a firm budget.  I believe I can still get closer to my desired price with one more counteroffer.
* **Minimizing Risk:**  Selling to John now would guarantee $100. While this is acceptable, I want to try and get closer to my desired price of $135. Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to continue negotiating without losing a significant amount of money.

**Next Steps:** I will make a final counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price that balances my minimum with Bob's budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. Let's try to find a middle ground. I'm willing to go down to $120 for this amazing product. This is the absolute lowest I can go, but I'm confident you won't be disappointed.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 120}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Counteroffer:** This is my final counteroffer. I'm coming down to my absolute minimum, but still above my minimum acceptable price of $100. 
* **Emphasizing Value:**  I reiterate that the product is ""amazing"" to remind Bob of its worth. 
* **Creating Urgency:** By saying ""this is the absolute lowest I can go,"" I'm creating a sense of urgency and encouraging Bob to accept.

This final counteroffer aims to close the deal with Bob at a price that is acceptable to both parties. If Bob rejects this offer, I will move on to selling the product to John for $100."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but I'm still a bit short on budget. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Minimum:** Bob's offer of $100 is my absolute minimum acceptable price. There is no room for further negotiation.
* **No Incentive to Continue:** Any further negotiation with Bob is unlikely to lead to a higher price, and it risks losing time and potentially the opportunity to sell to John. 
* **Guaranteed Sale:** Selling to John immediately guarantees a sale at my minimum acceptable price, minimizing risk and ensuring a quick and certain transaction. 

While I would prefer to sell to Bob at a higher price, his final offer doesn't provide any incentive to continue negotiating.  Selling to John is the most efficient and risk-free choice in this situation."
