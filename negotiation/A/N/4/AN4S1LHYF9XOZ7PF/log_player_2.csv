Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I recognize the potential value of the product, I believe your initial asking price is a little high. I'd be willing to start the negotiation at $800,000."", ""product_price"": 800000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand you're looking for a fair deal, however, $800,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to come down to $1,500,000. This feels like a reasonable compromise, considering its potential benefits. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me. However, $1,500,000 is still a bit too high for me. Could we settle on $1,000,000? This price reflects a serious offer while acknowledging the product's value."", ""product_price"": 1000000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. To be candid, $1,000,000 is cutting it close to my bottom line. I'm willing to consider $1,300,000 as my final offer. This represents a significant reduction on my part and reflects my desire to close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**  While Alice is coming down on her price, she's unlikely to go much lower than $1,300,000.  It's not worth the risk of further negotiation when you have a guaranteed option with John at $1,200,000."
