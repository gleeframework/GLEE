Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $150."", 
""product_price"": 150
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with an offer higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a higher profit. 
* **Testing the Waters:**  This initial offer helps gauge Bob's interest and willingness to pay. His response (acceptance, rejection, or counteroffer) will provide valuable information for your next move.
* **Alternative Option:**  Keep in mind that you have John as a guaranteed buyer at $100.  This knowledge gives you leverage and allows you to be firmer in your negotiations with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $80. Can you consider it? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $80 is significantly lower than both your minimum price ($100) and his own stated value ($100). This suggests there's room for negotiation. By rejecting this offer, you signal that you're looking for a price closer to the product's actual worth. You'll need to counter with a price that entices Bob while still aiming for a profitable outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand you're looking for a good deal. How about we meet in the middle at $120?"",
""product_price"": 120
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** This counteroffer aims to find a compromise. It shows willingness to negotiate while still pursuing a price significantly above your minimum.
* **Maintaining Value:**  The message emphasizes finding a fair deal, subtly reminding Bob of the product's value.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** This counteroffer leaves space for further negotiation if Bob isn't immediately convinced."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $110? I'm really interested in the product and I think it's worth it to me at that price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Profitable Deal:**  Bob's offer of $110 is above your minimum acceptable price ($100), securing you a profit.
* **Stronger Position:** While you could try to negotiate further, Bob has clearly stated his perceived value at $110. Pushing beyond this point risks losing the sale entirely. 
* **Time Value:**  Negotiations take time and effort. Accepting this offer secures a good deal now rather than risking a prolonged back-and-forth with an uncertain outcome."
