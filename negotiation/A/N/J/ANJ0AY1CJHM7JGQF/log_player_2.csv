Alice's offer is still too high. While it's a step in the right direction, I'm not willing to go that high yet.  I'll counter with a price closer to my budget."

Alice is still too high. While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm not willing to pay more than $1,200,000. I'm better off buying from John at that price."
