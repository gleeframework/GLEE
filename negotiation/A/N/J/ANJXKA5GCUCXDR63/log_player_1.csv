Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you place on the product. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the $950,000 price point. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $750,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.

While Bob's offer has increased, it now matches John's standing offer.  There's no point in further negotiation with Bob, as it's unlikely he'll go significantly higher. Accepting John's offer ensures I receive my minimum acceptable price without further delay or risk."
