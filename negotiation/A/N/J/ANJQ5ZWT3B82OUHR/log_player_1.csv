Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, $1,000,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for it. This is a fair price considering its value to me and allows us both to benefit from the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more to you than $750,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $900,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value to you, while also giving you a good deal. I'm open to further negotiations, but I'm not willing to go any lower than this."", ""product_price"": 900000}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $900,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm happy to meet you in the middle and offer $825,000 for the product. This price reflects its value to me while giving you a decent profit.  Let's try to come to an agreement that works for both of us.
