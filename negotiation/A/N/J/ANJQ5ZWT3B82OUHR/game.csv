"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,000,000. This is a great deal, considering its true value to you is $800,000. I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts.",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, $1,000,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for it. This is a fair price considering its value to me and allows us both to benefit from the deal.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more to you than $750,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $900,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value to you, while also giving you a good deal. I'm open to further negotiations, but I'm not willing to go any lower than this.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $900,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm happy to meet you in the middle and offer $825,000 for the product. This price reflects its value to me while giving you a decent profit.  Let's try to come to an agreement that works for both of us.",825000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $825,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $875,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's still a fair reflection of the product's value to you. Let's see if we can come to an agreement at this price.",875000.0,Alice,5,
