Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more to you than $750,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $900,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value to you, while also giving you a good deal. I'm open to further negotiations, but I'm not willing to go any lower than this.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $900,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm happy to meet you in the middle and offer $825,000 for the product. This price reflects its value to me while giving you a decent profit.  Let's try to come to an agreement that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 825000}

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $825,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $875,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's still a fair reflection of the product's value to you. Let's see if we can come to an agreement at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000

While you could keep negotiating, Alice's offer is getting closer to your maximum. At this point, it's more beneficial to accept the offer and avoid the risk of further negotiations. You're still getting a good deal, and you don't want to risk losing out to John."
