# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $9,500. I believe it would be highly valuable to you, and this price reflects its worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500.

(2) Reject Alice's offer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is better than buying from John.**  You're saving $500 by accepting Alice's offer. 
* **You're still getting the product for less than your maximum value.**  Even at $9,500, the product is worth it to you."
