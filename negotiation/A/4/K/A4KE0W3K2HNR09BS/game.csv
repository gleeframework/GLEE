"I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to get a better deal. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product. This price is still above your minimum value, and it gives us both a good deal. Let's work together to make this happen.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $1,100,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm thinking of a price of $1,300,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and my minimum value of $1,000,000.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your need to make a profit, Alice, and I'm willing to bridge the gap further.  $1,200,000 is a fair compromise, and it gives us both a good return on this deal.  It's closer to my budget, and it's still a healthy profit for you.  Let's get this done.",1200000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $1,200,000, but I'd like to propose a slight adjustment. Considering the value you place on the product, I'm willing to offer a slight discount. I'll meet you at $1,250,000, but I need to emphasize that this is a one-time offer. I'm confident that this is a fair price that benefits both parties.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
