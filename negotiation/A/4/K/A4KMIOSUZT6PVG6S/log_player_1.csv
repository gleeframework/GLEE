{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its potential value, I believe a price of $1,400,000 is fair. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's $1,500,000 valuation as possible. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $1,400,000 leaves space for potential negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Secure a Significant Gain:**  This price point ensures a profit of $200,000 over your minimum acceptable price.

By setting a high but justifiable price, you increase your chances of maximizing your profit while still making the deal attractive to Bob."
