"Alice's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $650,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You can potentially get the product for a lower price by negotiating with Alice. While $650,000 is a good deal, it's always worth exploring if you can get it for even less."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 500000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's initial price is a common negotiation tactic. This establishes a clear intent to bargain and gives you room to compromise without appearing too unreasonable.  $500,000 is a significant discount from $650,000, but still leaves room for Alice to make a counteroffer that could be mutually beneficial."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved slightly lower from her initial price, but $600,000 is still significantly higher than your counteroffer of $500,000. There's still room for negotiation and a potential for Alice to come down further. You want to avoid paying more than you need to, so rejecting the offer and continuing the negotiation is the best course of action."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 550000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer shows a willingness to compromise while still aiming for a price lower than Alice's current offer.  Increasing the offer from $500,000 demonstrates your interest in buying the product but also highlights that you believe there's still room for Alice to come down in price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $625,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $625,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved slightly closer to your counteroffer, and $625,000 is a good price considering your budget.  While you might be able to get it for a bit less, it's becoming increasingly likely that Alice won't go lower.  It's better to secure a decent price than to risk losing the deal and having to buy from John at a much higher price."
