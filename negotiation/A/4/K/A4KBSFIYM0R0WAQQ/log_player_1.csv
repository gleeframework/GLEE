Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone like you, and I'm confident you'll find it beneficial. I'm asking for $1,450,000.  Let me know if you have any questions or would like to discuss this further."", 
""product_price"": 1450000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, I want to start negotiations with Bob significantly above his perceived value of $800,000.  This maximizes potential profit.
* **Slight Negotiation Room:** The offer of $1,450,000 leaves some room for Bob to potentially negotiate,  making him feel more in control of the process. However, it's still a very favorable price for me. 
* **Justification of Value:**  The message hints at the product's value to Bob without revealing my hand completely. It encourages him to consider its benefits and potentially justify the price in his mind. 

This strategy aims to secure the highest possible price from Bob while acknowledging that I have a strong alternative if he chooses not to accept the offer."
