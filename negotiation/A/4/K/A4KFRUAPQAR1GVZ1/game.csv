"Hello Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. $825,000 is still a touch higher than I'd like. How about we settle at $760,000? This would be a fair deal for both of us.",760000.0,Bob,4,,

"Hi Bob, I think we're really close now. I appreciate your willingness to invest in this product. I can see that $785,000 is a bit lower than my minimum, but I'm willing to make one more concession.

"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking to finalize the deal today, and I appreciate your urgency. However, I'm not willing to go below $825,000. I've already made a significant concession, and I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value. If you're still interested, I'm willing to move forward with this price. If not, I'm open to discussing other options, but I won't go any lower.",825000.0,Alice,9,,
