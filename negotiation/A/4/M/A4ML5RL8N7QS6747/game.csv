"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment. I'm willing to start the conversation with a price of $900,000. What are your thoughts?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you starting the conversation. However, $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at the moment. I'm willing to pay $800,000 for the product. What do you think?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to make a deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $800,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so I'm counteroffering at $850,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value. What are your thoughts?",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price.  $850,000 is still a bit high for me, but I'm willing to go up to $825,000. This feels like a fair compromise, and I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement. What do you think?",825000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $825,000. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair price. I'm counteroffering at $835,000. I believe this is a reasonable price considering the product's value and the negotiations so far. What are your thoughts?",835000.0,Alice,5,
