"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment. I'm willing to start the conversation with a price of $900,000. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Alice's offer and see if I can get a better price.  $900,000 is a good starting point, but I want to see if I can negotiate lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you starting the conversation. However, $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at the moment. I'm willing to pay $800,000 for the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 800000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to make a deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $800,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so I'm counteroffering at $850,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Alice's offer again.  While $850,000 is closer to my target, I think I can still get a better price. I'm going to try one more counteroffer before I consider buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price.  $850,000 is still a bit high for me, but I'm willing to go up to $825,000. This feels like a fair compromise, and I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 825000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $825,000. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair price. I'm counteroffering at $835,000. I believe this is a reasonable price considering the product's value and the negotiations so far. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $835,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $835,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Alice's offer.  While I'd love to get the price down even further, $835,000 is a good price, and I don't want to risk losing the deal by continuing to negotiate.  It's a significant saving compared to buying from John."
