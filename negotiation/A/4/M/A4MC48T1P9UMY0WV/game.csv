"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for $10,000. This is a special opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset worth more than what you perceive its value to be, while also allowing me to maximize my earnings. Please let me know if this proposal suits your budget.",10000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you see in the product, $10,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it. This is a fair price considering my own valuation and your desire to sell. Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and would like to make a counteroffer. Given the value we both see in the product, I propose a price of $9,500. This allows us to meet somewhere in the middle, maximizing the value for both parties involved. I hope this proposal is acceptable to you.",9500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $9,500 is still a bit more than I can comfortably afford. Let's meet in the middle at $9,000. I believe this price reflects the value we both see in the product while allowing for a mutually beneficial transaction. ",9000.0,Bob,4,
