"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great fit for your needs. I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,000. This is a competitive price, considering the value it brings to your business.",9000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $9,000 is a bit high for me. Would you be willing to come down to $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $7,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $8,200. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings to your business.",8200.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. While $8,200 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch for my budget. Could you do $7,500? That would be a fair deal for both of us.",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $7,500 is still a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $8,100. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, as I still need to make a profit on this deal.",8100.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $8,100 is close, but I need to stay within my budget.  Would you consider $7,800? That would be my final offer.",7800.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $7,800 is your final offer, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I've already compromised a lot, and I need to make sure I get a fair price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $8,100 and $7,800. I can offer it to you for $7,950. This is my final offer.",7950.0,Alice,7,
