Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Bob's offer is still below my minimum, but closer. I'll reject and try to get closer to my target price."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm raising the price a bit from Bob's offer, but still leaving room for negotiation.  This is a compromise, hopefully bringing us closer to a deal."

Bob's offer is getting lower, and while I want to make a deal, I'm not comfortable going lower than my minimum.  I'd rather sell to John and get my desired price."
