"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm starting with a high price of $1,000,000. This is ambitious, but it gives me room to negotiate and hopefully allows me to earn a significant profit. 

I'll be watching Bob's reaction closely and adjusting my strategy based on his response and the number of rounds remaining."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $800,000 is my minimum, I'm not going to settle for that right away. I have 8 rounds left and I want to see if I can get closer to my ideal price. 

I'll send a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm going to counter with $900,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still a substantial profit. 

I'm hoping that Bob sees the value of the product and is willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's getting closer to my minimum, I still have 6 rounds left and I think I can get a better price. I'll counter with a slightly higher offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

I'm going to counter with $850,000. This is a significant concession from my previous offer but still above my minimum and leaves room for further negotiation. 

I'm hoping that Bob recognizes the value of the product and the fact that I'm willing to negotiate, and we can reach a deal in the next few rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $725,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's getting closer to my minimum, I still have 4 rounds left and I think I can get a better price. I'll counter with a slightly higher offer in the next round. 

At this point, I am starting to consider selling to John. I have only four rounds left, and the negotiations seem to be stalling. If Bob doesn't come up with a better offer soon, I might need to take the guaranteed $800,000 from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000}
```

I'm going to counter with $800,000. This is my absolute minimum, and I'm hoping that Bob will finally accept. We're running out of time, and selling to John for the same price is becoming increasingly tempting."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell to John. With only two rounds left, Bob is clearly unwilling to meet my minimum price. While I'd prefer to get a bit more, it's not worth risking a deal entirely. 

Selling to John guarantees me my minimum value, and I can always try to find another buyer later."
