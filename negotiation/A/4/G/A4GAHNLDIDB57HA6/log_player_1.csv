Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **My minimum:** I value the product at $15,000, so I won't sell it for less.
* **Bob's value:**  Bob values the product at $10,000. 
* **Negotiation room:** There's a $5,000 gap between our values. I'm starting with a price that leaves room for negotiation.  
* **John's offer:**  Knowing I have a backup offer of $15,000 from John gives me confidence to push for a higher price.

I'm hoping Bob will see the value in the product and be willing to pay a price closer to my minimum.  We'll see if he accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer:** Bob's offer of $12,000 is still below my minimum value of $15,000.
* **Potential for a better deal:**  I believe there's still room for negotiation, considering Bob rejected my initial offer, which means he sees some value in the product beyond his $10,000 valuation.
* **John's offer:** I have a guaranteed $15,000 offer from John, so I'm not desperate to sell to Bob at a lower price.

I'll counteroffer Bob with a price closer to my minimum, hoping to secure a deal closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Balancing Act:** I'm aiming for a price that's a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. 
* **Negotiation Progress:** Bob's counteroffer shows he's willing to move closer to my desired price. This encourages me to meet him halfway.
* **Still Above Minimum:** $13,500 is still above my minimum value, allowing for some profit while potentially securing a deal with Bob. 
* **Maintaining Leverage:** I'm not yet prepared to drop to $12,000, as I still have John's offer as a backup.

I'm hoping this counteroffer will be attractive enough for Bob while leaving space for further negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Negotiation Stalemate:** Bob's offer of $12,500 is only $500 more than his previous offer, indicating he might not be willing to move much higher.
* **Value Gap:**  There's still a significant gap between my minimum value ($15,000) and his offer. 
* **Time Factor:** Continuing the negotiation with Bob might take more time and energy, potentially leading to a lower final price or a protracted process.
* **Guaranteed Profit:** Selling to John ensures I receive my desired minimum price and secure a quick and guaranteed sale.

While I'd ideally like to get closer to my initial asking price, the risk of further negotiation with Bob outweighs the potential reward. Selling to John guarantees a profit and allows me to move on to other opportunities."
