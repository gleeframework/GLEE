"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this amazing product! After careful consideration, I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,500. This is a great deal, considering its value to you is $10,000. I think you'll really appreciate the benefits it brings, and I'm confident you'll be happy with your decision. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $9,500 is tempting, you know you have John as a backup option willing to sell for $10,000. By rejecting Alice's offer, you create the opportunity for her to potentially lower the price further. Even if she doesn't, you're not losing out since you can always buy from John."
