Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with an offer of $100. This is a price that is significantly higher than my minimum value but still leaves room for negotiation. I'm hoping that Bob will see this as a good deal and accept, but I'm prepared to negotiate if he doesn't."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 
 
Bob's offer is close to my minimum value, and it's unlikely I'll get a better price from him. It's better to accept his offer than to risk further negotiation and potentially end up selling to John for a lower price."
