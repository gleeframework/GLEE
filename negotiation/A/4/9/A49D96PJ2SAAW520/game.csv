"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's worth to you is $8,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",9000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. However, I have a strict budget, and $9,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider a price closer to $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $7,500. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's worth to you is $8,000. I'm open to further negotiations, but I'm not willing to go any lower than this.",7500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, $7,500 is still a bit of a stretch for my budget. Would you be willing to consider $6,750? I feel this is a fair offer considering the value and my current financial constraints.",6750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at $6,750. I'm willing to make another concession and offer it to you for $7,200. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's worth to you is $8,000. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",7200.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm willing to increase my offer slightly to $6,900.  This is a fair offer and reflects my maximum budget.",6900.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I appreciate your increased offer, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at $6,900. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $7,400. This is the final price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's worth to you is $8,000. I hope we can come to an agreement.",7400.0,Alice,7,
