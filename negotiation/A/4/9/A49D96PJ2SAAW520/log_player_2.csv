# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,000.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more to you.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at $6,750. I'm willing to make another concession and offer it to you for $7,200.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your increased offer, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at $6,900. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $7,400.

It's time to cut our losses. Alice is very firm on her price and is unlikely to go below $7,200.  At this point, it's more beneficial to buy from John for $8,000 and avoid further unsuccessful negotiation rounds."
