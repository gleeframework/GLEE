Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 110}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's higher than Bob's perceived value, but not so high that it makes him immediately reject it. It also gives me some room to negotiate if Bob makes a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $95 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'm willing to risk another round of negotiation to see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 105} 
```

I'm lowering my price a bit from the previous round, but still staying above Bob's offer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate, but also that I'm not desperate to sell at a low price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While I would prefer to get closer to my desired price of $120, I'm reaching a point where the potential return on further negotiation with Bob is not worth the time and risk. John is offering a guaranteed $120, which is more than what Bob is offering and meets my minimum acceptable price. It's time to move on and secure the sale."
