"Hey Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $180 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend.  How about $140?  I'm serious about buying this, and that's my top limit.",140.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $140. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you in the middle and offer it to you for $160. This is my best price, and I'm confident you'll love the product. What do you think?",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $160 is still a bit too high for me. I'm really interested in this product, but I can only go up to $150. Let's meet in the middle.  If you're not willing to go that low, I'm going to have to look elsewhere.",150.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $150. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $155. This is as low as I can go, and I'm confident you'll love the product. What do you think?",155.0,Alice,5,
