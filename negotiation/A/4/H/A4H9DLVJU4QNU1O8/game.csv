,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7500 is unfortunately a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and I go down to $8500? It's still a great deal for you considering the value of this product.",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're looking for a fair price, but I'm still not comfortable with $8500. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so I'll go up to $7250. Can you consider that?",7250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $7250 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down a little further and meet you at $8000. This would be a fair price for both of us, and I believe it reflects the true value of the product.",8000.0,Alice,5,
