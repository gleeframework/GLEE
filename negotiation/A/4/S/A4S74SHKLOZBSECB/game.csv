"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested in the product, but $95 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $70?",70.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $70 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to come down to $85.  This is still above my minimum, and I think it's a fair price for both of us.  What do you think?",85.0,Alice,3,

"I understand, Alice.  $85 is closer, but I'm trying to stick to a tight budget.  How about $75?",75.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm really trying to work with you here, but $75 is still just a bit too low for me.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $80?  I think this would be a fair deal for both of us.  What do you say?",80.0,Alice,5,
