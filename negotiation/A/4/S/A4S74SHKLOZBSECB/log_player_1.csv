{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really love it. I'm willing to let it go for $95.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 95}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than Bob's perceived value:**  Bob values the product at $80, so $95 gives him some room to negotiate.
* **It's lower than your minimum:**  $95 is still above your $100 minimum, so you're not losing money. 

By starting at $95, you can gauge Bob's interest and potentially negotiate a price that is closer to your desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested in the product, but $95 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $70? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly lower than your minimum value of $100. While it's tempting to accept his offer, it's not in your best interest to sell the product for less than your minimum.  You have two better options: 

1. **Reject and counteroffer:**  You can counter with a price that is still above your minimum but closer to Bob's offer. This gives you a chance to potentially close the deal with Bob.
2. **Sell to John:**  If you're not confident you can reach a mutually beneficial agreement with Bob, you can always sell to John for your desired $100."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $70 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to come down to $85.  This is still above my minimum, and I think it's a fair price for both of us.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand, Alice.  $85 is closer, but I'm trying to stick to a tight budget.  How about $75? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $75 is still below your minimum value of $100. While you're getting closer, it's not worth it to sell the product below your minimum.  You have two better options:

1. **Reject and counteroffer:** You can try one more counteroffer, perhaps a price slightly higher than Bob's offer, to see if you can bridge the gap.
2. **Sell to John:** If you feel like negotiations are getting nowhere, selling to John for $100 ensures you get your minimum value."

{""message"": ""Bob, I'm really trying to work with you here, but $75 is still just a bit too low for me.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $80?  I think this would be a fair deal for both of us.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 80}
