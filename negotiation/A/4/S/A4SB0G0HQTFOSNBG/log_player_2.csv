"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

It's always worth exploring options before committing to the first offer.  Rejecting Alice's offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price.  There's a chance Alice might be willing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob starts by making a significant counteroffer, aiming for a 25% discount. This demonstrates his seriousness in negotiating while also leaving room for further compromise. It's a strong starting point for a negotiation,  testing Alice's willingness to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is a better offer than Alice's initial $1,000,000, Bob still has room to negotiate.  He can likely get a lower price, especially since Alice has already shown a willingness to compromise. Rejecting this offer keeps the negotiation going and potentially leads to a better outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a middle ground.  By offering $800,000, he's showing a willingness to meet Alice halfway while still pushing for a lower price. This counteroffer could be appealing to Alice, as it's closer to her previous offer and demonstrates Bob's seriousness in reaching an agreement."
