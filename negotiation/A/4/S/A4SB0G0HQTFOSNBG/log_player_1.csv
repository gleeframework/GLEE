"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

I'm starting high, at $1,000,000. This is a bold move, but I want to see if Bob is seriously interested and if he's willing to pay a premium. If he rejects, I'll have a better understanding of his price range and can adjust accordingly in subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $750,000 is better than my minimum, I believe I can get closer to my desired price.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to push for a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

I'm going to counter with $900,000.  This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still a significant amount. I'm hoping Bob will see the value in my product and be willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob has offered my minimum price, and I don't want to risk losing the deal by continuing to negotiate.  I'll accept his offer and sell the product for $800,000."
