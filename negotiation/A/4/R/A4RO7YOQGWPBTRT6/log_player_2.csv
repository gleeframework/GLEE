Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand you're looking to pay a bit less, but I'm still confident the product's value to you is higher. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1100000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's true value to you. What do you think?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is a better price than her initial offer, you're still looking to save as much money as possible. It's worth another counteroffer to see if you can push for a lower price before considering John's offer."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make another adjustment. However, I'm not willing to go much lower than this.

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $1,080,000, which is a good price considering your budget.  It's a significant saving compared to John's offer of $1,500,000.  While you could try another counteroffer, there's a risk Alice could walk away or come back with a higher price. It's likely that this is the best deal you'll get without taking on more risk."
