"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000.  It's in great condition and worth a lot to the right person.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

You're looking to save as much as possible, and $14,000 is still more than you'd like to pay.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm really interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $13,000 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 13000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping to get closer to my asking price. How about $13,500?  It's a fair compromise, and I think you'll find the product is well worth it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

While you could try to negotiate further, Alice is getting closer to your desired price. Accepting the offer at $13,500 saves you $1,500 compared to buying from John.  It's a good compromise."
