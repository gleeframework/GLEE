Round 3

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm trying to be flexible here.  How about we split the difference again and settle on $110?  This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** While Alice is showing some flexibility, her ""final offer"" of $110 is still above your maximum budget and what John is consistently offering.  It's unlikely she'll come down further, and you risk her sticking to this price in future rounds. It's time to cut your losses and secure the product from John at the price you know you can get."
