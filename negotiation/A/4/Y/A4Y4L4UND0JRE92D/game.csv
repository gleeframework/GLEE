"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking of making a counteroffer of $10,800. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to see if we can get closer to my budget. Let me know what you think!",10800.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $10,800 is still a bit below what I'm hoping to get. How about we split the difference and settle on $11,150?  This would give you a good price and allow me to get closer to my desired price. Let's try to close this deal, I think it's a win-win for both of us!",11150.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your revised offer, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'll make a counteroffer of $11,000. I think this is a fair price for both of us, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement. Let me know what you think!",11000.0,Bob,4,
