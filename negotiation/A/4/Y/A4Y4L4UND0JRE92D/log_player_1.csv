# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking of making a counteroffer of $10,800. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to see if we can get closer to my budget. Let me know what you think!

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price. I'm going to counter with a slightly lower price to see if we can meet in the middle."
