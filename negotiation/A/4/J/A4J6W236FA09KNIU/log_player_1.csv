Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product for $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price."", 
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($100) as possible while still exceeding your minimum selling price ($120).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $119 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially counter-offer, while still securing a profit for you. 
* **Alternative Buyer:**  Knowing you have a guaranteed sale at $120 with John provides leverage. You're not desperate to sell to Bob below your minimum.

**Important Note:**  There's a chance Bob might reject $119.  However, this strategy prioritizes maximizing potential profit over guaranteeing a sale to Bob."
