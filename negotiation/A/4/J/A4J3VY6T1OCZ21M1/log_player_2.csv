"Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You should reject the offer.  While $10,000 is better than Alice's initial asking price, you can potentially get a better deal by counteroffering. You have a clear goal of $8,000, and you know you can secure that price from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
``` 

This counteroffer starts the negotiation by offering a price significantly lower than Alice's offer, but still above your target price.  This allows for potential negotiation without immediately pushing Alice to reject the offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer of $9,500 is within your budget and closer to your target price of $8,000.  While you could continue negotiating, there's no guarantee you'll get a better deal, and you risk losing the product entirely if Alice decides to sell to someone else."
