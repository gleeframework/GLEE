"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $18,000.  It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $18,000 is way over Bob's budget and there are more rounds to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, $18,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in your product, but my budget is closer to $10,000. Would you be willing to consider a price closer to that? "", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $10,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $13,000?  That's still a great deal for you considering the value of this product.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $13,000 is closer to his budget, there's still room for negotiation and potentially a better deal.  He should see if he can get the price down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for coming down a bit.  I'm still really interested in your product, but $13,000 is still a bit more than I can afford right now.  Would you be willing to consider $11,000?  That would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to sell the product for $12,000.  This is a fair price for both of us and will allow you to get the valuable product you need.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  While $12,000 is still a bit higher than his ideal price, it's a fair compromise considering the value of the product and the fact that Alice has already lowered her price significantly.  It's unlikely that he'll be able to get a better deal with Alice, and it's a much better price than buying from John."
