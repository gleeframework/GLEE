"Hi Alice, $18,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in your product, but my budget is closer to $10,000. Would you be willing to consider a price closer to that? ",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $10,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $13,000?  That's still a great deal for you considering the value of this product. ",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thanks for coming down a bit.  I'm still really interested in your product, but $13,000 is still a bit more than I can afford right now.  Would you be willing to consider $11,000?  That would be a fair price for both of us.",11000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to sell the product for $12,000.  This is a fair price for both of us and will allow you to get the valuable product you need.  What do you say?",12000.0,Alice,5,
