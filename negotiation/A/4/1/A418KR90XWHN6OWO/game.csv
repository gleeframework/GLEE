"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $6,000 for it.  What do you think?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest.  While I understand that's your budget, $6,000 is significantly less than what I can accept. This product is really valuable, and to make it worth my while, I would need something closer to $11,000. Would that work for you?",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $11,000 is still a bit too steep for me.  Would you be willing to meet in the middle somewhere around $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,4,
