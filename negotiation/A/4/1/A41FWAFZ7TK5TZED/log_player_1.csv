Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's a significant discount from my minimum price, but still gives me a decent profit. It's also a good starting point for negotiation. I'm hoping to get closer to my ideal price of $12,000. If Bob rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and see if it's worth continuing the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate your product, $10,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $8,500, which is still a great price considering the product's value to me. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum price of $12,000, and even lower than my initial offer of $10,000. Accepting it would result in a significant loss. I'm not willing to sell the product for such a low price. I'll counter-offer to see if we can reach a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $8,500 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further. How about $9,500? That's still a great deal for you, and it gives me a fair price for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $9,500 is still a bit too high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $9,000? This price allows us both to get a fair deal. What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This is a difficult choice, but ultimately, $9,000 is still better than the $8,500 Bob offered before. While it's not my ideal price, it's a good compromise that gets me closer to my minimum of $12,000. It also avoids the risk of further negotiation with Bob, which might result in an even lower price. I don't want to risk losing this sale to John, so accepting this offer seems like the best option."
