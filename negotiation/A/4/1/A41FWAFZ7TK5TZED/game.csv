"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate your product, $10,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $8,500, which is still a great price considering the product's value to me. Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $8,500 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further. How about $9,500? That's still a great deal for you, and it gives me a fair price for the product. Let me know what you think.",9500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $9,500 is still a bit too high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $9,000? This price allows us both to get a fair deal. What do you say?",9000.0,Bob,4,
