{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. This is a fair price, considering your stated value and my budget. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1200000 is unfortunately too far below what I need to make this worthwhile.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to lower my price to $1300000. It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident this will be a great deal for both of us.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your flexibility and persistence. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but $1250000 is still a bit too low for me. Let's try $1275000. This is a good compromise, and I'm confident we can both be happy with this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,275,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,275,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting closer to your desired price range, but it's still above your target. You're still within your budget and have a few more rounds to try and negotiate further. Since John is still an option for $1,500,000, you can take a calculated risk and try to push for a lower price."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down in price. However, $1,275,000 is still a bit too high. Let's try $1,260,000. This is a fair compromise, and it's the most I can offer at this point.  Let's aim for a win-win scenario."", ""product_price"": 1260000}

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1260000 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's meet in the middle once more. I'm willing to lower my price to $1265000.  This is a small adjustment, and I'm confident it will be a fair and agreeable compromise for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,265,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,265,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,265,000 is within your budget, and you're running out of rounds.  While you could continue negotiating, there's a risk that Alice will become unwilling to budge further or that you might miss out on the deal altogether. Accepting the offer ensures you get the product at a price that's favorable to you, and it's still significantly less than what you'd pay to John."
