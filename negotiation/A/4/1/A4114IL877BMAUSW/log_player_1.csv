This offer is aggressive, but it's important to start high and see if we can get Bob to negotiate.  I'm keeping John in mind as a backup, so I'm not afraid to walk away if Bob won't meet my price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product, but I am only willing to pay up to $10,000 for it. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is way too low.  While I'm tempted to take the $10,000,  it's significantly less than what I know the product is worth. I'll try to negotiate a better price with Bob, but I'm not afraid to walk away and sell to John if necessary."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $10,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $12,500, which is still a great deal for you.  Let's find a middle ground. "", ""product_price"": 12500}
``` 
I'm willing to compromise a bit, but I'm not going to give away the product for a huge loss. I'm hoping that this counteroffer is attractive enough for Bob to accept, but I'm still prepared to walk away if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I still believe $10,000 is a fair price for the product. I would like to stick to my original offer. Thank you for considering my perspective. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

It seems like Bob is unwilling to budge from his $10,000 offer. While I'm open to negotiation, I'm not willing to sell this product for a significant loss. I've already offered a substantial discount from my asking price.  To ensure I get a fair price, I'm going to sell the product to John for $15,000."
