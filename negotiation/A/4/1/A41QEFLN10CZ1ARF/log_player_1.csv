Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $100, which is above my minimum value of $80. This gives me some room to negotiate and hopefully earn more. I've also included a friendly message to encourage Bob to accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $60. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $60 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than my minimum value of $80. I'm going to try to get closer to my desired price with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $60 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price. How about we split the difference and go with $80?  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 80}
```

I'm offering a counteroffer of $80, which is my minimum value.  I've explained to Bob that $60 is too low but I'm willing to be flexible.  This should hopefully incentivize him to accept the offer."
