Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm asking for $18,000.  It's a unique item, and I'm confident it will meet your needs. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 18000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price significantly higher than my minimum ($12,000) and Bob's perceived value. This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to potentially secure a much higher profit.
* **Justification:**  The message implies the product's value without explicitly stating Bob is getting a ""bad deal."" This encourages him to consider the offer seriously.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone is open for discussion, signaling I'm willing to negotiate if Bob pushes back.

**Worst Case Scenario:** Bob rejects the offer, and I sell to John for $12,000, still meeting my minimum."
