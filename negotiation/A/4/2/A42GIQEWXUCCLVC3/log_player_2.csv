"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I have a unique opportunity for you, Bob. I'm willing to sell this exclusive product to you for $9,500. It's a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a deal like this anywhere else. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer:** $9,500
* **Your maximum value:** $10,000
* **John's offer:** $10,000
