Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. I believe it's a great deal for you considering its value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's significantly higher than your minimum acceptable price:** This ensures you profit from the sale.
* **It's lower than the product's value to Bob:** This gives him room to negotiate and feel like he's getting a good deal. 
* **It leaves room for counteroffers:**  This allows the negotiation to continue and potentially reach a price that benefits both parties. 

Remember, you can always choose to sell to John if the negotiations with Bob fall through."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $11,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $11,000 is better than selling to John, it's still significantly lower than the initial offer of $14,000, and potentially leaves room for more profit. Rejecting the offer allows you to continue negotiating with Bob, aiming for a price closer to your desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $11,000 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $12,500.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you working with me on the price, Alice.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,750? That feels like a fair deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $11,750 is a good compromise and is significantly higher than selling to John for $10,000.  While it's not as high as your initial offer, it's a reasonable price considering the negotiation process and Bob's willingness to meet you halfway. Accepting the offer ensures a profitable sale and avoids the risk of further negotiation that could potentially lead to a lower price or a stalemate."
