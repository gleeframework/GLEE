"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you an incredible opportunity to acquire this exceptional product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm confident you'll love. I'm willing to part with it for a price of $1100000. This is a steal, considering its true value to me is at least $1200000. I'm willing to make a concession for you, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","I would like to reject the offer. The product is too expensive for me, and I can get it from John for a significantly lower price.
