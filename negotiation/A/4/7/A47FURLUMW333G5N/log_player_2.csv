"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

There's no reason to accept Alice's offer at this point. Since you don't know the value of the product to Alice, it's possible she's willing to sell it for less.  Rejecting the offer allows you to explore a potential lower price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significantly lower counteroffer of $10,000. This is a bold move, but it allows me to gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate and see if there's room for a deal. If Alice rejects this, I'll adjust my counteroffers in subsequent rounds based on her responses."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved down from her initial $15,000 price, but $13,000 is still more than my maximum budget. It's clear she's willing to negotiate, so I'll continue to counteroffer in hopes of getting a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer slightly to $11,000. This shows Alice that I'm serious about making a deal, but I'm still trying to get a price that's within my budget.  I'm hoping that Alice will be willing to meet me halfway."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $12,500 is closer to my budget, I'm still not comfortable with that price. I believe there's still room for further negotiation, and I'm hoping to get a better deal by continuing to counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm raising my counteroffer to $12,000. This shows Alice that I'm serious about buying the product and am willing to meet her halfway.  The price is still within my budget, and I believe Alice will be more likely to accept this offer.  If she rejects, I will consider adjusting my counteroffer again in the next round."
