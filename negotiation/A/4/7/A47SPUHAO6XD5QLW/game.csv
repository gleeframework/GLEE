"Hi Bob, I understand that you're looking to stay within your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway.

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a compromise, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $890000. I've already compromised significantly, and I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer, and I'm offering you a price of $898000.
