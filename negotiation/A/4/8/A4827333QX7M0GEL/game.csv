"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I agree the product has potential, that price point is a little too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $1,000,000 for it. ",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate you countering.  That said, $1,000,000 is a significant step down from my initial offer.  This product offers immense value, and I believe a price of $1,200,000 is more reflective of that. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand the value proposition, but I need to stick to my budget on this. How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000? ",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, you're clearly recognizing the value this product offers. Let's find a compromise. How about $1,150,000? I'm confident this would be a win-win.",1150000.0,Alice,5,
