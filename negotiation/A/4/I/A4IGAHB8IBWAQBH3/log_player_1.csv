"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm starting high, at $10,000. This is a bold move, but it allows for room to negotiate. It also lets Bob know that I value the product highly.  We'll see if he bites!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $8,000 is my minimum, I'm not willing to settle just yet. I'll see if I can push for a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

I'm going to counter with $9,000. This is a compromise, but still leaves some room for negotiation. I'm hoping that Bob is willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer of $8,500. It's a good deal for both of us, and it's more than my minimum asking price. I'm not willing to risk another round and potentially lose out on this sale."
