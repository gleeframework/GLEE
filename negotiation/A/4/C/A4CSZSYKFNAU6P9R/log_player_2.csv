Alice is coming down in price, which is a good sign. However, I still think I can get it for less than $115. I'll make another counteroffer in the next round to see if I can close the gap."

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad you're interested in the product, Bob. I can see you're trying to stretch your budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $110 and $120, which is $115. However, I can do one better. I'll offer it to you for $112.50. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $112.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $112.5

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice has come down significantly from her initial price and I'm getting close to my budget limit.  At this point, $112.50 is a good deal, and I don't want to risk losing out on the product altogether by continuing to bargain."
