Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $1,200,000 is a bit steep for you. However, $650,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to stretch your budget, but $775,000 is still not enough for me to consider selling. I'm starting to think that you're not serious about buying the product at a fair price. I'm willing to give you one last chance, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to sell it to you for $950,000, but that's as low as I can go. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

Alice's latest offer is a step in the wrong direction and signals she's not genuinely negotiating towards a realistic price. It's clear she's trying to push you close to your limit, even if it means losing the sale.  You're better off securing a guaranteed good deal with John at $800,000."
