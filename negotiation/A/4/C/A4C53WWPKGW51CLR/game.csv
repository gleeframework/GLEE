"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think you'll find it's a great opportunity. I'm willing to start the negotiation with an offer of $1,200,000.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but the price is too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $650,000.",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $1,200,000 is a bit steep for you. However, $650,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $900,000 is still a bit outside my budget. I can offer $720,000.  Let me know if that works for you.",720000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $720,000 is still not enough for me to consider selling. I'm willing to meet you at $850,000, but that's as low as I can go. I'm starting to think that this might not be the right product for you, but I'm willing to give you one more chance.",850000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're right that we're getting close. I'm willing to stretch my budget a bit, but $850,000 is still a bit too high.  How about $775,000? That's a significant increase from my last offer and shows how serious I am about this purchase.",775000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to stretch your budget, but $775,000 is still not enough for me to consider selling. I'm starting to think that you're not serious about buying the product at a fair price. I'm willing to give you one last chance, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to sell it to you for $950,000, but that's as low as I can go. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",950000.0,Alice,7,
