Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective on the price, but $8,000 is significantly below its true value.  To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $19,000. This feels like a fair offer considering the product's potential.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us. How about we meet halfway at $14,250? That's a significant compromise on my end, reflecting my desire to make this deal happen.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but comparing my product solely to John's offer doesn't reflect the additional value and benefits mine provides. To move this forward, I can come down to $13,000.  This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is holding firm at a price that's significantly higher than your alternative option. She's stated this is her final offer, and while she might be bluffing, it's too risky to continue. You've already managed to get her down considerably, but not enough to justify the extra cost compared to John's guaranteed offer. Buying from John ensures you get the product within your budget and avoids the risk of the negotiation failing."
