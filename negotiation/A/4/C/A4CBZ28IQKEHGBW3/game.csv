"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it.

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value you see in this product, $1,200,000 is significantly above my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in the product.  Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $850,000. I understand that it's above your budget, but I'm not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you a price of $1,100,000. This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's value to you. Let me know what you think.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,100,000 is still beyond my budget.  I'm prepared to offer $900,000 for the product. This is a fair price, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $900,000 is still a bit above your budget, but I'm not willing to sell the product at a significantly lower price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you a price of $975,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to me. Let me know if this is something you're interested in.",975000.0,Alice,5,
