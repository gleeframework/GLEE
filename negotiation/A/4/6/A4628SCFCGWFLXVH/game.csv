"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $20,000 is a bit out of my price range.  Would you consider $12,000?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but $12,000 is quite a bit below its true value. Could you do $17,000? This feels like a fair compromise.",17000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you working on this with me, Bob.  How about we split the difference and settle at $15,500? This would be a fair deal for both of us.",15500.0,Alice,5,
