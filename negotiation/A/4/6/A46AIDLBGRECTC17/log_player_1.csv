"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $100. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a price of $100, which is higher than Bob's perceived value of $80 but still leaves room for negotiation.  This gives me a good starting point and allows for potential profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate it, but I can only pay up to $85 for the product. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $85 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, hoping to reach a more favorable price.  I'm not ready to sell to John yet, as I have time and the potential to get closer to my desired price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $95. This is a good price for both of us, and I believe it's a fair compromise. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 95} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm counteroffering with $95. This is still a significant profit for me, as it's above my minimum acceptable price of $120. It's also a compromise, showing Bob that I'm willing to negotiate and find a middle ground."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate it. I'd like to counter with $90 for the product. Let me know if this is acceptable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $90 is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $120.  I'm not ready to sell to John yet, but I will continue negotiating with Bob. I believe there is still room for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $90 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $92.50. This would be a great deal for both of us.  Let's close this deal, what do you say?"", ""product_price"": 92.5} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm again counteroffering, this time with $92.50. This is a slight increase from Bob's last offer, but it shows I'm still flexible and willing to compromise. I'm also emphasizing the win-win nature of the deal to further encourage Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to counter with $90 again. This feels like a fair price for both of us. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

We are now in round 6 and Bob is stuck at $90.  This is a good deal for him, but it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $120. I've already made a significant concession by going down from $100 to $92.50.  It's unlikely that Bob will increase his offer further, and it's becoming increasingly risky to continue negotiating. It's time to cut my losses and sell to John for $120. This guarantees my minimum profit and avoids further rounds of potentially unproductive negotiation."
