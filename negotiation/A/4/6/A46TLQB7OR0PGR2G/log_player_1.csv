Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product. It's a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. I believe it's worth $1,200,000 to you, given its value. Let's start with a price of $1,100,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1100000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $900000 is a more reasonable price considering its value to me. I'm willing to pay $900000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's tempting to accept and secure a sale,  $900,000 is below my minimum threshold. I'm confident I can negotiate a better deal with Bob, and I'm willing to risk it."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. However, $900,000 doesn't reflect the true value of this product. Let's find a compromise. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This price is fair to both of us and allows us to finalize the deal."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $900000 is my maximum budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $950000. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $950,000 is closer to my desired price, I'm still hesitant to settle for a figure below $1 million. There are only six rounds left, and I believe I can still reach a more favorable outcome with Bob or secure the $1 million from John if necessary."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $950,000 still feels a bit low considering the product's value.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $975,000.  It's a fair price for both of us, and it would allow us to finalize this transaction."" , ""product_price"": 975000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above $900000. I'm willing to meet you at $960000. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $960,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $960,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While Bob's offer of $960,000 is tempting, with only 4 rounds remaining, I'm not confident I can secure a better price from him. It's risky to continue negotiating, as time is running out, and I could end up with less than $1 million. To guarantee a secure and profitable sale, I will sell the product to John for $1,000,000."
