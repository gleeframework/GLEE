Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product, which I know would be very valuable to you. I'm willing to part with it for $12,000."", 
""product_price"": 12000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Bob is willing to pay $15,000, you want to get as close to that as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $12,000 leaves room for Bob to potentially negotiate down, while still ensuring a significant profit for you. 
* **Avoid Appearing Greedy:**  While you could start higher, aiming for the maximum might make Bob walk away without countering. A price of $12,000 positions the offer as a potential win-win.
* **Backup Option:** You have a guaranteed buyer at $8,000, so there's limited risk in aiming high with Bob."
