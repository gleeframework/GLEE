"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1200000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $900000 for this product, given its value to me.  I'm confident this is a fair price considering the potential benefits. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer.  While $900000 is a fair price, it's just slightly below my minimum. I'm willing to come down to $1050000. This represents a significant concession on my part, but it's also a price that reflects the product's value.  Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1050000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $950000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer.  This represents a compromise on my part, and I believe it reflects the value of the product. Let's try to find a mutually agreeable solution.",950000.0,Bob,4,
