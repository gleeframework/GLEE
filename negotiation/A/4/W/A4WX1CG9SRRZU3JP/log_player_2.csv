"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm asking for $140 for it. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

``` 
Let's try to negotiate a better price with Alice first. $140 is still too close to my maximum budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm interested in the product, but $140 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $100?"",
""product_price"": 100
}
``` 

This counter-offer is a significant reduction from Alice's asking price, which might grab her attention. However, it's still within a reasonable negotiation range, and leaves room to potentially meet in the middle if she rejects it."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob,  I appreciate your interest!  $100 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $125. This would still give me some profit, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice has met me closer to my budget, and while it's slightly more than John's offer, it's worth it to avoid the risk of further negotiation."
