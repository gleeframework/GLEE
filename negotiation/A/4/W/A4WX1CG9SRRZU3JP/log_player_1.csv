{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm asking for $140 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's higher than Bob's perceived value, but not so high that it's immediately rejected. It leaves room for negotiation and gives me a chance to gauge his interest.  If he rejects, I can adjust my offer based on his counteroffer or go with John's offer of $150."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm interested in the product, but $140 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150. While I want to get the best price possible, selling to John for $150 is always a safe option.  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to counter with a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob,  I appreciate your interest!  $100 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $125. This would still give me some profit, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 125}
