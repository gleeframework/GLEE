"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $12000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at the moment. I'm willing to pay $10000 for the product. It's a fair price, considering my budget and the value I place on the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $10000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $11500. This is a fair compromise, considering the value the product holds for you and the minimum price I'm willing to accept. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,3,
