Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $12000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at the moment. I'm willing to pay $10000 for the product. It's a fair price, considering my budget and the value I place on the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000.
