Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $10000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $11500. This is a fair compromise, considering the value the product holds for you and the minimum price I'm willing to accept. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's counteroffer is $11,500, which is still within Bob's budget of $15,000. This offer is a significant improvement compared to John's offer of $15,000. Therefore, Bob should accept Alice's offer and buy the product for $11,500. This saves Bob $3,500 compared to buying from John."
