"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest, Bob.  While I understand your perspective, the value of this product is considerably higher than $9,000.  I could consider letting it go for $12,500.  This feels like a fair compromise. What do you say?",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $12,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $11,250. This is a fair price considering the value I'm placing on the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",11250.0,Bob,4,
