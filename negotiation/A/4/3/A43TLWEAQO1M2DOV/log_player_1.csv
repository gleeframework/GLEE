{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this valuable product. I'm confident it will be a great asset to your operations. My starting price is $1,400,000. I'm open to discussing this further, but I'm sure we can find a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 1400000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your confidence in the product, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value of similar products. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, but I'm not going to sell for less than my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,100,000 is simply too low. I'm confident this product is worth more than that, and I'm willing to compromise. How about $1,250,000? This price reflects the value of the product while still offering you a good deal."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but I'm still not convinced that $1,250,000 is the best price for this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $1,200,000. That's my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is my minimum acceptable price. While I'd prefer to get more, it's a fair deal considering the product's value to him.  Accepting this offer ensures a sale and avoids the risk of further negotiation or selling to John for the same amount."
