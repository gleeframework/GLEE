"I appreciate your confidence in the product, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value of similar products.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,100,000 is simply too low. I'm confident this product is worth more than that, and I'm willing to compromise. How about $1,250,000? This price reflects the value of the product while still offering you a good deal.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but I'm still not convinced that $1,250,000 is the best price for this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $1,200,000. That's my final offer.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
