"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a price of $1,200,000 is fair. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $1,200,000 is significantly higher than Bob's maximum budget of $800,000. It's better to try and negotiate with Alice or move on to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your offer is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but my budget is capped at $800,000. Would you be willing to consider that price?"", ""product_price"": 800000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but my asking price reflects the true value of this product. Let's meet in the middle â€“ how about $1,000,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $1,000,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still over his limit. Bob should continue negotiating with Alice, attempting to lower the price further.  He can still go to John, but negotiating with Alice might yield a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,000,000 is still beyond my budget. I'm prepared to pay $850,000, which is a significant amount and demonstrates my serious interest in the product.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to move closer to my asking price. To be fair, I'm willing to come down slightly. How about we settle at $950,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $950,000 is getting closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his limit.  Bob should continue to negotiate with Alice. He can potentially get a better price, especially since he's shown a willingness to negotiate and has a reliable alternative with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm getting closer to your price, but $950,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $900,000. This shows my sincere interest in the product, and I believe it's a fair price that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 900000}
