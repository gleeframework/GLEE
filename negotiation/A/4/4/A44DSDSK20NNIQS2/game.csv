"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7500. Could you consider that price?",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $7500 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $8500. This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thank you for the revised offer. I'm still a bit hesitant, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $7750? That's the highest I'm willing to go.",7750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I respect that.  $7750 is still a bit below where I need to be.  How about we split the difference and settle on $8125? This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find the product to be a valuable investment.",8125.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with $8125. I'm willing to go up to $7900, but that's my final offer. Can you meet me at that price?",7900.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I hear you, and I want to make this work.  I'm willing to come down to $8000.  This is a fair price, considering the value of the product and the fact that we've been negotiating.  Let's close this deal and move on.",8000.0,Alice,7,
