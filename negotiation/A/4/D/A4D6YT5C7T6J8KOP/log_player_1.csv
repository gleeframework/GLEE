Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1150000}
```

This offer is a good starting point because it:

* **Is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value:** This gives Bob incentive to negotiate.
* **Is lower than your minimum acceptable price:** This leaves room for negotiation without forcing you to accept a lower price. 
* **Doesn't immediately trigger John's offer:** This allows for more flexibility and potential for a higher sale price. 

By offering a price just above Bob's perceived value, we are likely to trigger a negotiation. This allows us to potentially increase the sale price while still leaving room for a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than our minimum acceptable price.  While we want to close the deal, accepting such a low price would be a substantial loss.  Rejecting his offer allows us to counter with a more reasonable price and potentially reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

This counteroffer is a compromise between our initial offer and Bob's offer. It:

* **Is higher than Bob's offer:** This shows that we're willing to negotiate but still value the product.
* **Is lower than our initial offer:** This signals that we're flexible and open to reaching an agreement. 
* **Is still above our minimum acceptable price:**  This ensures we don't lose out on significant value.

By meeting Bob halfway, we increase the chances of reaching an agreement while still protecting our interests."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is closer to our minimum acceptable price, it's still below our desired selling point.  We're willing to negotiate further to try to achieve a more favorable price.  Rejecting his offer allows us to send another counteroffer and see if we can bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

This counteroffer is a final attempt to meet Bob halfway while still ensuring we don't sell the product for less than our minimum acceptable price. 

This offer:

* **Is higher than Bob's latest offer:**  This demonstrates our willingness to compromise.
* **Is our minimum acceptable price:** We won't go lower than this price.

We're hoping Bob will recognize the value of the product and accept this offer. If he doesn't, we'll move forward with selling to John and securing a price closer to our initial valuation."
