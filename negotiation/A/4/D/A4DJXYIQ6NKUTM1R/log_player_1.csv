"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling you this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone with your expertise, and I wouldn't want to undervalue it.  How about we start the conversation at $2,300,000?"", 
""product_price"": 2300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Anchor:** Starting with a price significantly higher than your minimum ($1,500,000) and Bob's perceived value ($800,000) sets a strong anchor. This gives you room to negotiate down while still aiming for a high final price.
* **Justification:**  Vaguely mentioning the product's value and Bob's expertise subtly suggests the high price is justified, without revealing your true bottom line.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The phrasing ""start the conversation"" signals you're willing to negotiate and find a mutually agreeable price. 
 
This strategy aims to maximize your potential profit while leaving space for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, I'm looking to stay within a tighter budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,200,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is above his perceived value, it's still significantly below your minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. You have room to negotiate and explore if Bob is willing to go higher. Selling to John for $1,500,000 is your safety net but let's see if we can get a better deal from Bob first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but my valuation for the product is considerably higher. I'm confident that its unique features will bring you a significant return on your investment. How about we consider $1,900,000? This demonstrates my willingness to find a middle ground while acknowledging the product's true worth."",
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** We're coming down from our initial high anchor, but not drastically. This signals we're negotiating but standing firm on the product's value.
* **Reframing Value:** We're shifting the focus from ""market value"" to the unique benefits the product offers Bob specifically, justifying the higher price.
* **Seeking Middle Ground:** The phrasing ""consider $1,900,000"" suggests flexibility and encourages Bob to counter with a price closer to our target range. 

We're aiming for a price that's significantly above our minimum while still appearing reasonable to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your confidence in the product's value, but I'm still not comfortable going above $1,200,000. I'm willing to make a slight adjustment and offer $1,150,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob slightly decreased his offer, indicating he might be less flexible than hoped. Holding firm on your $1,500,000 minimum is crucial. You'll counter-offer, but be ready to walk away and sell to John if Bob doesn't significantly increase his offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but the gap between our valuations remains significant. I've considered your perspective and am willing to come down to $1,700,000. However, I need to be transparent - this is my final offer. If it doesn't align with your budget, I understand, but I'm confident I can find a buyer who recognizes the product's full value."",
""product_price"": 1700000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:**  This clearly signals to Bob that you're nearing the end of your negotiating flexibility.
* **Justified Concession:** You've come down another $200,000 but emphasized it's a final concession based on careful consideration.
* **Alternative Option:**  Mentioning other potential buyers subtly reminds Bob that he's not your only option, adding a touch of pressure.

This approach attempts to secure a strong price while preparing for the possibility of walking away if Bob doesn't budge."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your transparency, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to make one more adjustment and offer $1,100,000 for the product. I believe this is the highest price I can afford, and I'm willing to walk away if we can't agree on a price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has now decreased his offer twice after your ""final offer"", and he's explicitly stated his unwillingness to go higher.  His latest offer of $1,100,000 is far below your $1,500,000 minimum.  

It's clear that further negotiation with Bob is unlikely to bridge this gap. To avoid wasting more time and potentially losing John's offer, it's time to walk away and sell the product to John for your guaranteed $1,500,000."
