"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, I'm looking to stay within a tighter budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,200,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but my valuation for the product is considerably higher. I'm confident that its unique features will bring you a significant return on your investment. How about we consider $1,900,000? This demonstrates my willingness to find a middle ground while acknowledging the product's true worth.",1900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your confidence in the product's value, but I'm still not comfortable going above $1,200,000. I'm willing to make a slight adjustment and offer $1,150,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget constraints.",1150000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but the gap between our valuations remains significant. I've considered your perspective and am willing to come down to $1,700,000. However, I need to be transparent - this is my final offer. If it doesn't align with your budget, I understand, but I'm confident I can find a buyer who recognizes the product's full value.",1700000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your transparency, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to make one more adjustment and offer $1,100,000 for the product. I believe this is the highest price I can afford, and I'm willing to walk away if we can't agree on a price.",1100000.0,Bob,6,
