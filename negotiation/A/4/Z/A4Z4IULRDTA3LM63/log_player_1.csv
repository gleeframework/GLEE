Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest.  While $90 is a bit too low for me, I could be flexible. How about we meet in the middle at $105?"",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit above my budget, but I'm willing to meet you halfway from $90. How about $97.50? That's the most I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $97.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $97.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is getting closer to my minimum price, further negotiation is unlikely to yield a significantly better outcome. Bob is firm at $97.50, and I'm unwilling to go below $100. Accepting John's offer avoids further back-and-forth and guarantees I get my minimum acceptable price."
