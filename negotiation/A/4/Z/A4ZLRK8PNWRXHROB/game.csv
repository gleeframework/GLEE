"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,100,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This price reflects the true value of the product and leaves room for both of us to walk away satisfied.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,050,000 is still a bit high.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $975,000.  This is a fair price considering my initial offer and your last one.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  $975,000 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go down to $1,025,000 as a final compromise. This price reflects a fair value for the product and allows for a smooth transaction.  I'm hoping we can close this deal now.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
