"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to start with a price of $1,200,000.

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I see the value in the product, but $1,200,000 is too high for me. I'd be willing to purchase it for $600,000. Let me know if that works for you.",600000.0,Bob,2,,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand that $1,200,000 is a bit steep for you. However, $600,000 is still below my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so I'm counteroffering at $900,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair price considering the value the product offers.",900000.0,Alice,3,,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me. While $900,000 is closer, I'm aiming for a price closer to $700,000. Would you consider $700,000 for the product?",700000.0,Bob,4,,

"Hi Bob, I see you're still a bit below my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $900,000 and $700,000, so I'm counteroffering at $925,000. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value.",925000.0,Alice,5,,
