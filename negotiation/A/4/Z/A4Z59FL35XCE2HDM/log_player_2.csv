"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to start with a price of $1,200,000. This is the minimum price I'm willing to accept, as it's the minimum value I place on the product. I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand that $1,200,000 is a bit steep for you. However, $600,000 is still below my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so I'm counteroffering at $900,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair price considering the value the product offers. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I see you're still a bit below my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $900,000 and $700,000, so I'm counteroffering at $925,000. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000.

Alice is unlikely to go below $900,000 and is now making smaller concessions.  It's better to secure the product from John at your target price of $800,000."
