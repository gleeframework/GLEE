Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,200,000 might be a stretch for you, but I'm still confident that the product's value is worth more than $500,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $900,000. This is a fair compromise considering its worth to you is $800,000.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $900,000 is still a bit above your budget, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $650,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $750,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to me is $1,500,000.

Alice is unlikely to go much lower, and it's not worth risking a worse deal. John's offer of $800,000 is now the better option."
