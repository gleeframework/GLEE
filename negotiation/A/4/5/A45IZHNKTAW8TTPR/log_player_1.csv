Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I list it publicly. Given its unique value, I'm asking for $19,000.  I believe this is a fair price considering its potential benefits to you. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 19000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get the highest price possible from Bob. 
* **Bob's Valuation:** We know Bob values the product at $10,000. 
* **Our Safety Net:**  We have John as a guaranteed buyer at $15,000. 
* **Negotiation Room:** Starting with a price significantly higher than Bob's valuation ($19,000) allows room for negotiation. It also positions the product as high-value.

**Why this strategy?**

This approach aims to anchor Bob's perception of the product's value at a higher point. While it's unlikely he'll accept $19,000 outright, it opens the door for a counter-offer.  We have a cushion to potentially negotiate down while still remaining above our guaranteed sale price to John."
