"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. This is a great deal for you, as it's significantly less than what it's worth to me. Let me know what you think!",10000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have a limited budget.",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $7,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, though.  How about $9,000? This would still give you a great deal, and it's closer to what I need to get for the product.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down, but I'm still a bit short on budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $8,500?",8500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is still a bit too low. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $9,500, which is my final offer. This is a great price considering the product's value. I have another buyer ready to purchase at a higher price, so this is your last chance to secure this deal. What do you say?",9500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go any higher than $8,500. This is my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider buying from another seller.",8500.0,Bob,6,
