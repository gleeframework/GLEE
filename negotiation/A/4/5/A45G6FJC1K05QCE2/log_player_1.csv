{""product_price"": 15000}

I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum value of $12,000. This gives me room to negotiate down if needed. 

I'll be watching Bob's response closely to assess his interest and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  I will reject his offer and proceed to the next round. I will need to figure out a strategy to bring Bob's offer closer to my desired price range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

I'm counter-offering with a price of $13,000. This is still a good distance from Bob's offer, but it demonstrates I'm willing to negotiate and come down from my initial asking price. This should encourage Bob to move higher in his offers while also setting a clear lower limit for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum than before, it's still below my desired value. I'm going to reject it and continue negotiating.  I'll try to gauge Bob's maximum willingness to pay and see if I can push for a higher offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm offering $11,000,  a compromise to show I'm serious about selling to Bob.  This is closer to Bob's last offer, but still above my minimum. It gives me more room to negotiate, and hopefully,  will encourage Bob to come up with a more reasonable offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offers are still too low for me.  While I'm willing to negotiate, I don't want to keep going back and forth. I'm going to sell to John for $12,000. This guarantees me a reasonable profit, and it saves time and energy."
