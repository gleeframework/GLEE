Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on this product. I know it's something you're interested in. I'm willing to part with it for $14,500. Let me know what you think!"",
""product_price"": 14500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** While I have a guaranteed sale at $15,000, trying to get a higher price from Bob first is advantageous. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $14,500 is a strong starting point. It's significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($12,000) but leaves room for negotiation if needed. 
* **Positive Framing:** The message emphasizes a ""great deal"" to entice Bob and implies a sense of urgency (""willing to part with it""). 
 
**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Negotiation Style:** If I knew Bob was a tough negotiator, I might start even higher.
* **Time Sensitivity:**  If I was in a rush to sell, I might offer a lower price to ensure a quicker sale to Bob."
