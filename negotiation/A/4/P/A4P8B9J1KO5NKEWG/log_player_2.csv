"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this excellent product. Given its quality and features, I'm asking for $22,000. I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $22,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $22,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $22,000 is far above my budget of $8,000.  It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, $22,000 is way above my budget.  I'm interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $8,000 right now.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your interest. I understand your budget constraints, but $8,000 is significantly below its true value.  How about we meet in the middle at $18,000? This reflects the product's quality and potential. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has moved closer to my budget, $18,000 is still too high.  I will continue to negotiate, aiming for a price closer to my $8,000 limit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $18,000 is still outside my comfortable range.  I'm willing to go up to $10,000, which is a significant step for me.  Let's work together to find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $10,000 is closer to the mark, I can't let this go for less than $15,000.  This is my bottom line, reflecting the true value of this product.  I believe you'll see a significant return on this investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $15,000 is still too high for me, as I am aiming to spend no more than $8,000.  While I could continue negotiating, the risk is that we'll run out of rounds and I'll be forced to pay more than I want.  I'm confident that I can get the same product from John for $8,000, so that's the best option for me at this point."
