"Hi Bob, I'm happy to offer you my product. I believe it's a valuable asset that would be a great addition to your business. I'm asking for $1,000,000 for it. This price reflects the product's true worth and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let me know what you think!",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I think the product is indeed valuable, but I'm not sure I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for it. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900,000. I believe this price still reflects the product's value, but it's a bit more within my budget. Let me know what you think!",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. While I appreciate your interest, $900,000 is still a bit lower than what I'm hoping for. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This price still provides a good return for me while allowing you a substantial benefit from the product.  Let's see if we can make this work.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to come down in price. However, I'm still not comfortable with $950,000. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $920,000. I believe this price is more reasonable and allows us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. Let me know what you think!",920000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $920,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $935,000. This price reflects the value of the product for both of us and allows us to come to a fair agreement. Let's close this deal.",935000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I'm getting the sense we're both close to an agreement.  Let's split the difference one more time. I'm happy to accept $930,000. This will ensure a successful outcome for both of us and move this deal forward.  Let me know if this works for you.",930000.0,Alice,7,
