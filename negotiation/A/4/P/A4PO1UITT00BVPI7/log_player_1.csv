Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really enjoy it. I'm offering it to you for $100. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
```

This offer is above Bob's perceived value of $80, but still leaves room for negotiation. It also shows that you're willing to be flexible, which can be a good tactic in negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the recommendation. I would like to propose a price of $90 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 
 
While $90 is below my ideal price, it's still above my minimum acceptable value of $120. Accepting Bob's offer allows me to close the deal quickly without further negotiation. This avoids the risk of Bob ultimately declining and me having to sell to John for my minimum price."
