**Reasoning:**

Bob appears to be anchored at $950,000 and is unlikely to move significantly higher. While continuing negotiations might yield a slightly better price, it's unlikely to be worth the risk of losing a guaranteed $1,200,000 from John.  It's time to walk away from the negotiation with Bob and secure the guaranteed sale."
