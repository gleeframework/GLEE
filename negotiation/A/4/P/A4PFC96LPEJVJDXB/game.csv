"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Given my budget, I'd like to offer you $900,000 for the product.  I believe this is a fair price considering its value to both of us. ",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,025,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $950,000. This is a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the product's value. ",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $980,000 is still a bit more than I can comfortably spend.  I'm going to stick with my last offer of $950,000. I'm confident this is a fair price considering the value to both of us, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement. ",950000.0,Bob,6,
