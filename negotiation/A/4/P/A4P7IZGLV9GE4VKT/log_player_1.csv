Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $10,000.  This is a good starting point as it's higher than my minimum but leaves room for negotiation.  I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium, but I'm also prepared to lower the price if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is very close to my minimum acceptable price.  Accepting his offer is the best option to secure a sale and get a good price."
