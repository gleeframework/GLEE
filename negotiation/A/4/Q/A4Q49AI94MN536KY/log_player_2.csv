"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a great opportunity to get your hands on something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $130. It's a fair price considering the value it brings. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $130 is within his budget, he can likely get a better deal.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to start negotiating and potentially secure a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $130 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $115 for the product.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 115}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $115. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $125. It's a fair price considering the product's value and the effort I've put into it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is within Bob's budget:** $125 is less than Bob's maximum of $150.
* **It's a good deal for Bob:** While Bob initially wanted $115, this offer is only $10 more.
* **Risk of further negotiation:**  There's a risk that if Bob rejects this offer, Alice might not budge further, or the negotiation might drag on. 

Overall, accepting this offer is the best strategy to ensure Bob gets the product while saving money."
