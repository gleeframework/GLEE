Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I do have other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, you can afford to start high.  A price of $1,500,000 aims to capture some of the potential surplus value for you.
* **Sense of urgency:**  Mentioning ""other interested parties"" and a ""limited-time offer"" might encourage Bob to act quickly and potentially accept the higher price.
* **Justification:** While not explicitly stated, the message implies the product's value justifies the price, without revealing your absolute bottom line. 

**Important Note:**  This strategy involves a degree of risk. If Bob finds the price too high and rejects it, you'll have to settle for the guaranteed $1,200,000 from John."
