I'm still not quite there with Bob's offer. It's getting closer, but I want to see if we can squeeze out a bit more.  I'll reject his offer and try to get closer to my desired price in the next few rounds.  It's worth the risk, as I still have time to sell to John if the negotiation with Bob fails."

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  We're very close to my minimum desired price, and we're down to the final two rounds.  It's a good deal for me, and it's likely that Bob won't budge further.  There's a risk that I could lose the deal entirely if I reject his offer and he decides to walk away.  It's better to secure this sale at this point."
