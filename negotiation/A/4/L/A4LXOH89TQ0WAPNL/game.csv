"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your interest. However, $900,000 is still a bit below what I'm looking for. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This reflects the value of the product and gives us both a fair deal. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  How about we meet in the middle at $950,000?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to continue the discussion.  While I appreciate your offer, $950,000 is still a bit low.  Let's try $975,000.  This feels like a fair compromise and keeps us both moving towards a deal.  What do you think?",975000.0,Alice,5,
