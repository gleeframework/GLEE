"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a mutually beneficial deal. I'm willing to start with an offer of $18000 for the product. What are your thoughts?",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. I believe that's a more reasonable price for this product, considering the market value and my budget.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $12000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $16000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value it brings to the table.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $13500, but I think that's as high as I can go. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price.",13500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob. However, I'm still a bit below my target price. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair deal. I'm now offering the product to you for $17000. This is a bit higher than my previous offer, but I think it's a reasonable price considering the value of the product.",17000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm still a bit hesitant about the price, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle again. I'm thinking $14500 is a fair price for the product. I'm hoping we can find a deal that works for both of us.",14500.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle again, Bob. However, I'm still a bit below my target price. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair deal. I'm now offering the product to you for $16500. This is a bit higher than your last offer, but I think it's a reasonable price considering the value of the product.",16500.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm getting a bit frustrated with the back-and-forth, but I'm still willing to negotiate. I'm thinking $14000 is the absolute maximum I'm willing to pay. I'd like to get as close to the original price as possible, but I need to stay within my budget.",14000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get as close to the original price as possible, Bob. However, I've already made several concessions and I'm not willing to go below $17000. I'm willing to make one final offer to meet you in the middle, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair deal. I'm now offering the product to you for $16250. This is a compromise, but I think it's the best we can do at this point.",16250.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I've made it clear that I'm willing to pay up to $14000, and I'm not willing to go any higher. I'm starting to think that buying the product from John for $15000 might be the best option for me. Can you meet me at $14000 or is this the final offer?",14000.0,Bob,10,
