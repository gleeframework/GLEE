"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for you, and it's worth more than $8,000 to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $10,000. This is a good starting point because it's above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. It's also a good compromise as it's a bit more than halfway between my minimum price ($12,000) and his perceived value ($8,000). I'm optimistic that Bob will accept, but I'm also prepared to counter-offer if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $8,000. Can you meet me in the middle at $9,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $9,000 is closer to my minimum price, it's still below what I'm willing to accept. I'm going to counter Bob's offer and see if we can come to a more agreeable price. I'm not yet ready to sell to John, as there's still potential to get closer to my desired price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $9,500. This is a fair price for both of us, and it's a great deal considering the value of the product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

I'm counter-offering at $9,500. This is a compromise that shows I'm willing to negotiate, but it's still close enough to my minimum price that it's worth continuing the negotiation. I'm hoping that Bob will see the value in this offer and agree to it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $9,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $8,500, which is the highest I can go. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

$8,500 is still too low for me. I'm willing to keep negotiating with Bob for a better price.  I'm not ready to sell to John yet, as I believe there's still room for improvement in the deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $8,500 is simply not enough for me.  Let's split the difference and go with $9,250.  This is a fair price that allows us both to get a good deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9250}
```

I'm counter-offering at $9,250. This is a compromise that splits the difference between our last offers and hopefully shows Bob I'm willing to negotiate seriously. I'm hoping he'll agree to this price, as it's still closer to my minimum price than his."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but $9,250 is still not within my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,250 and $8,500, which would be $8,875. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,875. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,875
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $8,875 is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum. I believe there's room for improvement in the negotiation, and I'm not ready to sell to John yet. I'll continue to counter Bob's offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $8,875 is simply not enough for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more to $9,000. This is my final offer, and it's still a great deal for you considering the product's value. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

I'm counter-offering at $9,000. This is a final compromise that's closer to my minimum price and hopefully a good deal for Bob as well.  I'm hoping Bob will accept this final offer and we can close the deal."
