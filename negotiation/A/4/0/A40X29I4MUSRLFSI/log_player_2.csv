"Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

You can get the product for $12,000 from John, so you want to try to get it from Alice for less. Rejecting the offer allows you to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice values the product at $10,000.  By offering $10,500, I'm showing a willingness to negotiate while still staying within my budget. This gives Alice some room to bargain while still potentially saving me money compared to buying from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $11,000 is lower than John's price of $12,000, and it's still within my budget of $12,000. It's likely that Alice won't go lower, so accepting this offer secures the product at a good price."
