"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really enjoy it. I'm offering it to you for $140, which is a great deal considering its value. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $140 is a good deal compared to Alice's value, Bob can still potentially get a better price. By rejecting the offer, Bob can start negotiating and try to push the price down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $140 is a bit high for me right now.  I'm willing to pay $125 for it.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 125}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I can't go that low.  How about we split the difference and go with $132.50?  It's still a great deal for you, and it's closer to what I'm looking for. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $132.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $132.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to get the best deal possible.  While $132.50 is closer to his ideal price, he can likely push it down further.  By rejecting Alice's offer, Bob can keep negotiating and try to get closer to his goal of $120 or even lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $132.50 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $130.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 130}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but I'm still not comfortable going down to $130.  How about we meet in the middle again at $131.25?  It's a small difference, and it would allow us to both walk away feeling good about the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $131.25. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $131.25
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has been trying to negotiate the price down, but it seems like Alice is firm on $131.25. While this is a lower price than Alice's initial offer, it's still higher than Bob's maximum budget of $120.  Given the limited rounds remaining, Bob can't afford to continue negotiating with Alice and risk reaching the final round without a deal.  It's more beneficial for Bob to buy the product from John at his fixed price of $120, ensuring he stays within his budget."
