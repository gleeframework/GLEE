"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its unique value and features, I'm initially offering it for $22,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $22,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $22,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's starting offer is way too high. It's important to bring the price down significantly.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $22,000 is way above my budget. This product would need to be significantly lower for me to consider it. How about $6,000?"",
""product_price"": 6000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive Starting Point:** I'm starting with a very low offer ($6,000) to try and anchor the negotiation closer to my desired range. While Alice is unlikely to accept this, it shows I'm serious about a much lower price.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** This initial counteroffer leaves plenty of space for Alice to counter and for us to hopefully meet somewhere in the middle.
* **Alternative Option:** I'm keeping in mind that I can always buy from John for $8,000. This gives me a strong fallback position and prevents me from feeling pressured to accept a bad deal from Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest but $6,000 is significantly below its true value. To find a middle ground, I could come down to $18,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too High:** While Alice came down from her initial offer, $18,000 is still significantly more than I'm willing to pay. 
* **Negotiation Progress:**  Alice's counteroffer shows she's willing to negotiate, which is a good sign. I need to signal that I'm also willing to move, but not by too much just yet. 
* **Time Consideration:**  I have several rounds left, so I can afford to be a bit more patient in my approach. 
 
I'll continue negotiating with a counteroffer closer to my target range in the next round."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you being willing to move on the price. To be honest,  $18,000 is still a bit outside of what I had in mind. Could you consider something closer to $10,000?"",
""product_price"": 10000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Increase:** I'm increasing my offer to $10,000, which shows Alice I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm still well below her current price.
* **Justification:** By saying ""$18,000 is still a bit outside of what I had in mind,"" I'm subtly reinforcing my budget constraints without explicitly revealing my upper limit.
* **Open for Counter:** This counteroffer leaves room for Alice to propose a counter that's closer to my desired range. 
* **John Option:** I'm still mindful of my option to buy from John, so I'm prepared to walk away if the negotiation doesn't move favorably."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm seeing a gap in our valuations here. I can't go as low as $10,000, but to demonstrate my willingness to make a deal, I can offer it for $15,500. This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer Tactic:** Alice is using a common negotiation tactic by declaring this her ""final offer."" This is designed to put pressure on me to accept.
* **Still Too High:** Even with the price reduction, $15,500 is still considerably more than my $8,000 limit and my previous offer of $10,000.
* **Calculated Risk:** I'll call Alice's bluff by rejecting this offer. There's a risk she'll walk away, but I'm betting she's still willing to negotiate, especially since we're getting closer to a potential compromise.

I'll use the next round to present a counteroffer closer to $12,000 as a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, and I appreciate you coming down.  However, to be realistic, $15,500 is still a bit of a stretch for me. How about we meet in the middle at $12,000? That feels like a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 12000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Middle Ground:** I'm suggesting $12,000 as a compromise, which is a significant move from my previous offer and acknowledges Alice's willingness to negotiate as well.
* **Sense of Urgency:** While I haven't explicitly mentioned it, suggesting a compromise creates a sense of urgency and encourages Alice to reach a deal.
* **Alternative Option:**  I'm keeping the $8,000 option from John in my back pocket. If Alice is completely inflexible, I can always walk away."
