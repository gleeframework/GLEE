{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'll love! I'm offering it to you for $100. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm offering the product at $100, which is a good starting point. It's above Bob's perceived value, but still lower than my minimum acceptable price. This gives him a reason to consider the offer.
* **Message:** I'm friendly and encouraging, making it more likely for Bob to engage in the negotiation. 

**Strategy:**

By starting at $100, I'm hoping to get a quick agreement with Bob. If he rejects, I'll be prepared to counter-offer closer to my minimum price. However, I'm also keeping in mind the option of selling to John for $120, which I can do at any point if the negotiation with Bob stalls or becomes unproductive."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. That's the price I'm willing to pay for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $80 is better than nothing, it's significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $120.  I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I'm confident I can get a better price from either him or John. 

**Next Steps:**

I will counter-offer Bob with a price closer to my minimum, but still keeping in mind his willingness to pay.  This will allow me to see if we can reach a mutually acceptable agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $80 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference? I'm willing to go down to $90 for you. Let's make this happen! "", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm counter-offering at $90, which is exactly halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer. This demonstrates flexibility and willingness to compromise while still remaining above my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Message:** I'm staying positive and friendly, reiterating my desire to reach an agreement with Bob. I'm also suggesting we ""split the difference"" to appeal to his sense of fairness. 

**Strategy:**

By counter-offering at $90, I'm hoping to strike a balance between maximizing my profit and encouraging Bob to accept. If he rejects this offer, I'll have to consider more seriously selling to John at $120. However, I'm still optimistic that we can find a mutually beneficial solution."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about $87.50? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $87.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $87.5 is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'm rejecting his offer, as I believe I can still negotiate a higher price. 

**Next Steps:**

I will counter-offer Bob with a price that is closer to my minimum. I want to see if we can reach a mutually acceptable price or if selling to John at $120 is the better option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up in your offer. While $87.50 is closer, I'm still hoping we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to go down to $95.  What do you think? "", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm counter-offering at $95, which is a small concession from my previous offer but still significantly above Bob's last offer. This demonstrates a willingness to compromise while maintaining a price that's closer to my desired range.
* **Message:**  I'm staying positive and  reiterating the need for a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm keeping the tone friendly and encouraging Bob to continue the negotiation.

**Strategy:**

I'm hoping this counteroffer will be enough to convince Bob to accept, as it's significantly closer to his last offer. However, I'm also prepared to potentially sell to John for $120 if Bob continues to be unwilling to budge. This strategy balances the need to maximize profit with the risk of losing a sale."
