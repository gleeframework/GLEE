Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of the significant benefits you'll gain from it."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price closer to Bob's perceived value ($1,500,000) than my minimum acceptable price ($800,000). This leaves room for negotiation and maximizes potential profit.
* **Justification:**  The message emphasizes the product's ""value and potential,"" subtly justifying the high price. 
* **Alternative in Mind:** I know I have John as a backup buyer, so I'm comfortable taking a slightly bolder stance in the initial offer. 
* **Leaving Negotiation Room:** The offer aims to open a dialogue. If Bob counters, I can still negotiate down while staying above my minimum."
