Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $650000 is a significant amount, but I'm still looking to get a good return on my investment. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $675000. This is a fair compromise considering the value you've placed on the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $675,000.

Alice has come down to $675,000, which is a good price for you.  It's better than John's price and you've already shown Alice you're willing to negotiate.  Accepting the offer avoids further negotiation and potential delays."
