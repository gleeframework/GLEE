Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $750000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering the value I see in it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $750,000 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. I want to see if I can get closer to my target price by continuing the negotiation."

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $850000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm happy to meet you halfway between our last offers. Let's try $800000. It's a good deal for both of us, and I believe it reflects the true value of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000.
