"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think would be very valuable to you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. It's a great deal considering the value it holds for you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice's offer of $12,000 is tempting, you know you can get the product for $8,000 from John. Rejecting this offer opens the possibility of a counter-offer from Alice that might be closer to your budget. If not, you're still guaranteed a better deal with John."
