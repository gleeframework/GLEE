"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic product that I believe will be highly valuable to you. Given its unique features and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. What are your thoughts on this?"",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I begin with a strong offer slightly below Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000). This leaves room for negotiation while aiming for a significant profit. 
* **Gauging Bob's Response:** This first offer is designed to gauge Bob's initial reaction and willingness to negotiate. His response will help me understand his strategy and adjust my approach in subsequent rounds. 
* **Alternative Option:** I'm keeping in mind that I have the option to sell to John for $800,000. This provides a safety net and influences my decisions, ensuring I don't settle for a price significantly lower."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me.  Considering the value to both of us, I'd be willing to pay $950,000. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $950,000 is a good offer, I believe there's still room for negotiation. Bob's counteroffer indicates he's willing to pay a significant amount, but his initial offer was quite low, suggesting he might be willing to go higher. I'll aim to meet somewhere in the middle in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $950,000 is a significant offer, the value this product brings to the table is substantial. I'm willing to come down a bit, how about we meet in the middle at $1,025,000?"",
""product_price"": 1025000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  By suggesting $1,025,000, I'm splitting the difference between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. This demonstrates a willingness to compromise while still aiming for a price significantly above my minimum. 
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm reiterating the product's value to justify a higher price point than Bob's initial offer.
* **Strategic Positioning:**  This counteroffer keeps the negotiation moving and allows me to gauge Bob's flexibility. Depending on his response, I can adjust my approach in subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I see you're willing to compromise.  I'm happy to meet you halfway, but $1,025,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm confident we can find a solution that works for both of us.  How about $987,500? That's closer to my initial offer and represents a significant savings for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $987,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $987,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is clearly employing a strategy of incremental increases. While $987,500 is a tempting offer, I believe he's willing to go higher.  I'm comfortable rejecting this offer to see if I can push for a slightly better deal in the next round. The risk of losing the deal entirely seems low, as he's consistently engaging in the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're right, finding a solution that works for both of us is key.  Let's aim for a round number - how about $1,010,000? That's acknowledging your willingness to move while recognizing the inherent value of what I'm offering."",
""product_price"": 1010000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Conceding Slightly:** I'm lowering my price by $15,000, a smaller concession than Bob's previous move. This shows I'm still negotiating but holding firm on a price above $1,000,000.
* **Round Number Tactic:** Suggesting $1,010,000 feels cleaner and might make Bob more amenable, as people are often drawn to round figures.
* **Time Consideration:** We are now past the halfway point in the negotiation rounds.  I need to apply a bit more pressure to avoid running out of time and having to accept a lower offer or sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer and we're definitely making progress. I'm still not quite there. How about $995,000?  That's a significant amount of savings for me, and we can close the deal quickly. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $995,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $995,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

It's time to close the deal. Here's why:

* **Strong Offer:** $995,000 is a significant profit, well above my minimum and very close to my desired range. 
* **Time Pressure:** We're approaching the later rounds, and further haggling over smaller increments might not be worth the risk of losing the deal entirely. 
* **Bob's Pattern:** Bob has consistently shown a willingness to negotiate and increase his offer, but in smaller increments. It's unlikely he'll dramatically jump to my desired price.

Accepting this offer secures a substantial profit and avoids the uncertainty of continued negotiation."
