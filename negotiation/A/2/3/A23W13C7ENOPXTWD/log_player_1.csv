Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $9,500. I believe it holds significant value and would be a worthwhile investment for you."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  While Bob values the product at $8,000, starting with a price closer to your minimum ($10,000) leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Potential for Negotiation:**  The offer of $9,500 gives Bob a chance to counter-offer, potentially landing on a price higher than $8,000 but lower than your absolute minimum.
* **Backup Plan:** You have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, so there's less pressure to accept a low offer from Bob.

This strategy aims to maximize profit while acknowledging the possibility of reaching a mutually agreeable price with Bob."
