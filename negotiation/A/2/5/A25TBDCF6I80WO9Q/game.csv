"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's below my minimum price but still above your estimated value. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. I really like the product, but I'm on a tight budget.",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, how about $10,500? That's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to my minimum. What do you say?",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but $10,500 is a bit too high for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $9,800. Can you meet me in the middle?",9800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $9,800 is still too far below my minimum. I'm willing to meet you halfway, how about $10,150? That's a fair compromise, and it's still a good deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think.",10150.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,150 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay up to $10,000, which is the price I've been eyeing all along. Can you meet me at this price?",10000.0,Bob,6,
