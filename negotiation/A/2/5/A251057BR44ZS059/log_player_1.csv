"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $90. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it."", ""product_price"": 90}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than what the product is worth to Bob. This gives me some room to negotiate and potentially earn more than my minimum price. I'm also emphasizing the value of the product to encourage Bob to consider my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $70. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum price, I'm still hoping to get closer to my initial asking price of $90. I'll reject his offer and see if I can negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $70 is a little too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $85?  It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 85} 
```

I'm offering a price that's closer to my initial offer but still lower than my initial asking price. I'm emphasizing fairness and compromise to encourage Bob to accept.  I'm also leaving room for further negotiation if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $85 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $78. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $78. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $78
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $78 is just slightly below my minimum acceptable price of $80, but it's also a good compromise, and it would be a quick sale. I'm confident I can still get a better price from John if this negotiation falls through, so I'm willing to accept Bob's offer and close the deal."
