"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product!  It's a valuable asset that can really benefit your business.  I'm willing to let it go for $1200000. This is a significant price reduction from what it's worth to me, but I believe it's a fair deal for both of us.  What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your time and consideration, Alice. I'm very interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's worth to you is $1500000, and I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchasing it.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand your perspective. While $900000 is a significant price, it's unfortunately too low for me. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $1050000. This allows for a fair profit for you and helps me get closer to my desired price. Let me know if you're interested in moving forward with this counteroffer.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit far from being comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $950000. I think that's a fair price for both of us, considering the product's value and the market conditions.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position and I'm willing to continue negotiating.  However,  $950000 is still a bit too low for me. To find common ground, I'm willing to come down to $1000000. This price reflects the value of the product and allows both of us to make a fair deal. Let's find a resolution that works for both of us.",1000000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm starting to think that buying from John might be the better option. However, I'm still willing to give you a chance to meet my budget. I'm thinking of $925000 as a final offer. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'll have to consider other options.",925000.0,Bob,6,
