"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,300,000 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to be closer to my initial price. How about $1,600,000?  Let's find a compromise that works for both of us.",1600000.0,Alice,3,,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit short on budget. Can we meet in the middle between $1,450,000 and $1,600,000? I'm thinking $1,525,000 might be a sweet spot for both of us.",1525000.0,Bob,4,,
