Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it."", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **$100 is a good starting point:** It's above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation if needed. 
* **The message is friendly and encouraging:** It emphasizes the value for Bob and creates a positive tone.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts the offer, you've successfully sold the product for a decent price.
* If Bob rejects the offer, I'll analyze his counteroffer and decide whether to accept or counter. If needed, I'll consider the possibility of selling to John for $120."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of a price around $90. Could you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** While it's closer to my minimum of $120, it's still below my desired earnings.
* **There's room for negotiation:** I can counter with a price closer to my initial offer of $100, potentially finding a compromise.
* **Selling to John is a safe option:** However, I'd rather try to negotiate further with Bob before resorting to John.

**Next Steps:**

* I will counter Bob's offer with a price of $95. This should be high enough to potentially secure a sale while still being lower than my initial price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $90 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $95.  Let's meet in the middle on this, what do you think?"", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** My counteroffer of $95 is a compromise between my initial offer of $100 and Bob's offer of $90. This shows willingness to negotiate and reach a mutually acceptable price.
* **Maintaining a positive tone:** The message is friendly and encouraging, emphasizing the potential for a successful agreement.
* **Reiterating value:** The message highlights the value of the product and encourages Bob to consider the offer.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts my counteroffer, I've successfully sold the product for a price closer to my desired amount.
* If Bob rejects my counteroffer, I'll need to consider his next counteroffer and potentially sell the product to John for $120."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $92? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:**  $92 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $120. 
* **Further negotiation unlikely to yield much more:**  Bob has shown he's not willing to go much higher, and further negotiation might risk losing the deal entirely.
* **Selling to John is still an option:** While I'd prefer to sell to Bob, I can still sell to John for $120 if this deal falls through.

**Next Steps:**

* I will accept Bob's offer and sell the product for $92. This ensures a quick and relatively successful sale."
