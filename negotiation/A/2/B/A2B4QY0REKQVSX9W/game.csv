"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but $1,200,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,150,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to get an amazing product at a great price. Let me know what you think!",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,150,000 is still a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000. This is a fair compromise that's in both of our best interests. What do you think?",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your willingness to compromise, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to go below $1,200,000. I'm willing to give you a slight discount, and I'll offer it to you for $1,125,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a great deal for you. Let me know what you think!",1125000.0,Alice,5,
