"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to invest in this valuable item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $11,500. This is a competitive price, considering the product's worth to you is $10,000. I'm confident you'll find it a great value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is within your budget, you can potentially get a better deal by negotiating. You're aiming to save as much money as possible, and the option to buy from John for $10,000 sets a clear lower limit on what you're willing to pay.  Rejecting the offer allows you to start the negotiation process."
