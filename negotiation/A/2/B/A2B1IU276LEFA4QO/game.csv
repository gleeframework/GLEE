"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm. However, $11,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me, and I'm confident it's a win-win situation for both of us.",10500.0,Bob,2,
