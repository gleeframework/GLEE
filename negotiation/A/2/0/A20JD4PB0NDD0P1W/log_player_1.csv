"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $135.  It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very useful.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 135}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I want to start with a price that's closer to my minimum value ($150) to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Not too high:** $135 is still within the range where Bob might be interested, as his value is $120.
* **Positive tone:** A friendly message helps build rapport and encourages Bob to consider the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $125. Would you be willing to meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:**  While $125 is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum of $150. 
* **Negotiation room:**  I want to see if I can get a better price.  Rejecting his offer allows me to counter and potentially get closer to my desired price.
* **John's offer:**  Keeping John's offer in mind provides a safety net.  If I can't get a better price from Bob, I can always sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $125 is a bit too low for me right now.  How about we split the difference and go with $130? I'm confident you'll find the product worth it."", ""product_price"": 130}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** I'm proposing to meet Bob halfway between his offer and my previous offer, demonstrating flexibility.
* **Staying above minimum:** $130 is still above my minimum value, ensuring I don't sell at a loss.
* **Reiterating value:**  I emphasize the value of the product to encourage Bob to consider the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant at $130. Would you be willing to go down to $127? I really like the product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $127. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $127
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:** $127 is still below my minimum desired price of $150. 
* **Room for compromise:** While Bob is getting closer, I still believe there's room for a higher offer.
* **John's offer is a strong backup:**  I'm not desperate to sell to Bob, and I can always get $150 from John if the negotiations fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $127 is still a little too low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $129.  This is a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 129}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small concession:** I'm making a small concession to show flexibility, but still staying above my minimum price.
* **Highlighting value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's worth to encourage him to close the deal. 
* **Stronger position:** Since I have John's offer as a backup, I can afford to be more firm in my negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not comfortable with $129. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $127 and $129, which would be $128. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $128. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $128
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:** While $128 is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum of $150.
* **Limited negotiation room:** We've been going back and forth, and there's not much room left to raise the price.
* **John's offer is enticing:** Selling to John for $150 is a safer option, especially considering we're getting close to the end of the negotiations."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I understand you're looking for the best deal, but $128 is still below my minimum.  I'm willing to go down to $129, but that's my final offer.  It's a great price considering the value you'll get from this product.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 129}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final offer:** I'm stating this is my final offer to signal a sense of urgency and encourage Bob to accept.

* **Limited time:** With only 3 rounds left, the pressure is on to make a decision."
