"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $1,750,000. It's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1750000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand the value of your product, but I am only able to offer $1,500,000 for it. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

While I would prefer to get closer to my ideal price, Bob's offer of $1,500,000 is my minimum acceptable price. It's better to secure the sale now than to risk losing both Bob and potentially John in further negotiation rounds."
