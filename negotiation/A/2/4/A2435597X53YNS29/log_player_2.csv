Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer. While I understand you're working with a tighter budget, $1,100,000 is unfortunately too far below my minimum acceptable price. To make this work, I'd need to be closer to $1,500,000. How about we split the difference and go with $1,300,000? It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product while being within your budget. Let me know your thoughts on this.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, and I appreciate your continued interest.  $1,200,000 is still a bit lower than I need to be, but I'm willing to compromise.  I'm happy to come down to $1,250,000.  This represents a fair price for both of us, allowing for a successful transaction.  What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:

Alice is clearly willing to negotiate but is holding firm around the $1,250,000 mark. It's unlikely further negotiation will yield significantly better results, and going with John will cost more. This is a reasonable compromise and a good deal."
