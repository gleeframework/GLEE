"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you my product for your consideration. It's a unique and valuable asset, and I believe it would be a great fit for your needs. My asking price for it is $1,750,000.

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but I'm working with a tighter budget. Would you consider $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer. While I understand you're working with a tighter budget, $1,100,000 is unfortunately too far below my minimum acceptable price. To make this work, I'd need to be closer to $1,500,000. How about we split the difference and go with $1,300,000? It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product while being within your budget. Let me know your thoughts on this.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  While $1,300,000 is closer, it's still a bit of a stretch.  How about $1,200,000?  That's a significant investment on my end, but I believe in the value of the product.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, and I appreciate your continued interest.  $1,200,000 is still a bit lower than I need to be, but I'm willing to compromise.  I'm happy to come down to $1,250,000.  This represents a fair price for both of us, allowing for a successful transaction.  What are your thoughts?",1250000.0,Alice,5,
