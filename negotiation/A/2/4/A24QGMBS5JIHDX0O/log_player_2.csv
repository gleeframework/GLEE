"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. Given its value to you, I believe we can reach a fair agreement. I propose a price of $12,000 for the product. This price reflects its worth while allowing us to close the deal. Let me know if this proposal works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $12,000 is better than $15,000, there's still room for negotiation and potentially saving more money.  Bob can counteroffer to see if he can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $12,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to pay a bit less.  How about $10,500? I'm confident this is a fair price that reflects the value to both of us."", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. After considering your offer, I would like to counter with a price of $11,500 for the product. This price still reflects the value of the product to both parties and aims to find a mutually beneficial solution. I look forward to your consideration of this proposal.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
Bob should accept Alice's offer. $11,500 is a good price, considering his maximum budget is $15,000. He's already saved $3,500 compared to buying from John. Continuing to negotiate might save him another few hundred dollars, but it's not worth the risk of Alice rejecting his counteroffer and him potentially having to buy at the higher price from John."
