Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm asking for $100 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $100, which is above my minimum but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Leaving Room for Compromise:** Bob values the product at $120, so there's a potential for a win-win situation.
* **Friendliness:** The message is friendly and inviting, making Bob more likely to engage in the negotiation. 

**Next Steps:**

* **If Bob accepts:** Great! I've made a decent profit.
* **If Bob rejects:** I'll analyze his counteroffer and decide whether to accept it or make a counteroffer of my own, keeping in mind my minimum price of $80 and the potential deal with John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer Alice, I appreciate it. I'm interested but  $100 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. How about $85?  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Below My Minimum:** $85 is below my minimum selling price of $80. While it's tempting to accept, I'm committed to earning at least $80.
* **Negotiation Potential:** There's still room for negotiation. I can make a counteroffer to Bob, potentially getting closer to my desired price.
* **John as a Safety Net:**  I can always fall back on selling to John for $80 if the negotiation with Bob fails.

**Next Steps:**

I'll counter Bob's offer with a price closer to my minimum, hoping to reach a compromise that's mutually beneficial."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your interest. While $85 is a bit lower than I'd hoped, I'm willing to go down to $90.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 90} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm moving closer to Bob's offer, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate. 
* **Maintaining Value:**  $90 is still above my minimum and leaves me with a decent profit.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm keeping the communication positive and open to finding a solution.

**Next Steps:**

* **If Bob accepts:** Great! I've secured a good price.
* **If Bob rejects:** I'll assess the situation. If his next offer is still below $80, I'll likely sell to John to avoid losing money."
