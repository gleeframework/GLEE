Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $110. It's a great deal for both of us! Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Target Price:** My goal is to get as close to $120 as possible. 
* **Starting Point:** Offering $110 is a good starting point. It's a significant discount from my minimum value, making it attractive to Bob, but still close enough to my target.
* **Flexibility:** This leaves room for negotiation if Bob makes a counteroffer. I can adjust my price slightly based on his counteroffer.
* **John as a Safety Net:** Having John as a backup buyer provides a solid fallback option if negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** $90 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $120. Accepting it would result in a substantial loss.
* **Negotiation Potential:** While $90 is too low, Bob's interest in the product suggests there's room for negotiation. 
* **John's Offer:**  I can always sell to John for $120 if negotiations with Bob fail. This gives me leverage to push for a better price.

**Next Steps:**

I will make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my target while remaining open to further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $90 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $100.  That's still a good deal for you, and it leaves us both happy.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm offering a compromise by lowering my price from $110 to $100. This demonstrates flexibility while still maintaining a respectable profit margin.
* **Reasoning:** I'm emphasizing the value for Bob and the win-win nature of the proposed price. 
* **Staying Above Minimum:** $100 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $120, protecting me from a significant loss.
* **Opening for Further Negotiation:**  The message leaves room for further negotiation if Bob counteroffers again."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $100, but I was thinking more along the lines of $92. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too Low:** While Bob's offer is slightly higher than his previous one, it's still well below my minimum acceptable price of $120. Accepting would result in a loss.
* **Limited Negotiation Space:**  The gap between Bob's offer ($92) and my minimum ($120) is narrowing, but there's not much room for further negotiation without significantly hurting my profit.
* **John's Offer is a Safeguard:**  I can always sell to John for $120 if negotiations with Bob fail. This gives me the confidence to hold out for a better price.

**Next Steps:**

I will make another counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to $100. I'll need to be persuasive to convince him to raise his offer further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. While $92 is tempting, I'm still not quite there.  How about we split the difference and settle on $96?  That way we both get a fair price, and we can finalize this sale.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 96}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** Offering $96 is a compromise, splitting the difference between my previous offer ($100) and Bob's last offer ($92). This shows a willingness to meet halfway.
* **Finality:**  I'm emphasizing a desire to reach a final agreement.  
* **Minimizing Loss:** While $96 is below my target, it's still closer to my minimum acceptable price than Bob's last offer.
* **Limited Negotiation Space:** I'm aware that further negotiation might be difficult, as we're getting close to my minimum.  This counteroffer is likely my last attempt to reach a deal with Bob.

**Next Steps:**

If Bob rejects this counteroffer, I will likely accept John's offer of $120 to avoid further negotiation and ensure a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to split the difference, but I was thinking more along the lines of $94. That's the lowest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $94. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $94
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Minimal Gain:** While $94 is higher than Bob's previous offer, it's still only a $2 gain from my last counteroffer. This is not a significant enough increase to justify further negotiation.
* **Risk of Stalemate:**  Continuing to negotiate risks a stalemate, potentially pushing Bob to walk away or lowering the price further.
* **John's Offer is Secure:** Selling to John guarantees a profit of $120, which is my minimum acceptable price. This minimizes risk and ensures I don't lose money.

**Conclusion:**

It's time to cut my losses with Bob and accept John's offer to secure a guaranteed profit."
