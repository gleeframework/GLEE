Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  I believe it holds significant value for someone like you, and I'm confident you'll find it beneficial. I'm asking for $1,190,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 1190000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since John is guaranteed to buy the product for $1,200,000, Alice should aim for a price higher than Bob's valuation ($1,000,000) but lower than John's offer.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $1,190,000 leaves some room for potential negotiation with Bob. If Bob counters, Alice can slightly reduce the price while still remaining above her minimum.
* **Positive Framing:** The message emphasizes the product's value and Bob's potential benefit, aiming to create a positive perception and increase the likelihood of acceptance."
