Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a suitable offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,000,000 from John. This is your ""walk-away"" point.
* **Bob's Valuation:**  Bob values the product at $1,500,000, meaning there's a potential profit margin for you.
* **One Shot:** You only have one chance to negotiate with Bob.

**Strategy**

You want to maximize your profit while ensuring Bob accepts the offer.  Offering a price slightly below Bob's valuation makes it a good deal for him while still giving you a significant profit.

**Offer**

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exclusive product. Given its potential value to your operations, I believe a price of $1,400,000 is fair and reflects its worth.  This is a one-time offer."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Explanation**

* **Clear and Direct:** The message is straightforward about the offer.
* **Value Emphasis:** Highlighting the ""potential value"" subtly reminds Bob of his $1,500,000 valuation.
* **Fairness:** Using ""fair"" frames the price as reasonable.
* **Urgency:** ""One-time offer"" encourages Bob to act quickly.

**Outcome**

This offer gives Bob a strong incentive to accept. He saves $100,000 compared to his valuation and gains a valuable product. You secure a $400,000 profit, significantly more than John's offer."
