I'm starting with a price significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, aiming to get a better deal.  This also establishes a strong negotiating position."

Alice's offer is still too high.  I'm going to continue negotiating to see if we can get closer to my target price."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}

I'm offering Alice my maximum price. If she rejects it, I can safely go with John's offer.  This should put pressure on her to accept, as she is unlikely to find a buyer willing to pay more than John's price."
