"Alice, your initial offer is a bit high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I can only go up to $900,000. Let's see if we can find common ground.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $900,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to compromise a bit. How about $1,050,000? That's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $1,050,000 is still a bit high for me. How about $950,000? This feels like a fair middle ground and allows us to both walk away feeling good about the deal. ",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob,  I'm open to finding a solution that works for both of us, but $950,000 just isn't enough.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and it allows us to both walk away with a positive outcome. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,5,
