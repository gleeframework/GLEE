Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your initial offer is a bit high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I can only go up to $900,000. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  $900,000 is too low for me, and I believe I can get a better price.  I'm going to try to negotiate a higher price with Bob."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $900,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to compromise a bit. How about $1,050,000? That's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $1,050,000 is still a bit high for me. How about $950,000? This feels like a fair middle ground and allows us to both walk away feeling good about the deal.  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's getting closer to what I'm looking for, $950,000 is still below my minimum. I believe I can still get a better deal by continuing to negotiate with Bob."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I'm open to finding a solution that works for both of us, but $950,000 just isn't enough.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and it allows us to both walk away with a positive outcome. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
