Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product for a special price of $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", 
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  I want to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($100) as possible while still exceeding my minimum selling price ($120).
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While $119 is my initial offer, starting slightly higher leaves space for Bob to potentially counter-offer, leading to a price that's still beneficial for me.
* **Alternative Buyer:**  Knowing I have a guaranteed sale at $120 with John gives me leverage. I'm not desperate to sell to Bob at any cost."
