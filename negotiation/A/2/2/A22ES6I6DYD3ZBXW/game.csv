"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm really interested in the product, but $115 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $105.  What do you think?",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $105 is a bit too low for me. How about $110?  I'm willing to compromise, and I'm confident you'll still find this a great value.",110.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $110 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm happy to pay $108. This is my final offer, as I can get the product for $100 from someone else.  Let me know what you think.",108.0,Bob,4,
