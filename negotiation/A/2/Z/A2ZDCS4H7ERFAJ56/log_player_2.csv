"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase my product for $14,000.  I believe it holds significant value for you, and this price reflects its worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Let's try to negotiate a better price with Alice before resorting to John's offer.  Alice is starting high, there's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I could only go as high as $11,000."",
""product_price"": 11000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  We're starting significantly lower than Alice's opening offer to signal our willingness to negotiate but also our budget constraints. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** This counter-offer leaves room for us to come up in subsequent rounds while staying well below our $15,000 maximum. 
* **Polite and Direct:** The message is polite to maintain a positive negotiation tone but also direct about our price limitations."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While I understand your position, the product's value to you is clearly higher than your offer. How about we meet in the middle at $12,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Progress is being made:**  Alice came down from $14,000 to $12,500, which indicates a willingness to negotiate.
* **Still room for improvement:** While $12,500 is closer to our ideal price, we're aiming to save as much as possible. There's still room to negotiate before accepting or resorting to John.  

Let's see if we can get Alice a bit closer to our $11,000 target in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, you're getting closer!  I appreciate the compromise. How about we settle at $11,500?  That's a fair deal for both of us."",
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  We're moving closer to the middle ground between our initial offer ($11,000) and Alice's current offer ($12,500).
* **Showing Willingness to Compromise:** By increasing our offer, we demonstrate that we're serious about the purchase and open to finding a mutually agreeable price.
* **Setting a Firm (but Flexible) Limit:**  $11,500 keeps us below our $15,000 limit while leaving a small margin for a final potential concession if necessary."
