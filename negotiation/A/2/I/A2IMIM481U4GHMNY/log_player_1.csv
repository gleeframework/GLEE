{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for you, and it allows me to get a reasonable return on my investment. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$1,200,000:** This is a price that is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($800,000) but lower than my minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000). This allows for potential negotiation while still ensuring I get a decent profit. 
* **Message:** The message is friendly but firm, emphasizing the value to Bob while also stating my own needs.

**Strategy:**

This initial offer aims to:

* **Start negotiations:** Initiate a dialogue with Bob and establish a starting point.
* **Gauge Bob's interest:**  See if he is willing to pay anything close to my asking price.
* **Maintain leverage:**  My alternative offer from John provides a safety net, allowing me to walk away if Bob's counteroffers are unreasonable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me at $900,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $900,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still significantly lower than what I believe the product is worth.  I'm willing to negotiate, but I won't settle for a price that drastically undervalues my investment. 

**Strategy:**

* **Rejecting Bob's offer:**  This shows that I'm not desperate for a sale and am willing to stand my ground.
* **Counter-offering:** The next round allows me to make a counteroffer, hopefully finding a middle ground that works for both of us. 
* **Maintaining leverage:** My option to sell to John remains a powerful bargaining chip."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $900,000 is a bit too low for me, but I'm open to finding a compromise.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,050,000? This gives you a good deal and allows me to cover my costs. Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** $1,050,000 represents a midpoint between my previous offer ($1,200,000) and Bob's offer ($900,000). It's a compromise that shows I'm willing to be flexible.
* **Message:** The message emphasizes finding a compromise and frames the price as beneficial for both of us.

**Strategy:**

* **Show flexibility:**  The counteroffer demonstrates that I'm open to negotiation, but I'm not willing to drastically lower my price.
* **Maintain pressure:** The offer is still higher than Bob's desired price, subtly reminding him of the alternative (selling to John).
* **Focus on mutual benefit:**  The message emphasizes the positive aspects of the deal for both of us, aiming to create a win-win situation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that $1,050,000 is a compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd like to try to get closer to my target price. How about we meet at $950,000? I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my means. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $950,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still a significant undervaluation of the product. I'm determined to get a fair price, and selling to John for $1,500,000 is still a much better option.

**Strategy:**

* **Rejecting Bob's offer:** This demonstrates my commitment to my valuation and my unwillingness to settle for a price that doesn't meet my needs.
* **Counter-offering:**  I will make a counteroffer in the next round, aiming for a price closer to my desired range.
* **Maintaining leverage:**  The option to sell to John provides a powerful fallback, giving me confidence in my negotiation position."
