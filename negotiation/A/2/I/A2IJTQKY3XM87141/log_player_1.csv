"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price above Bob's perceived value, but significantly lower than my minimum. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Positive Tone:**  A friendly message helps build rapport and encourages Bob to consider the offer.
* **Value Proposition:**  Highlighting the value of the product for Bob can sway his decision.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob rejects, I'll assess his counteroffer and consider if it's worth further negotiation or if I should move on to John. 
* If Bob accepts, I've secured a decent profit, but I'll still be mindful of the potential to get a better price in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:** Bob's offer of $9,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Potential for Better Deal:** While Bob is interested, his current offer is not profitable enough. I believe there's potential to negotiate a higher price in future rounds.
* **John as Backup:**  Having John as a potential buyer at $15,000 provides a safety net if negotiations with Bob fail. 

**Next Steps:**

* I'll counter Bob's offer with a price closer to my minimum, aiming to find a compromise that benefits both of us. 
* I'll be careful to avoid rejecting Bob's offer too many times, as it could risk him walking away and me missing out on a deal altogether."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This is still a great deal considering the value you'll get from the product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offering:** I'm rejecting Bob's offer, but I'm showing flexibility by counter-offering.
* **Compromise:**  My counteroffer of $11,000 is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway between his offer and my previous offer.
* **Value Emphasis:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to encourage him to consider my offer.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob rejects this offer, I'll need to carefully consider his next counteroffer. 
* I'm still aiming for a price closer to my minimum, but I'm willing to negotiate to secure a deal. 
* I'll be mindful of the number of rounds remaining and my fallback option with John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:**  While Bob is getting closer to my minimum, $10,000 is still below what I'm comfortable with.
* **Potential for Better Deal:** With four rounds left, I believe there's still room to negotiate a higher price.  I want to avoid settling for a price that's too low. 
* **John as Backup:** Knowing I can sell to John for $15,000 gives me the confidence to hold out for a better deal. 

**Next Steps:**

* I'll counter Bob's offer with a price slightly higher than his last offer, aiming to find a compromise in the next round. 
* I'll continue to emphasize the value of the product and try to understand Bob's motivations.
*  I'll be strategic about my counteroffers, keeping in mind the limited number of rounds remaining."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to come up on your offer.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,500?  This is a fair price considering the value you'll gain from the product.  Let's try to close this deal."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** My counteroffer is a compromise, splitting the difference between Bob's offer of $10,000 and my previous offer of $11,000.
* **Urgency:**  I'm adding a sense of urgency by suggesting that we close the deal. This can encourage Bob to accept the offer rather than risk further negotiation.
* **Value Reminder:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's worth to reinforce the value proposition.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, I've secured a good deal with a decent profit.
* If Bob rejects, I'll need to carefully assess his counteroffer.  I'll need to consider how much I'm willing to compromise and how many rounds are left. 
* I'll continue to leverage the option of selling to John to maintain leverage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product. Can you consider my offer?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:** Bob's offer of $9,500 is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Potential for Better Deal:** With four rounds left, I believe there's still room to negotiate a higher price. I don't want to settle for a price that is too low, especially since I have a backup buyer in John.
* **John as Backup:**  Having John as a potential buyer at $15,000 gives me the leverage to hold out for a better deal.

**Next Steps:**

* I'll counter Bob's offer with a price slightly higher than his last offer, aiming to find a compromise in the next round.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand you're sticking to your price point, but $9,500 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,000 as a final offer. This is a fair price considering the product's value. Let's make this deal happen. "", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** By stating it's my ""final offer,"" I'm creating a sense of urgency and a potential end point for negotiations.  
* **Slight Compromise:** My offer of $10,000 is a slight compromise from my previous offer, showing I'm still open to negotiation. 
* **Value Focus:** I'm reiterating the product's value to remind Bob of the potential gain.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, I've secured a price closer to my target while closing the deal.
* If Bob rejects, I'll need to seriously consider my options. 
    * Do I risk another round with Bob and potentially lose him as a buyer altogether?
    * Or do I accept John's offer and secure a guaranteed $15,000? 
    *  The decision will depend on my risk tolerance and my assessment of the likelihood of Bob agreeing to a higher price in the remaining rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down to $10,000, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product. This is my final offer. Can you consider it? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:** Bob's offer of $9,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Limited Time:** We are in the 8th round, and with only two rounds left, the potential of getting a higher price from Bob is low.
* **Guaranteed Profit:**  Selling to John for $15,000 guarantees a significant profit and secures a sale.

**Next Steps:**

* I'm choosing to walk away from the negotiation with Bob and sell to John. While it's not my ideal price, it's the most sensible decision given the limited time and potential for further price concessions from Bob."
