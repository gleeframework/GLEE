Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 115} 
```

This offer is a good starting point. It's higher than your minimum, leaving room for negotiation, but still lower than Bob's perceived value. This gives Bob an incentive to negotiate, but also shows you're serious about getting a good price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is closer to your minimum, but you can likely get a better price. You'll counteroffer to try and get closer to your desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 112} 
```

This counteroffer is a compromise, showing flexibility while still aiming for a higher price than Bob's offer. It leaves room for further negotiation if necessary."
