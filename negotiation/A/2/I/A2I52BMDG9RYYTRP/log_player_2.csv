"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product.  It's valued at over $1.5 million to me, but I'm willing to start the conversation at $1,400,000.  This is a significant opportunity for you, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but that price is a bit high for me. How about we bring it down to $1,100,000? I think that's a fair starting point for negotiations."", ""product_price"": 1100000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and I'm willing to work with you. However, $1,100,000 is simply too low for me.  Let's compromise.  I'm willing to drop the price to $1,300,000.  This is still a significant discount from my true value and a fantastic deal for you.  Let's get this done. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  While $1,300,000 is closer, it's still a touch outside my budget.  To be fair to both of us, how about we settle at $1,150,000?  That feels like a good compromise."", ""product_price"": 1150000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,150,000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1,250,000.  This is a fair price for both of us.  Let's finalize this deal and avoid any further delays. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

Explanation: While Alice is coming down, it's clear she's aiming for a price higher than John's offer.  It's unlikely she'll go below $1,200,000 in the remaining rounds.  Cutting your losses and buying from John guarantees you get the product within your budget."
