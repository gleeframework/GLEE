"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a unique opportunity to get your hands on something truly special. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12000. This is a great deal, considering its value to you is $10000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you considering my budget. However, $12000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $10500 for the product. This is my best offer, considering I can get it elsewhere for $10000.  Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $10500 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $11500. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and my initial offer. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet me halfway. However, $11500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $11000, which is a fair compromise considering your initial offer and my ability to purchase elsewhere.  Let me know if you're open to this final offer.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a compromise, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go below $12000. This is the minimum price I'm willing to accept for the product, considering its value to me. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm open to negotiating further. Otherwise, I'll have to consider other options.",12000.0,Alice,5,
