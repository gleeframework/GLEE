"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a unique opportunity to get your hands on something truly special. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12000. This is a great deal, considering its value to you is $10000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject the offer. He can get the product for $10,000 from John, so there's no reason to pay more. By rejecting, he can attempt to negotiate a lower price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you considering my budget. However, $12,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product. This is my best offer, considering I can get it elsewhere for $10,000.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $10500 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $11500. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and my initial offer. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $11,500 is closer to his budget, he can still get the product for $10,000 from John.  He should continue to negotiate with Alice to see if he can get a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a compromise, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go below $12000. This is the minimum price I'm willing to accept for the product, considering its value to me. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm open to negotiating further. Otherwise, I'll have to consider other options.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has stated that her minimum price is $12,000, which is above Bob's budget.  Since he can get the product for $10,000 from John, it's in his best interest to stop negotiating with Alice and buy the product from John.  Continuing to negotiate with Alice would likely lead to a stalemate, wasting time and potentially increasing the final price."
