Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $90 is a bit steep for you, but I still think the product is worth a premium. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $82. It's a fair compromise that still reflects its value to you.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're sticking to your offer of $75, but I'm still not comfortable selling it that low. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $79. It's a compromise that I think is fair, considering the value the product will bring to you.
