Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,450,000.  I believe this is a fair offer considering its worth. Let me know your thoughts."", 
""product_price"": 1450000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, your goal is to see if Bob will pay even more.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product slightly below your guaranteed price creates a sense of urgency and potential deal for Bob.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While the offer is high, it leaves a small margin for Bob to potentially counter-offer if he's very interested, allowing you to potentially earn even more."
