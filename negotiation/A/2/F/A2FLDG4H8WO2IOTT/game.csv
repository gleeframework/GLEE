"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $120 is a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $85 for the product.  What do you think?",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $120 is a bit steep for you, but $85 is also a bit low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $105?",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $105 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $95.  Let's see if we can find some common ground there.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close, but I still need to make a profit. How about we compromise at $110? It's a bit higher than your last offer, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle again.",110.0,Alice,5,
