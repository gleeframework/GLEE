Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. It's incredibly valuable and I know you'll benefit greatly from it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000.  I believe this is a fair price that reflects its true worth."",
""product_price"": 950000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as much money from Bob as possible, knowing John is a guaranteed sale at $1,000,000.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high but below John's offer ($950,000) allows for potential negotiation if Bob counter-offers. 
* **Highlight Value:** The message emphasizes the product's value to Bob, potentially making him more amenable to a higher price.

**Important Note:** This is a single-round negotiation strategy. In a real-world scenario,  Alice could adapt her approach based on Bob's response and potential counter-offers."
