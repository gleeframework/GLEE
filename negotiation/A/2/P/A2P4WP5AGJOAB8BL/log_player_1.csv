Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering a product that I believe you'll find valuable. I'm asking for $150. Let me know if you're interested."", 
""product_price"": 150
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $100, you should aim higher with Bob to maximize your potential profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $150 leaves space for Bob to negotiate down, potentially meeting somewhere in the middle that's still above your minimum. 
* **Gauge Bob's Interest:** A higher initial offer helps you gauge how interested Bob truly is. If he accepts immediately, you know you could have gone even higher! If he rejects, you can always negotiate down closer to John's price."
