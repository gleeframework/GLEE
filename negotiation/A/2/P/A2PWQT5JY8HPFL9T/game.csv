"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, the price point is a little high for me. I'd be willing to purchase it for $1,050,000.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1,050,000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,300,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you and the value I place on it. Let me know if this is something you're interested in.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $1,300,000 is still a bit too high for my budget.  Would you consider $1,150,000?",1150000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I understand that $1,150,000 is still a bit lower than my target price. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,250,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the value I place on it. Let me know if this is something you're interested in.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
