"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,150,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the value to both of us. Let's see if we can make this work.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $1,100,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,075,000, which is a fair compromise. This is a significant amount of money, and I believe it's a deal we can both be happy with. What do you say?",1075000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,075,000 is still a bit below what I need. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,087,500.  This price is fair, considering the value you'll get from the product. Let's close this deal!",1087500.0,Alice,5,
