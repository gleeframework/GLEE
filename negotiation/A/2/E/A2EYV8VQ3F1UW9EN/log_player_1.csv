Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $200. I think it's a great deal for something of this quality. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 200}
```

Here's the reasoning behind this offer:

* **Starting High:** It's always best to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for bargaining and makes you seem more flexible if you lower the price.
* **Above Bob's Value:** While Bob values the product at $150,  he might be willing to pay a bit more if he perceives the product as valuable or scarce.  
* **Protecting Your Interest:** If Bob rejects the offer, you can always sell to John for your minimum acceptable price.

This strategy aims to maximize your potential profit while still offering Bob a chance to buy the product."
