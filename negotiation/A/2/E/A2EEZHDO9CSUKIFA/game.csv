"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I'm looking to save as much as I can. I'm willing to pay $800,000 for the product. I think it's a fair price considering its value to you is $1,000,000. Let me know if you're willing to consider my offer.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 is too low for me. However, I'm willing to be flexible. Let's meet in the middle. I'm offering the product for $950,000. This price still gives you a good deal, and it's closer to the value I need to achieve.  What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Alice, but $950,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $850,000, but that's as high as I can go. I think this price is a fair compromise considering the value you're placing on the product. Let me know if you're willing to consider my offer.",850000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $850,000 is closer, it's still not quite what I need to make this deal work for me. I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This price reflects the value of the product and allows both of us to walk away with a good outcome. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",900000.0,Alice,5,
