This offer sets a high starting point, giving you room to negotiate while still securing a profit. It also opens the communication with a friendly tone, encouraging Bob to engage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I'm looking to save as much as I can. I'm willing to pay $800,000 for the product. I think it's a fair price considering its value to you is $1,000,000. Let me know if you're willing to consider my offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my desired price, and while it's tempting to close the deal, I can likely secure a higher price by continuing negotiations."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 is too low for me. However, I'm willing to be flexible. Let's meet in the middle. I'm offering the product for $950,000. This price still gives you a good deal, and it's closer to the value I need to achieve.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, Alice, but $950,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $850,000, but that's as high as I can go. I think this price is a fair compromise considering the value you're placing on the product. Let me know if you're willing to consider my offer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $850,000 is closer to my desired price than Bob's previous offer, it's still below my target. I believe I can get a better deal by continuing the negotiations. I'm not yet willing to settle for a price that's below my minimum threshold."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $850,000 is closer, it's still not quite what I need to make this deal work for me. I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This price reflects the value of the product and allows both of us to walk away with a good outcome. Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, Alice, but $900,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $875,000, but that's as high as I can go. I think this price is a fair compromise considering the value you're placing on the product. Let me know if you're willing to consider my offer.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price, and I've already made multiple concessions.  Rather than continue negotiating and potentially risk getting a lower price, it's wiser to accept John's offer, guaranteeing me $1,000,000 for the product."
