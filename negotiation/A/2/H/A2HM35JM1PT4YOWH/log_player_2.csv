"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you today. I think it would be incredibly valuable for you, and I'm happy to answer any questions you might have. I'm asking for $20,000 for it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for offering this product. While I agree it could be useful, $20,000 is a bit outside my budget. Would you consider $10,000?"", ""product_price"": 10000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is quite a bit lower than I'm hoping to get for this product. Could you do $17,000? I'm willing to be flexible if we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you're looking for a higher price, but $17,000 is still too high for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $12,000?"", ""product_price"": 12000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your willingness to negotiate. $12,000 is still a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference again and settle at $14,500? This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** While Alice is showing some flexibility, her ""final offer"" of $14,500 is still significantly higher than John's offer of $8,000. There's no point in continuing the negotiation with Alice if I can get a much better deal elsewhere."
