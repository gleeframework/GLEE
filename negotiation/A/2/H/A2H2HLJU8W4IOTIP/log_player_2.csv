Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Bob, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,680,000.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,680,000 is still above my target budget of $1,500,000.  We have gone through 5 rounds of negotiation, and it seems like we are not getting closer to a deal.  It's better to cut my losses and buy the product from John for $1,500,000.  This guarantees I get the product at my target price and avoids further negotiation."
