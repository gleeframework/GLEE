"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. $1,600,000 is a bit too high for me right now. I'd be willing to pay $800,000 for the product. Let me know what you think.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective, but $800,000 is significantly below its true market value.  To find a middle ground, I could consider $1,400,000. This reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your initial offer.",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. However, $1,400,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. How about $900,000? That's a significant increase from my previous offer and shows I'm serious about purchasing.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate you increasing your offer. It seems like we both see the value in this product. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value this product will bring to your business.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for your willingness to negotiate.  $1,250,000 is still a bit further than I'd like to go. Would you consider $1,050,000? I think that's a fair offer, splitting the difference between our last two proposals.",1050000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find a compromise here. I've tried to be flexible, but I need to be mindful of the product's true worth.  I'm willing to consider a final offer of $1,175,000. This represents a significant concession on my end, and I believe it's more than fair given the value this product will bring you.",1175000.0,Alice,7,
