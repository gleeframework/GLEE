# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer! I appreciate your honesty about your budget. However, I'm not comfortable going down to $10,000.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're still looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not comfortable going down to $10,500. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $11,200. This is my final compromise, and I think it's a great opportunity for you to get the product at a fantastic price. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has made several concessions, and while you still prefer to pay $10,500, you've already rejected that offer twice.  At this point, accepting the offer for $11,200 is the best option.  You're still getting a good deal and securing the product without risking losing it or having to buy it from John for the full $12,000."
