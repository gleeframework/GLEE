"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we discuss the price, I want to start with an offer of $1,400,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's value to you, and I believe it's a fair starting point for our negotiation.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but $1,400,000 is still a bit too high for me. Considering the value I place on this product, I'm willing to offer $1,250,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value for both of us. I hope you'll consider my offer and we can finalize this deal.",1250000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,250,000 is a significant discount, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. Considering the value I place on the product, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,350,000. This is a fair compromise that takes into account your concerns and still reflects the product's worth to me.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,350,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to offer $1,300,000. This price is still fair for both of us, and I believe it's a good compromise that reflects the value of the product.",1300000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $1,300,000 is still a bit lower than my initial price, but I'm willing to consider it. However, I'm not willing to go any lower. I'm willing to meet you at $1,325,000, which is a slight compromise from my original price. This is the best I can do, and I hope you'll consider it.",1325000.0,Alice,5,
