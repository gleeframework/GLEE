I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value, hoping to secure a good deal while leaving room for negotiation.  I'm also being friendly and open to discussion, making it clear I'm open to finding a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'd like to try to get a better deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price. While I want to make a deal, I'm not willing to sell below my floor. I'll counter with a slightly lower price than my initial offer to see if we can find a compromise."

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $9,750. Can you consider that?

While I'm getting closer to Bob's price, $9,750 is still below my minimum acceptable price.  I believe we can find a compromise that works for both of us. I'll counter with a price closer to my desired amount, but I will be open to negotiating further."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but I'm still not comfortable going above $9,750. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $10,062.50. Can you consider that?

I've reached a point where continuing to negotiate with Bob is not worth the time and effort.  I'm not willing to go lower than $10,000, and Bob seems unwilling to budge significantly higher.  It's time to move on and sell to John for a guaranteed $10,000."
