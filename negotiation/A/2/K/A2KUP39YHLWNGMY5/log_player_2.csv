"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this excellent product.  I think it would be a valuable asset to you. I'm asking for $18,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject the offer. $18,000 is way over his budget and he can get the product for $10,000 from John.  It makes sense to try to negotiate with Alice first, but he shouldn't be afraid to walk away if she doesn't come down in price significantly."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, that price is a bit too high for me. I'm really interested in the product, but my budget is only $10,000.  Would you be willing to consider that price?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $18,000 is already a very competitive price for a product of this quality.  How about we meet in the middle at $14,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should still reject Alice's offer. While it's a better price than her initial offer, it's still above his budget. He can still get the product for $10,000 from John, so there's no need to settle for a higher price. He should continue negotiating with Alice, hoping she will lower her price further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $14,000 is still outside my budget. I'm really serious about buying this product, but I can only afford $11,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm glad you're serious about the product. It's clear how valuable it would be for you.  How about $12,500?  That's my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy from John.  While Alice has come down significantly, it is still above his ideal budget.  At this point, it's likely that Alice is not going to budge much further, and he is running out of time. John is offering the product for the price Bob is willing to pay, and it's worth taking the deal to avoid further negotiation and potential disappointment."
