"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not willing to go above that. Can you consider my counteroffer?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but $10,000 is quite a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. How about we meet closer to the middle at $13,500? This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the true value of the product.",13500.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your perspective, Alice, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I think $12,500 is a more reasonable compromise. Can you consider my revised offer?",12500.0,Bob,4,
