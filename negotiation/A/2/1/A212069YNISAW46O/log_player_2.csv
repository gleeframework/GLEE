"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this incredible product. It's truly one-of-a-kind and I know you'll be thrilled with its value. I'm initially offering it to you for $1,000,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

This is a clear case of starting the negotiation.  Alice's offer is way above your budget, so you should reject and counter-offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate the value of the product, $1,000,000 is significantly above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850,000, which is a fair price considering my needs and the market value. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is still significantly below what I'm willing to accept. This product offers exceptional value, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $975,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that reflects the true value of this product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice's offer is still too high, even after her slight reduction. It's worth continuing the negotiation to see if we can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you believe in the value of the product, but $975,000 is still a stretch for me.  I'm willing to go up to $900,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. This demonstrates my serious interest, and I hope it's a price we can both be happy with."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. $900,000 is close, but I'm still looking for a bit more. How about $950,000? This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges the true value of this product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $950,000 is closer to my budget, it's still more than I want to pay. There's still room to negotiate, and I'm not ready to give in just yet.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm getting closer to your desired price, but $950,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $925,000. This represents a significant increase from my previous offer, and I truly believe it's a fair compromise.  Let's find a way to finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 925000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, you're getting very close. I can tell you're serious about this, so I'm willing to come down to my final offer of $937,500. This is a significant reduction on my part, and I believe it's more than fair considering the value you'll be receiving. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $937,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $937,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's final offer is still above my preferred price point.  While we are getting closer, I've already spent a few rounds negotiating.  It's time to cut my losses and buy from John.  He's offering the product at a price within my budget, and I don't want to risk going further with Alice and getting stuck with a higher price."
