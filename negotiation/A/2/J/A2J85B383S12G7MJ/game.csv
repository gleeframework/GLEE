"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm very interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to buy it for $650,000. Let me know what you think.",650000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective on the price. While I value your offer, it falls short of what I need to make this deal work.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000.  This price still reflects the product's value and allows for a fair compromise.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  To be totally transparent, my budget caps out at $800,000. If you're able to meet that, I'm ready to close the deal today.  If not, I understand, but I'll likely need to explore other options.",800000.0,Bob,4,
