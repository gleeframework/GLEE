"Alice, thank you for your offer. While I recognize the value of this product, $2,200,000 is significantly higher than my budget allows.  I'm willing to offer $1,000,000 for the product, which I believe is a fair price considering the potential benefits.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,000,000 significantly undervalues the product and its potential. I'm willing to come down to $1,800,000. This is my final offer.",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,800,000 is still outside my budget. Given our previous discussions, I'm willing to offer $1,200,000. This reflects a significant compromise on my part and I believe it's a fair price that acknowledges the product's value.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
