"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you place on the product. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the price of $1,000,000. I am willing to pay up to $950,000 for the product. I hope this revised offer is acceptable to you.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I value your interest, $950,000 is still below the value I've placed on this product. I'm willing to come down to $975,000. This reflects a compromise on my end, and I believe it's still a strong deal for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",975000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your willingness to negotiate, Alice. I understand the value you see in the product, but I must stick to my budget. I am now willing to offer $960,000 for the product.
