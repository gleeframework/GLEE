"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $14,000, which is a significant discount from my minimum value but still leaves some room for negotiation. This should incentivize Bob to engage while also demonstrating that I'm serious about selling."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $12,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum value. I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob in hopes of reaching a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to $13,000, demonstrating flexibility while still remaining above Bob's offer. This shows him that I'm willing to compromise but also that I value the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $11,000 is getting closer to Bob's perceived value, it's still below my minimum. I'm still holding out hope for a better deal and will continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500}
```

I'm making another small concession, dropping the price to $12,500. This shows Bob that I'm serious about making a deal and willing to compromise, but I'm also pushing him closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

With only 4 rounds left, the negotiations are getting increasingly difficult. Bob's offer of $10,500 is still below my minimum value. While I could continue negotiating, it's becoming increasingly risky to spend valuable rounds when I have a guaranteed sale to John for $15,000."
