"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $600,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $600,000 is simply too low. It doesn't reflect the value this product holds for you. How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This is a significant concession, and I'm confident it's a good deal for both of us.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $900,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $700,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",700000.0,Bob,4,
