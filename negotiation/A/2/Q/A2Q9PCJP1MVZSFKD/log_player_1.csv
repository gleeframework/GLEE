Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $750,000 is a decent amount, I'm hoping to get closer to my desired price.  I'll see if I can negotiate a better deal with Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000.  It's still a fair price for both of us, and I think it's a good starting point to reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my price.  However, $850,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to offer $825,000.  This is a very fair price, considering your minimum is $800,000 and my maximum is $800,000. Let's get this deal done. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $825,000 is very close to my minimum price of $800,000. It's a good deal for me, and I don't want to risk losing it by continuing to negotiate."
