Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $18,000 is significantly more than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for it, which is still a fair price considering its value.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
