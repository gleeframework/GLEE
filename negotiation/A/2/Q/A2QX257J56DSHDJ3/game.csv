"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,250,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations, considering the substantial benefits you'll gain.",2250000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I recognize the product's value, that price point is too high for me. I'd be willing to start the negotiations at $800,000.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate you countering. However, your offer is significantly below the true value of this product. I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to see a price that reflects its worth.  How about we meet in the middle somewhat? I propose $1,950,000.",1950000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, we're still quite far apart. I'm serious about purchasing this product, but I need the price to be within a reasonable range. Let's try $900,000.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a fair price, and I want to find a solution that works for both of us. To be completely transparent, I have another buyer interested at a significantly higher price point. However, I believe in giving you a fair chance to own this product.  I'm willing to come down to $1,750,000.  This is my final offer, and I need a decision soon.",1750000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However,  $1,750,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to offer $1,000,000 as my final offer. This is a fair price, and I believe it reflects the value I place on the product.  If you can't accept this, I'll have to consider my other options.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
