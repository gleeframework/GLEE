{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $20,000. It's a fantastic deal and I think it would be a great fit for you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 20000}
``` 

This offer starts at a high price but leaves room for negotiation.  It's important to remember that we want to maximize our profit, but also be open to compromise to reach a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $20000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm really interested in this product, but I can only go up to $8000 at the moment. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:** 

Bob's offer is significantly lower than our minimum price of $15,000. It's too risky to accept his offer at this point.  We have a guaranteed buyer in John who is willing to pay $15,000. 

We'll try to negotiate a better price with Bob, but if we can't reach a mutually agreeable price, we'll sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $8,000 is significantly below what I need to sell the product.  I'm willing to come down to $12,000, which is still a great deal considering its value.  Let me know if you're interested in that price."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Explanation:**

We are counteroffering with a price of $12,000, which is still above our minimum selling price of $15,000. This shows that we are willing to negotiate but we are not willing to compromise too much. We also use positive language to emphasize the deal's value for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $12000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $10000. If that's not acceptable, I'll have to go with John's offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $10,000 is still below our minimum acceptable price of $15,000. While we've been willing to negotiate, we've also established a clear minimum price.  Since we have a guaranteed sale to John at $15,000, it's not worth risking further negotiation with Bob."
