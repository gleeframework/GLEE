"Alice, $20000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm really interested in this product, but I can only go up to $8000 at the moment. What do you think?",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $8000 is significantly below what I need to sell the product.  I'm willing to come down to $12000, which is still a great deal considering its value.  Let me know if you're interested in that price.",12000.0,Alice,3,
