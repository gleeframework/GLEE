"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a great deal, as you know it's worth $1,000,000 to you, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $950,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have to be mindful of my budget.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but I need to stay closer to $1,000,000.  How about we meet in the middle at $975,000? That's a fair price for both of us and I'm confident you'll still find this a great deal.",975000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit shy of my target price. How about we meet at $925,000? I'm confident that's a fair price for both of us.",925000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $925,000 just isn't going to work for me.  How about we compromise at $950,000?  It's a fair price for both of us, and we can finally close this deal.",950000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand you're trying to get to $950,000, but I'm still a bit hesitant. How about we meet at $915,000? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget.",915000.0,Bob,6,
