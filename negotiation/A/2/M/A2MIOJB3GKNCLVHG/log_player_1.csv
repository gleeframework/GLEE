Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1700000} 

I'm starting high, knowing the product is worth more to me than Bob. This leaves room for negotiation, while still aiming for a good profit.  Let's see if he bites!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum than my initial offer, but it's still below my floor. I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can meet in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

I'm lowering my price to $1,600,000, which is closer to Bob's offer. This shows good faith while still ensuring a profit above my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my original asking price, Bob's latest offer is too low.  I'm going to sell to John. The guaranteed $1,500,000 is a better outcome than risking a further decline in price."
