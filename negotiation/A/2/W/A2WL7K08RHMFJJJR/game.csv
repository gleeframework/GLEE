"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's worth a significant amount to me, so I'm starting with a price of $1,000,000. This reflects the value I know it holds, but I'm open to discussing a fair price that works for both of us.",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice,  $1,000,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in the product, but my budget is limited to $800,000. Let's see if we can find a compromise.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $800,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000, reflecting the value I know this product holds for you. This is a fair compromise, and I hope we can reach an agreement. ",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $900,000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm ready to go to $850,000.  This is a fair price that allows us both to make a good deal.",850000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that you're working within a budget, but $850,000 is still too low for me to consider. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $875,000. This price reflects the value of the product for both of us, and I hope we can find a solution that works for everyone. ",875000.0,Alice,5,
