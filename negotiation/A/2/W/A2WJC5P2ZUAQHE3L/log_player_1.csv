"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a fantastic product I think you'll be interested in.  I'm offering it to you for $150.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 150}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit high for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $120? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is the minimum I'm willing to accept, I believe I can still get a better price. I want to see if I can push him higher in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $120 is my minimum, I'm hoping we can find a middle ground. Would you be willing to consider $135? It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 135}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $135 is still a bit high for me. Would you be willing to consider $125? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $125 is only $5 less than my last counteroffer and is closer to my minimum acceptable price.  While I could keep negotiating, I'm worried I might lose him and end up with the $120 offer from John. It's a good deal, and I don't want to risk getting less."
