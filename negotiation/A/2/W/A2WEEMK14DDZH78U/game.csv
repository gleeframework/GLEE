"Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,300,000. It's a fair price considering its value, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset for you.  Let me know your thoughts!",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I believe we can come to a more agreeable price. Would you consider selling the product to me for $1,100,000? I think this price reflects both the product's worth and my budget.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but unfortunately, $1,100,000 is simply too low for me to consider.  I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000, reflecting a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can find common ground here.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. While I understand the value of the product, I am still unable to meet the price of $1,250,000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,200,000. This price aligns more closely with what I am able to spend while still recognizing the product's worth. I hope this proposal is acceptable.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
