"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you're willing to negotiate.  While I see the value in your product, $1,150,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for the offer and your perspective. I understand your position, but I'm confident this product will yield significant returns for you. How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000? This reflects the true value of the product and ensures a win-win scenario for both of us.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm ready to close the deal at $1,075,000. It's a fair price that considers both our positions.  What do you say?",1075000.0,Bob,4,
