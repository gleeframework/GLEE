"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you this incredible product for $2,000,000.  It's a steal considering its true value.  Let's make a deal!"", ""product_price"": 2000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High initial offer:**  Starting high sets the tone for the negotiation and allows for room to come down. 
* **Emphasis on value:** Highlighting the ""true value"" of the product adds to the perceived benefit for Bob. 
* **Positive tone:** A friendly and enthusiastic approach can make Bob more open to negotiation. 

This strategy aims to maximize profit while leaving space for potential counteroffers and compromise in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the asking price of $2000000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1200000 for your product. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price.** I'm not willing to sell for less than $1,500,000.
* **There are still rounds left.** I can try to negotiate a better price with Bob, or sell to John if I'm not satisfied with the progress.
* **Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation open.**  This allows me to try to get closer to my desired price in the following rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me. However, I'm willing to be flexible.  How about $1,700,000? That's a significant discount from my initial price and still allows you to get a great deal on this valuable product."", ""product_price"": 1700000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a lower price:**  This shows I'm willing to compromise but still maintain a price above my minimum.
* **Emphasis on value:**  Reiterating the ""great deal"" aspect helps Bob see the benefit.
* **Moderate price drop:**  The $300,000 decrease is a significant concession but still leaves room for further negotiation. 

This strategy aims to move the negotiation closer to my desired price while keeping the conversation open for future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. While I understand the value of the product is higher than what I'm willing to pay, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1500000. I believe this is a fair compromise that respects both our interests. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer meets my minimum acceptable price.**  I'm not willing to sell for less than $1,500,000.
* **Accepting this offer secures the sale and avoids the risk of further negotiation.**  While I could potentially get a higher price with more rounds, there's no guarantee of success. 
* **Time is a factor.**  The longer the negotiation drags on, the higher the chance of another buyer emerging or Bob changing his mind.

This decision maximizes my potential profit while minimizing risk and ensuring a quick sale."
