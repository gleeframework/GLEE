Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. This is a fantastic deal considering its worth in the current market. Let me know your decision soon, as I have other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($800,000) as possible without going below our minimum ($1,200,000).
* **Strong Opening:** Starting with a strong offer ($1,100,000) leaves room for negotiation if Bob counters. It also signals the product's value.
* **Alternative Buyer:**  Mentioning ""other interested parties"" reminds Bob we have a backup plan (John) ensuring we don't lose the sale entirely. 
* **Time Pressure (Slight):**  The phrase ""Let me know your decision soon"" creates a subtle sense of urgency, potentially pushing Bob towards a quicker decision.

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes we have limited information about Bob's negotiation style and risk tolerance.  More sophisticated strategies might involve gathering additional intel before making an offer."
