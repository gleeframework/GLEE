"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's something that I'm confident will be worth every penny to you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This represents a significant saving for you compared to its true value. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While the offer of $12,000 is higher than Alice's valuation, it's significantly lower than your maximum price of $15,000 and the alternative offer from John. Accepting this offer saves you $3,000."
