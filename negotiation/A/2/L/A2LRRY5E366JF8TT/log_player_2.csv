# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I believe it's a game-changer and I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your offer of $700,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $825,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you is $800,000, and I think it's a great compromise. Let me know what you think.

Alice is very close to your maximum but is unlikely to go any lower. It makes more sense to buy from John for $800,000 and avoid further negotiation rounds."
