{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500.  It's a great deal for both of us!  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value ($8,000). This gives me room to negotiate and still potentially achieve a better outcome than selling to John.
* **Showing Flexibility:** I'm also including a positive message to encourage Bob to engage and signal that I'm open to negotiation. 

This approach allows me to gauge Bob's interest while keeping a good margin for myself. If he rejects, I can adjust my counteroffer based on his response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice,  $9500 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $8500 for your product.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum ($10,000), it's still significantly lower than what I'd like to get. I believe I can get a better price by continuing negotiations. 

**Next Steps:**

I'll counteroffer Bob with a price closer to $9,000. This shows I'm willing to compromise but also that I value the product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is a little low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,000?  That's a fair price that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm offering a price that's closer to Bob's offer, but still significantly higher than his initial $8,500. This demonstrates my willingness to negotiate.
* **Positive Framing:** My message emphasizes the fairness of the offer and highlights the mutual benefit. 
* **Maintaining Value:**  $9,000 is still closer to my ideal selling price, and I'm hopeful that Bob will see this as a reasonable compromise. 

By sticking to a price closer to my desired range, I hope to get Bob to agree without having to drop too far."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm still not comfortable with $9000.  How about we split the difference and go with $8750?  That's a good compromise for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $8,750 is getting very close to my minimum acceptable price.  While I'd prefer to get closer to $9,000, I need to balance the risk of continuing negotiations against the potential to lose Bob as a buyer entirely.  

Here's why I'm accepting:

* **Closing the Deal:**  $8,750 is a reasonable compromise. 
* **Risk of Delay:**  Continuing negotiations could drag on and potentially lead to Bob losing interest or finding another seller.
* **John's Offer:** While John offers $10,000, there's no guarantee he'll remain interested if I keep rejecting Bob's offers. 

Accepting Bob's offer ensures a sale and a decent profit, mitigating the risk of a failed negotiation or a lost opportunity."
