"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $170 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider selling it for $120?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $170 is a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we try $155? It's still a great deal for the product, and I think you'll find it's worth the investment.",155.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice. However, $155 is still a bit more than I'm looking to spend. Would you be willing to settle for $130?",130.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $130 is still a bit lower than I'd like, but I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $142? It's a fair price for the product, and I think you'll find it's worth the investment.",142.0,Alice,5,

"I'm getting close to accepting your offer, Bob. However, I'd like to make one more push to get closer to my minimum price. How about we meet at $140? It's a fair compromise, and I think you'll find it's still a great deal.",140.0,Alice,7,
