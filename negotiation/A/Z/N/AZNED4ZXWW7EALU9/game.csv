"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,300,000 is a bit steep for me. Given the product's value to me and considering the potential for a mutually beneficial agreement, I'm willing to offer $1,000,000. This would allow you a healthy profit and ensure a swift transaction.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your understanding of the product's value. While your offer is reasonable, I believe a price closer to my initial offer better reflects its true worth. I'm willing to come down to $1,175,000. This allows for both of us to benefit significantly from the transaction.",1175000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,175,000 is still outside my budget. Let's split the difference - I'm willing to pay $1,087,500. This would be a fair compromise for both of us.",1087500.0,Bob,4,
