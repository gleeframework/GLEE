"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm confident you'll find my asking price of $1,300,000 to be fair.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than her value of $800,000. This means there is room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a better price."

Given the product's value to me and considering the potential for a mutually beneficial agreement, I'm willing to offer $1,000,000. This would allow you a healthy profit and ensure a swift transaction."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your understanding of the product's value. While your offer is reasonable, I believe a price closer to my initial offer better reflects its true worth. I'm willing to come down to $1,175,000. This allows for both of us to benefit significantly from the transaction.
