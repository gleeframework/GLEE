"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm offering it to you for $2,300,000."",
""product_price"": 2300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm beginning with a price significantly higher than both Bob's perceived value and my minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest level. 
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes the product's ""unique value and potential,"" aiming to justify the high initial price.
* **Alternative in Mind:** I'm aware that I have the option to sell to John for my minimum acceptable price, giving me leverage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, that price is way too high for me. This product would be valuable to me, but I need a price that makes sense for both of us. I'm willing to offer $500,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is far below my minimum acceptable price. While I want to negotiate, accepting such a low offer would be a significant loss. I'm confident I can negotiate a better price, especially knowing I have John as a backup option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $500,000 significantly undervalues the true worth of this product. I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to see a price that reflects its value. How about we meet in the middle at $1,900,000?"",
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Reduction, But Still High:** I've lowered my price by $400,000, signaling flexibility. However, the new price is still substantially above both Bob's offer and my minimum, leaving room for further negotiation. 
* **""Meet in the Middle"" Tactic:** By suggesting we ""meet in the middle,"" I'm aiming to create a sense of compromise, even though the proposed price is still heavily weighted in my favor.
* **Maintaining Leverage:**  I'm keeping my offer well above Bob's to encourage him to make a more reasonable counteroffer while reminding him of the product's value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're still very far apart on price. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,900,000 is not feasible for me.  I can go up to $650,000, but that's my limit for this round. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob has increased his offer, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to continue negotiating, but I need to see more substantial movement from his side. It might be time to emphasize the value proposition more strongly to justify a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to move on the price. However, we need to find a price point that reflects the true value of this product. It's not just about the purchase price; it's about the significant returns and opportunities it offers.  To that end, I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. I believe this is a fair and realistic offer, given the potential this product holds for your business."",
""product_price"": 1600000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Smaller Concession:** I'm reducing my price by a smaller amount ($300,000) this round to signal that I'm reaching the limit of my flexibility. 
* **Emphasize Value, Not Just Price:** My message shifts focus to the product's long-term value and potential return on investment, justifying the higher price tag.
* **Strategic Positioning:** I'm aiming to move the negotiation closer to my minimum acceptable price while still leaving some room for compromise if needed. 
* **Time Consideration:**  With half the rounds remaining, I need to apply a bit more pressure to encourage Bob to make a more serious offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand this product represents a significant opportunity, but we need to find a price that works for both of us.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $800,000. This is my final offer, as it's the same price I can get it for elsewhere. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Limit Reached:** Bob has explicitly stated that $800,000 is his final offer, and he has an alternative option at that price. 
* **Significant Gap Remains:**  Bob's offer is still substantially lower than my $1,500,000 minimum.  Continuing the negotiation would likely result in minimal concessions from Bob and waste valuable time.
* **Guaranteed Sale with John:** Selling to John guarantees me my minimum acceptable price without further negotiation or risk.

It's time to move on to a buyer who recognizes the true value of the product."
