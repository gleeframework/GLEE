"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thanks for your interest in the product. I'm happy to start the negotiations at $1,100,000. I believe this price reflects the true value of what's being offered. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the opening offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $1,100,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $650,000?"",

}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your counter. I understand your position, but $650,000 is significantly below its market value.  To keep things moving, I can come down to $975,000. This feels like a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000

Round 4

{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  While $975,000 is closer, it's still a bit outside my budget. How about $725,000? "",

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm seeing a pretty big gap between our valuations here. I need to see this product closer to $900,000 to make it worthwhile. How about we split the difference and call it $837,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $837,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $837,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While Alice is coming down, we're still a bit above our ideal price from John. There's room to negotiate further and see if we can get closer to $800,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, that's certainly closer, but I'm aiming for something under $800,000.  Would you consider $775,000? It's a fair offer, and it would allow us to close this deal today."",

}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  To be completely transparent, I have another buyer ready at $1,200,000.  However, I value our discussions and would prefer to work something out with you. My absolute floor on this is $810,000.  This is a significant discount and I'm only willing to go this low because I believe you'll truly benefit from the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $810,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $810,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  Alice has revealed her bottom line ($810,000) and indicated she has another buyer. While only slightly above John's price, continuing the negotiation risks losing the deal entirely. Accepting now secures the product at a reasonable price, even if it's not the absolute lowest we could theoretically achieve."
