"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $900,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This price reflects the value of the product and gives you a significant savings. Let's close this deal.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I'm trying to be reasonable here.  $925,000 is still a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $937,500?  This is a fair price that's beneficial for both of us.  Let's not let this opportunity slip away.",937500.0,Alice,5,
