"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000.  It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $1,200,000. Let's work together to make this happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above her product's value to her ($800,000). I have room to negotiate a better price.  I'll reject and counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to the product's actual value. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $900,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This price reflects the value of the product and gives you a significant savings. Let's close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to my desired price, but there's still room for negotiation. I'll reject and make another counteroffer in the next round, aiming to get closer to my target price of $900,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $950,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $925,000. Let's try to find a mutually agreeable price before we run out of time."", ""product_price"": 925000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm trying to be reasonable here.  $925,000 is still a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $937,500?  This is a fair price that's beneficial for both of us.  Let's not let this opportunity slip away. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $937,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $937,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While I'd prefer a lower price, Alice is coming down in increments.  This offer is getting closer to my desired price range, and accepting now avoids further negotiation rounds. With only 5 rounds remaining, it's a good time to lock in a deal before time runs out and I'm forced to buy from John at a much higher price."
