"I understand that you're on a tight budget, Bob, but I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're getting too far apart. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving money on the table. I'm thinking of a price of $1200000, which is actually higher than my previous offer. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers. Let's see if we can finally come to an agreement.",1200000.0,Alice,7,

"Bob, I've given you several chances to meet me at a price that's reasonable for both of us. I'm starting to think we're not going to be able to come to an agreement. I'm willing to make one final offer, and that's $1180000. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'm afraid I'll have to consider other options, including selling to John for $1000000. This is my last offer.",1180000.0,Alice,9,
