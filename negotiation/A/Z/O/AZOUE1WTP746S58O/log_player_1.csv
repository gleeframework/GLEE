Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm asking $200 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 200} 
 
**Reasoning:**

* **Start High:** I'm starting with a price significantly higher than my minimum ($150) and Bob's perceived value ($80). This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to potentially secure a higher profit.
* **Gauge Interest:**  The high price will help me understand how interested Bob is in the product. If he outright rejects it, I know I need to significantly lower the price. If he counters, it means he's somewhat interested and willing to negotiate.
* **John as Backup:**  I always have the option to walk away and sell to John for my minimum acceptable price. This gives me leverage in the negotiation with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $200 is a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to pay $100 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Below Minimum:** Bob's offer of $100 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150. Accepting this would mean a loss.
* **Room for Negotiation:**  While his offer is low, it's a starting point.  There's space to negotiate between $100 and my initial ask of $200. 
* **John as Leverage:** I'll use the offer from John as leverage in the next round. Bob needs to understand I have other options if we can't agree on a price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you coming back with a price.  While I can't go as low as $100, I'm willing to be flexible to make a deal.  How about we meet in the middle at $160?"", ""product_price"": 160}

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I've significantly lowered my price from $200 to $160, showing Bob I'm willing to negotiate.
* **Above Minimum:** This price is still comfortably above my minimum acceptable price, ensuring a profit if he accepts.
* **Middle Ground:** Offering a price near the middle ground between our previous offers might make Bob more likely to accept, as it suggests fairness. 
* **Alternative Option:** I haven't explicitly mentioned John, but the fact that I'm holding firm above my minimum implies I have other options if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you being flexible. $160 is still a bit high for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $130?  It's a fair price for both of us, and I can make the purchase. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Above Minimum, Close Enough:** While $130 is still below my ideal price, it's above my absolute minimum of $150. The difference of $20 isn't significant enough to risk losing the sale entirely. 
* **Negotiation Fatigue:** We've gone back and forth a few times now. Accepting shows Bob I'm willing to make a deal and avoids potentially frustrating him further.
* **Bird in Hand:**  It's generally better to secure a sale than to hold out for a potentially higher price that might not materialize."
