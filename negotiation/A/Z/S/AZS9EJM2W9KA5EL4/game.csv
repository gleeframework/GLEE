"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this unique product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,200,000. What are your thoughts?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product, that price point is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to purchase it for $600,000.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $600,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can do $900,000, which is a 25% discount from my initial offer. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $900,000 is still a little steep for my budget. Would you consider $700,000? That's a significant move on my part.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. However, $700,000 is still not as high as I'd like to get for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers, so I can offer you $800,000. This is my final compromise, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",800000.0,Alice,5,
