Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll make an offer to Bob. Since the product is worth at least $80 to me, I'll start with a price that's slightly lower than that. Here's my offer:

{""product_price"": 85}

Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","Bob's offer is $80, which is the minimum value I was willing to accept. I think I'll take the sure thing and accept his offer!
