"Hi Bob, I'm excited to present you with the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm offering it at $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the significant return on investment you'll see.",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in this product, $1,100,000 is still a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it.  This is a fair price considering my maximum budget and the value I see in this product.  What do you think?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you countering and recognizing the inherent value of this product.  However, to be completely transparent, $900,000 falls significantly below my bottom line.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,000,000. This price reflects the product's true worth while acknowledging your interest.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $1,000,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm ready to offer $950,000. This reflects the value I see in the product while remaining within my budget. Let's find a middle ground here and close this deal.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Alice, we're getting closer!  $975,000 is still a bit above my ideal price point. I'm willing to go up to $960,000 for the product.  This reflects my genuine interest in this opportunity and should be very close to your bottom line. Let's finalize this deal.",960000.0,Bob,6,
