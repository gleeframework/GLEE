"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to present you with the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm offering it at $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the significant return on investment you'll see. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is still too high for Bob. He wants to save as much money as possible and has a backup option of buying from John for $800,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to start negotiating and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in this product, $1,100,000 is still a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it.  This is a fair price considering my maximum budget and the value I see in this product.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you countering and recognizing the inherent value of this product.  However, to be completely transparent, $900,000 falls significantly below my bottom line.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,000,000. This price reflects the product's true worth while acknowledging your interest. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,000,000 is a lower price than Alice's initial offer, it's still above Bob's target of $800,000. He can still potentially negotiate a better price and should reject this offer to continue the process."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $1,000,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm ready to offer $950,000. This reflects the value I see in the product while remaining within my budget. Let's find a middle ground here and close this deal."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position and want to make this work. Let's split the difference - $975,000. This offer reflects my sincere effort to meet your budget constraints while ensuring a fair deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $975,000 is closer to Bob's target, he can still try to negotiate a lower price.  He's getting closer to his goal, but he's still got some room to bargain.  Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation going and allows him to potentially achieve an even better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, we're getting closer!  $975,000 is still a bit above my ideal price point. I'm willing to go up to $960,000 for the product.  This reflects my genuine interest in this opportunity and should be very close to your bottom line. Let's finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 960000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence.  However, I need to be firm on the value of this product. My final offer is $967,500. This is a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's more than fair. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $967,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $967,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has reached a point where the negotiation is becoming increasingly difficult. While Alice's final offer is close to his desired price, it's still above his maximum budget of $800,000. 

He has already rejected several offers and there's no guarantee that further negotiations will result in a lower price. It's more beneficial for him to take advantage of his backup option and purchase the product from John for $800,000, ensuring he stays within his budget and avoids potential further complications with Alice."
