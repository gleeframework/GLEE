"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great opportunity for you to get a high-quality item at a competitive price. I'm willing to sell it to you for $10,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $10,000 is a good price, it's still higher than the product's worth to Bob.  He should try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  $10,000 is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $9,000 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to get a price closer to his target of $8,000. A $1,000 reduction from Alice's original offer is a reasonable starting point for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $9,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $9,500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great deal for you! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to get the price as low as possible. $9,500 is still above his target of $8,000, and he should continue to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $9,500 is still a bit outside my budget. How about $9,250?  It's closer to my ideal price, and I think it's a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 9250}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to gradually reduce the price while still showing willingness to negotiate.  A $250 reduction from Alice's offer is a reasonable counter-proposal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're close to a deal, Bob! However, I still need to make a profit, so I'm willing to meet you at $9,500 is not possible, but I can go to $9,375. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's still a great value for you! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,375. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,375
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible, but he also needs to be realistic. Alice has clearly stated this is her lowest price, and Bob is getting close to his target value.  Accepting $9,375 saves Bob $2,625 compared to buying from John and is a good compromise.  Continuing to negotiate might lead to a lower price, but the risk is that Alice will walk away or Bob might run out of rounds before reaching a deal."
