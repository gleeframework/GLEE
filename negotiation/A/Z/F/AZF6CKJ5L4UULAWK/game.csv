"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm a bit surprised by the price. I'm willing to pay a premium, but I'm not sure I can go as high as $9500. I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $8800. I believe this price still reflects the value I see in the product, while being more in line with my budget.",8800.0,Bob,2,
