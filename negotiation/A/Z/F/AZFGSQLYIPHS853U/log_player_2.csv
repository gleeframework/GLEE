"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd love! I'm asking for $150 for it.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Since Bob's maximum budget is $150, it makes sense to try and negotiate a lower price with Alice before resorting to buying from John.  There's a chance Alice might be willing to lower the price, especially since she hasn't provided any information about the product's value to her."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $150 is a bit high for me. Would you be willing to come down to $125? I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget."", ""product_price"": 125}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and I understand you're working with a budget. I'm willing to come down a little to $135. This is still a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to what I need.  Let me know if you're interested in this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  Alice has lowered her price to $135, which is within Bob's budget and represents a decent saving compared to John's price. Accepting the offer allows Bob to secure the product at a good price without risking further negotiation or losing the opportunity to buy from John."
