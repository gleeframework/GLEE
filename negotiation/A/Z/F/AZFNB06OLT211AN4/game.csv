"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer but $12,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  I'm very interested in the product, though, and I'm prepared to offer $9,500.  What do you think?",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your offer of $9,500 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of a price of $11,000. It's still a great deal, and I believe you'll love the product. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm confident that we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to offer $10,500 for the product. Let's close this deal.",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're not going to meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I still need to make a profit. I'm thinking of a price of $10,800. It's a great compromise, and I believe you'll be happy with the product. What do you think?",10800.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer, but $10,800 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm sticking with my offer of $10,500.  This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy. What do you say?",10500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're sticking to your offer of $10,500, but I'm still not willing to give up on making a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $10,700. It's a fair compromise, and I think you'll be happy with the product. What do you think?",10700.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down, but I'm still not comfortable with $10,700.  I'm going to stick with my offer of $10,500. It's a fair price, and I'm confident that it's in both of our best interests to close this deal.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",10500.0,Bob,8,

"Hi Bob, I'm starting to get a bit frustrated that we're not meeting in the middle. I'm willing to make one final offer, and that's $10,600. It's my last chance to make a profit, and I think it's a fair price for the product. If you're still not willing to meet me, I'll have to consider selling to John for $10,000.
