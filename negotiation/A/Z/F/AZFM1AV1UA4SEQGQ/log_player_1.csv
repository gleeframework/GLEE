Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,200,000. I'm confident it will exceed your expectations."", 
""product_price"": 2200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Start High:** Opening with a price significantly higher than both Bob's perceived value and your minimum allows room for negotiation.  
* **Justification:**  While the price is high, highlighting the ""value and potential"" provides a reason for the initial offer and avoids immediately anchoring to Bob's lower perception of value.
* **Gauge Bob's Interest:**  This first offer is primarily about gathering information about how interested Bob is and how he values the product. His response will determine your next move."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer,  $2,200,000 is far beyond my budget. I'm willing to pay up to $800,000 for this product.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is far below your minimum acceptable price. While you want to negotiate, accepting his initial offer would be a significant loss. Proceeding to a counteroffer allows you to explore if there's room for a mutually beneficial deal before resorting to selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $2,200,000 represents a significant discount from the true value and potential this product offers.  To move forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,800,000. I believe this price reflects a fairer compromise."", 
""product_price"": 1800000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant but Gradual Concession:** The counteroffer shows willingness to negotiate but remains above both your minimum and Bob's stated value. A large drop might signal desperation; a smaller drop maintains a stronger position.
* **Reiterate Value:** Emphasizing ""true value and potential"" subtly reinforces that Bob's perception might be undervaluing the product.
* **Test the Waters:**  This counteroffer aims to assess Bob's flexibility.  His response will determine if a deal close to your target is possible or if you need to move closer to your minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,800,000 is still outside my range.  I'm  committed to a maximum of $800,000 for this product. If you're open to discussing a price closer to that, I'm ready to continue this conversation.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has now repeated his absolute maximum price twice. This indicates he is highly unlikely to budge. Continuing the negotiation is unlikely to result in a price anywhere near your minimum, let alone your target. It's time to cut your losses and take John's guaranteed offer of $1,500,000."
