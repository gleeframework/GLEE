"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit above your budget, so I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of an offer of $9,500. It's a fair compromise, considering the product's value to me.",9500.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession. Considering the product's value to me, I'm thinking of an offer of $9,250. It's a small increase from my previous offer, but I believe it's still a fair compromise.",9250.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to make concessions, Alice. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I think we can do even better. I'm thinking of an offer of $9,000 again, but I'm willing to throw in a small bonus for you if you accept. I'd like to propose a deal where I'll give you a small payment of $100 after the sale is complete. This way, you'll still get a good price for the product, and I'll get the deal I'm looking for.",9000.0,Bob,6,

"Thank you for the bonus proposal, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to sweeten the deal. However, I'm still not willing to go below $9,500. I'm willing to consider the bonus, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. How about we meet in the middle at $9,375, and you can still offer the $100 bonus? It's a compromise that I think we can both live with.",9375.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to make concessions, but I'm afraid I've reached my limit. I'm willing to meet you at $9,000, and I'll still include the $100 bonus. I think this is the best we can do, and I'm willing to walk away if we can't agree on this price. Please let me know if this is acceptable to you.",9000.0,Bob,10,
