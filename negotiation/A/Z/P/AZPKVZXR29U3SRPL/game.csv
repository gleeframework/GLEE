"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in this product,  $1,100,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm prepared to offer $850,000 for it. Let's see if we can find some common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to stay within your budget, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $950,000. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial price.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $950,000 is still above my comfort zone. I'm prepared to offer $900,000 for the product.  This is a fair price that reflects the value I see in it, and hopefully, we can reach a mutually agreeable solution.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000. I'm willing to compromise and offer you the product for $980,000. This is a fair price that's closer to your budget, and I believe you'll be happy with the value you'll get from it.",980000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $980,000 is closer, but still a bit above where I'd like to be.  I'm prepared to offer $925,000 for the product. This is a fair compromise and I believe it's a price that reflects the value we both see in this deal.",925000.0,Bob,6,

"I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $950,000, but I'm not going to go any lower. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's a fair reflection of the product's value. Let's see if we can finalize the deal at this price.",950000.0,Alice,7,
