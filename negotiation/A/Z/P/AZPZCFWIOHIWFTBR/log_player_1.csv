Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as you know the value is much higher. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** Offering $13,000 gives me room to negotiate down if Bob counter-offers. 
* **Leaving space for profit:** This price is significantly higher than my minimum, leaving me with a good profit. 
* **Appealing to Bob:**  I'm emphasizing the value to him, making the offer more attractive.

**Next Steps:**

I'll observe Bob's response. If he rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and decide whether to accept or make a counteroffer myself. If the negotiations stall or go too low, I can always fall back on selling to John for $10,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my desired profit margin:** While it's closer to my minimum, it's still not enough to make the deal truly worthwhile.
* **Room for negotiation:** There's still some room to negotiate, as Bob is willing to meet me halfway.  
* **Potential for a better deal:** By rejecting his offer, I can push for a higher price in the next round, possibly closer to my initial offer.

**Next Steps:**

I'll counteroffer Bob with a price slightly lower than my initial offer, but higher than his. This will show I'm willing to negotiate, but also that I won't settle for an unfavorable deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position. While I'm happy to negotiate, $11,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $12,000? This would still give you a good deal and allow me to make a reasonable profit. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** This counteroffer shows I'm willing to compromise by meeting Bob halfway between our previous offers. 
* **Still profitable:** This price is still above my minimum and offers a decent profit margin.
* **Positive tone:**  The message is friendly and positive, aiming to keep the negotiation amicable. 

**Next Steps:**

I'll wait for Bob's response. If he rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and consider whether to accept or counter again. If the negotiations stall further, I'll consider selling to John as a backup plan."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $12,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $11,500. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** $11,500 is just $500 below my minimum desired price, which is a relatively small difference.
* **Risk of losing the deal:**  There's a risk that if I reject Bob's offer, he might walk away completely or offer even less in the next round. 
* **Opportunity cost:** If I reject and counteroffer, I run the risk of spending more time negotiating and potentially ending up with a lower offer than $11,500. 

**Next Steps:**

I'll accept Bob's offer and finalize the deal. It's a good compromise that allows me to sell the product and make a decent profit."
