Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your hard limit, Bob, and I appreciate your transparency. However, I'm not willing to sell the product for $800,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you the product for $825,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value and my costs. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

This is a good time to accept Alice's offer. Here's why:

* **You're close to her bottom line:** Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $825,000.  She's signaled this as her final concession. 
* **Time is a factor:** You're five rounds in with five more to go. While you could keep negotiating, you risk Alice becoming firmer in her position or you running out of time and having to buy from John at the higher price.
* **Significant Savings:**  You're still getting a significant discount from John's price of $1,500,000."
