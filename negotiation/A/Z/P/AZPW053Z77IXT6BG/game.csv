"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product, but given my budget constraints, I am only able to consider offers within $12,000. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to that amount?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is significantly below its true value.  How about we meet halfway? I could let it go for $16,000.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for considering my situation, Alice. While I understand the value of the product, I am still unable to meet at $16,000. Could we perhaps aim for $14,000? This would allow me to stay within my budget while still obtaining the product.",14000.0,Bob,4,
