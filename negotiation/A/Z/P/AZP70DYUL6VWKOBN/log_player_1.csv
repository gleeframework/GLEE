{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm selling this awesome product that I think you'd really love. I'm willing to let it go for $100. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price point that is higher than your minimum, but still leaves room for bargaining. It also establishes a friendly tone and frames the product as something Bob would value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, I'm confident I can get a better price. I'll counteroffer and see if we can meet in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! I'm happy to come down a little, but $90 is still a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference at $95? That seems fair, and it gets us closer to a deal."", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $92.50. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is very close to my ideal price, and I don't want to risk losing the deal by continuing to negotiate.  $92.50 is a good price and a solid outcome for me."
