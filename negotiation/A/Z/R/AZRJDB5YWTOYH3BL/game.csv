"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this price is more in line with my budget and would allow me to get a better return on investment.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $1,350,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value and my investment goals.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
