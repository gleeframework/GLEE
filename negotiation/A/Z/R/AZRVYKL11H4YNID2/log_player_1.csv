Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm not sure I can meet your initial price of $2,300,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $1,150,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate Alice's willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit far from the $1,900,000 mark. I'm willing to meet you in the middle again, so I'm offering $950,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price, considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000.

Bob is consistently offering half of my asking price, and we are still far apart. I need to show I'm willing to negotiate but not at such a steep drop.  I'll counter with a smaller decrease to steer the negotiation closer to my desired outcome."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I see you're serious about this product, and I respect that.  While your previous offer doesn't quite work for me, I'm willing to come down to $1,700,000. This feels like a significant move on my part, demonstrating my eagerness to find common ground."",

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate Alice's willingness to come down, but I'm still not comfortable with the $1,700,000 price. I'm willing to go up a bit, but I'm thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price, considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000

Bob is not negotiating in good faith. He is stubbornly sticking to lowball offers that are nowhere near a reasonable compromise. It's time to cut my losses and take John's guaranteed offer."
