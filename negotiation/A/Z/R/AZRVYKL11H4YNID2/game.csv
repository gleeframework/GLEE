"Hello Bob, I'm excited to be offering you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I believe this reflects the true worth of what's being offered.  Let me know your thoughts.",2300000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm not sure I can meet your initial price of $2,300,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $1,150,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me.",1150000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate you coming back with an offer and acknowledging the value of this product. However, the price you proposed is quite a bit lower than I can consider. To move things along, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. I believe this price point represents a significant compromise while still reflecting the true worth of what's on the table.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate Alice's willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit far from the $1,900,000 mark. I'm willing to meet you in the middle again, so I'm offering $950,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price, considering the product's value to me.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're serious about this product, and I respect that.  While your previous offer doesn't quite work for me, I'm willing to come down to $1,700,000. This feels like a significant move on my part, demonstrating my eagerness to find common ground.",1700000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate Alice's willingness to come down, but I'm still not comfortable with the $1,700,000 price. I'm willing to go up a bit, but I'm thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price, considering the product's value to me.",900000.0,Bob,6,
