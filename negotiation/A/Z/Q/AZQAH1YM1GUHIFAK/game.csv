"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to acquire a truly unique item that I'm sure will bring you immense value. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,800,000.",1800000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, while I appreciate your enthusiasm, $1,800,000 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to offer you $1,400,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in the product. Let me know if you're interested in discussing this further.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to consider a price of $1,600,000 for the product. I believe it's a fair compromise that reflects the value you'll get from owning this unique item.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,600,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to offer you $1,550,000.  This is a significant amount, and I believe it reflects a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can finalize a deal.",1550000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to meet me at a higher price. However, I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to consider a price of $1,700,000 for the product. This is my final offer, and I believe it's the best compromise we can reach. If we can agree on this price, I'm confident we can finalize the deal.",1700000.0,Alice,5,
