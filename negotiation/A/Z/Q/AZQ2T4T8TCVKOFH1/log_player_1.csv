Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I believe this product has the potential to be extremely valuable for your company.  I'm offering it to you at a price of $1,200,000, which is a significant discount from its true worth.  This is a great opportunity for both of us to make a profitable deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:**  $1,200,000 is a good starting point. It's significantly above my minimum, giving me room to negotiate, but also appealing to Bob because it's considerably lower than the product's worth to him.
* **Message:**  I'm framing the offer as a win-win situation, emphasizing the potential value for Bob and the discount he's getting. This builds a positive foundation for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  $1,200,000 is still a bit steep for me. While I recognize the value of this product, I'm only able to offer $900,000 at this time.  This is a fair price considering the potential value for both of us. Let's see if we can find a compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still significantly lower than my desired price.  I'm confident that I can get a better deal by continuing negotiations with Bob.  Selling to John at this point would be a loss for me, as I can still potentially get a much higher price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $900,000 is simply too low for me. I understand you're looking for a good deal, but this product has immense value, and I need to ensure I'm compensated fairly.  Let's find a middle ground.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This is a substantial discount from my initial offer, and a great opportunity for both of us. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:**  I'm offering $1,000,000, which is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer. This shows flexibility while still protecting my interests.
* **Message:**  I'm emphasizing the value of the product and the need for fair compensation, while also suggesting a ""middle ground"" to encourage Bob to accept.  I'm making it clear that I'm willing to negotiate further, but I'm not going to settle for an unreasonable price."
