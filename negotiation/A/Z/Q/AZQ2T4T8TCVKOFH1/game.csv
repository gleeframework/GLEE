"Bob, I believe this product has the potential to be extremely valuable for your company.  I'm offering it to you at a price of $1,200,000, which is a significant discount from its true worth.  This is a great opportunity for both of us to make a profitable deal. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice,  $1,200,000 is still a bit steep for me. While I recognize the value of this product, I'm only able to offer $900,000 at this time.  This is a fair price considering the potential value for both of us. Let's see if we can find a compromise.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $900,000 is simply too low for me. I understand you're looking for a good deal, but this product has immense value, and I need to ensure I'm compensated fairly.  Let's find a middle ground.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This is a substantial discount from my initial offer, and a great opportunity for both of us. What do you say?",1000000.0,Alice,3,
