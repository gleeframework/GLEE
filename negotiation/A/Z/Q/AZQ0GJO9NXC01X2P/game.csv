"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product that I believe will be a valuable asset to your business. I've carefully considered its potential value and am setting the initial price at $1,400,000. I'm confident that this price reflects the product's worth while also leaving room for negotiation. What are your thoughts?",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm interested in this product, but $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for it.  This reflects the value I see in the product, while also leaving room for us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.  Let me know what you think.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and understand your perspective. While I believe the product's worth is higher, I'm willing to compromise. I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000, which I believe is a fair reflection of the value we both see in this opportunity. This offer leaves some room for negotiation, and I hope we can reach an agreement in this round.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,300,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm sticking to my previous offer of $1,200,000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's value, and I believe it allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. If you're not willing to accept this offer, I'll have to consider other options.

"Bob, I understand your position and appreciate your continued interest in the product.  To demonstrate my commitment to reaching a deal, I'm willing to lower my price to $1,250,000. This is a significant concession, and I believe it represents a fair compromise considering the value we both see in this opportunity. I'm hopeful this offer will be agreeable to you.",1250000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise further.  $1,250,000 is getting closer to where I need to be.  I'm willing to go to $1,225,000.
