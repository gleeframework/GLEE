Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand you're looking for a better deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $11,500. This is a fair price considering its value to you is $15,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has come down to $11,500, which is a good price considering your maximum budget is $15,000.  There's a chance you could negotiate further, but the risk is that Alice might reject your counteroffer and you'd be left with the option of buying from John for a higher price.  Accepting Alice's offer ensures you get a good deal and don't risk losing out on the product altogether."
