{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a fantastic deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $1,100,000, which is still above Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive framing:**  My message is positive and focuses on the mutual benefit of the deal.
* **Leaving room for counteroffers:**  I'm not setting a hard limit, allowing for potential negotiation.
* **Back-up plan:**  The knowledge of John's offer at $1,200,000 provides a safety net if negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $950,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $950,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. 
* **Negotiation is possible:**  While Bob's offer is low, it demonstrates his interest in the product.  I can likely negotiate a higher price in the next round.
* **John's offer provides a safety net:** If negotiations with Bob fail, I can still sell to John for $1,200,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $950,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This price still reflects the value of the product, and I believe it's a fair deal for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-offer above Bob's offer:** I'm offering a price higher than Bob's $950,000, but still below my initial offer and lower than my minimum acceptable price.
* **Fair compromise:**  I'm presenting this price as a compromise that reflects the value of the product and offers a reasonable starting point for further negotiation.
* **Positive and open-ended message:**  My message is positive and leaves the door open for further discussion."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1,050,000, but I was thinking more along the lines of $980,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $980,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:**  $980,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.
* **Negotiation is still possible:**  Bob is showing flexibility by increasing his offer, and I believe I can likely get closer to my desired price with another counter-offer.
* **John's offer is a safety net:**  If negotiations with Bob ultimately fail, I can still sell to John for $1,200,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to find a price that works for you.  $980,000 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. How about we settle on $1,020,000? That's a fair price that allows us both to walk away feeling good about the deal.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1020000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-offer closer to Bob's offer:** I'm increasing my offer to $1,020,000, which is closer to Bob's offer of $980,000 but still above my minimum acceptable price.
* **Emphasis on compromise:**  I'm framing my offer as a compromise that demonstrates my willingness to work with Bob.
* **Positive and solution-oriented:**  My message is positive and focuses on reaching a mutually agreeable solution."

Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $990,000.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Negotiations have stalled:** Bob's offer of $990,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. 
* **Small increments:** The negotiation is progressing in small increments, and it's unlikely we'll reach a mutually agreeable price quickly.
* **John's offer is a better option:**  Since John is willing to pay $1,200,000, it's more advantageous to sell to him and avoid further negotiation with Bob."
