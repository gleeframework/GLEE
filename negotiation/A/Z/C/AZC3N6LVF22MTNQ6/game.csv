"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $175 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay right now.  I'm happy to pay $140 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",140.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $140 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $155?  I'm flexible on the price, but I need to make sure I get a fair value for the product.",155.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $155 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $145.  This is my final offer.",145.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $145 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $150, my minimum price.  If you're not interested at this price, I'll have to consider other options. ",150.0,Alice,5,
