"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer but $175 is a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $100 for it.  What do you think?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $100 is too far below what I'm looking for.  How about we meet in the middle at $135? It's still a good deal for you, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit.",135.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $135 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $115. Let's try to find a middle ground.",115.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $115 just doesn't work for me. Let's try $125. This is a fair price for both of us, and it gets us closer to a deal. What do you say?",125.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $125 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $120 for the product. Let's try to close the deal here.",120.0,Bob,6,
