"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As a starting point, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,000,000.",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice! It's a great starting point.  I'm really interested in the product, but I'm hoping to get it for a bit less to make it a truly worthwhile deal for me.  How about $900,000?  I believe this price reflects the value for both of us.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm still confident that the product's value is worth more than $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $950,000. This is a fair price considering the product's unique features and the benefits it can bring to your business.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. I'm still hoping to get the product for a bit closer to my budget. Would you consider $925,000?  I'm really serious about purchasing this product, and I believe this price is fair and will allow us to close the deal.",925000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, I'm still not willing to go below $975,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $975,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a great value for the product's benefits.",975000.0,Alice,5,
