"Alice, your initial offer is far beyond my budget. I'm very interested in this product, but I can't justify paying that much. I'm willing to offer $850,000, which is a significant amount and shows my genuine interest in your product.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer. This product truly holds immense value, and $850,000 doesn't quite reflect that.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,300,000. I believe this price point is still fair given the potential returns you'll see.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your perspective on the value, but unfortunately, I'm still unable to go higher than $800,000.  This is my absolute maximum, and it reflects a significant investment on my part. If you're open to this price, I'm ready to close the deal now. ",800000.0,Bob,4,
