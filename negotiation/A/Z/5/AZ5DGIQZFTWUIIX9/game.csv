"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a game-changer, and I know it would be a valuable asset to your business. I'm willing to part with it for $1200000.  Let's discuss this further and see if we can reach an agreement.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your product is definitely interesting, but $1200000 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $900000 for it.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. However, $900000 is significantly lower than the product's true value.  I'm willing to come down to $1000000,  which reflects a fair compromise.  Let's work together to finalize this deal.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1000000 is still a bit too high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $950000?  This would be a fair compromise and a good deal for both of us.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $950000 simply isn't enough.  I'm willing to come down to $975000.  This is my final offer, and I'm confident that it's a fair deal for both of us.  Let's make this happen.",975000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $975000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. Let's try $960000. This is a fair compromise, and it allows us to close the deal without further delay.",960000.0,Bob,6,
