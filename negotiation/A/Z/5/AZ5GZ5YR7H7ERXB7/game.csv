"I understand where you're coming from, Bob, but $80 is quite a bit lower than what I'm hoping for.  How about we meet in the middle at $130? It's a steal for the value you'll get.",130.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground, Alice.  While $130 is closer, I'm working with a tight budget. Could you do $95?",95.0,Bob,4,
