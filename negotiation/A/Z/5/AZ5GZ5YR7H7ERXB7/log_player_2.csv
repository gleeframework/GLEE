Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand where you're coming from, Bob, but $80 is quite a bit lower than what I'm hoping for.  How about we meet in the middle at $130? It's a steal for the value you'll get.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  How about this - I can go as low as $115, but that's my absolute final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**  Alice seems pretty firm on her price, and it's unlikely she'll go below $100. To ensure you stay within budget, it's time to cut your losses and buy from John for the guaranteed $100 price."
