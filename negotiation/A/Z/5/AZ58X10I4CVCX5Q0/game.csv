"I understand you're looking for a better price, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I still need to make a profit. How about we discuss a price of $120?",120.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice. How about we settle on $95? That's a fair offer that gets us closer to a deal.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're close, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to give up on the profit I need. I can do $110, but that's as low as I can go. It's a great deal for you, and I think you'll really love the product.",110.0,Alice,5,

"I understand, Alice. You've got a great product, and I'm willing to make this work. How about we split the difference and call it $105? That's me stretching my budget, but I'm serious about buying this from you.",105.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob! However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $105. I can do $115, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. It's a great deal for you, and I think you'll really love the product.",115.0,Alice,7,
