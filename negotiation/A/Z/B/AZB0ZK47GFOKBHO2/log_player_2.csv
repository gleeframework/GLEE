{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Alice's initial offer is at Bob's maximum price, so there's no benefit to accepting it. Rejecting allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

At this point, Bob has already rejected Alice's offer twice and made counteroffers.  While Bob could continue to negotiate, there's a risk that Alice will get frustrated and walk away from the deal. Additionally, Alice's offer of $11,500 is a significant improvement from her initial price and still within Bob's budget. Accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product at a reasonable price while minimizing the risk of losing the deal."
