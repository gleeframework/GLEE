"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think that's the maximum I can go. What do you think?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but the value of this product to the right buyer is truly significant. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $900,000 is too low. How about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're willing to come down, but $1,000,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so how about $950,000? I think that's a fair compromise.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $950,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I can't accept anything below $975,000. This product has tremendous potential and I'm confident it will be incredibly valuable to you. Let's make this deal happen.",975000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand your confidence in the product's potential, but I'm still not comfortable going above $925,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so how about $925,000? I think that's a fair compromise considering the price you're willing to accept.",925000.0,Bob,6,
