**Reasoning:**

Bob is consistently sticking to his valuation and only increasing his offers incrementally. It's unlikely he'll drastically change his approach in the remaining rounds. Accepting his current offer would mean a significant loss compared to John's guaranteed offer.  It's time to cut negotiations with Bob and secure the guaranteed $1,200,000 from John."
