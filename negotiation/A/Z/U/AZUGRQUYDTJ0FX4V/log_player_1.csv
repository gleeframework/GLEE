Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", 
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** I want to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($100) as possible without going below my minimum ($120).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $119 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially counter-offer, while still securing a profit if he accepts outright.
* **Time Value & Guaranteed Sale:** While I have a guaranteed sale with John at $120, selling to Bob quickly might be preferable even at a slightly lower profit. 

This strategy aims to balance profit maximization with the potential for a faster sale."
