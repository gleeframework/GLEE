"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I believe a starting price of $1,150,000 is fair. What do you think?",1150000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the value of the product, $1,150,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for it. This reflects the value I see in the product and allows for a fair profit for you. Let me know your thoughts.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,050,000 is below my minimum.  I'm confident this product will yield even greater returns for you in the long run. How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me.  Considering the potential returns, I believe $1,075,000 is a fair price that benefits both of us. It's a strong compromise and gets us closer to a deal.  Let's see if we can make this happen.",1075000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, you clearly see the value in this product.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,090,000, but that's my final offer. It's a small concession for something with such high potential for you.",1090000.0,Alice,5,
