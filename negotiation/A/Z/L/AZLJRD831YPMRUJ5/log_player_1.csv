Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the value of the product, $1,150,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for it. This reflects the value I see in the product and allows for a fair profit for you. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me.  Considering the potential returns, I believe $1,075,000 is a fair price that benefits both of us. It's a strong compromise and gets us closer to a deal.  Let's see if we can make this happen.
