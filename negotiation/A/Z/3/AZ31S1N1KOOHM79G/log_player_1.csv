"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to get closer to my target price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price.  I'm not desperate to sell immediately and John's offer is a solid safety net. I'll try to counteroffer Bob, but if he becomes too stubborn, I can always switch to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $12,500 is just too low for me. I'm willing to compromise a bit more. How about $13,500? This would be a fair price for both of us and allow us to close the deal."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit away from my target price. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $13,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to get even closer to my target. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $13,000 is getting closer to my desired price range. While it's still below my minimum of $15,000, it's a good compromise and I'm getting closer to closing the deal.  There's a risk of losing the sale if I keep rejecting offers, and John's offer provides a safety net.  Accepting this offer secures a sale and ensures a profit."
