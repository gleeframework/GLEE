"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value of this product, $1200000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $850000 for it. This is my best offer, as I'm also considering another option.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're considering other options, Bob, but I'm confident this product will bring you significant value. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1050000. This is a fair price considering the product's worth to you is $800000.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However,  $1050000 is still above my budget. I'm sticking to my previous offer of $850000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to me, and I'm prepared to walk away if we can't reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're firm on your budget, Bob, but I'm not willing to go below $1000000. I'm willing to make one more compromise, so I'm counteroffering at $980000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I'm confident it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",980000.0,Alice,5,
