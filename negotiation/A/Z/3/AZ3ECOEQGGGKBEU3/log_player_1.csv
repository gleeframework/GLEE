Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than your minimum:** You're still making a significant profit over your minimum of $800,000.
* **It's lower than Bob's value:** Bob is still getting a good deal, as the product is worth $1,200,000 to him.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** If Bob balks at the price, you have some wiggle room to lower it slightly while still getting a good price. 

Remember, the key is to find a price that both you and Bob are happy with."
