Hi Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I think you'll really love. I'm willing to let it go for $200. What do you think?,200.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, $200 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in the product, but my budget is around $100. Would you be willing to come down to that price?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $200 is a bit out of your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $100. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $175. What do you think?",175.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $175 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying.  How about $150?  That's a good compromise for both of us.",150.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $175 is still a bit out of your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $150. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer it to you for $165. What do you think?",165.0,Alice,5,
