I'm offering the product to Bob for $10,000. This is a good starting point as it's significantly higher than what the product is worth to him, but still lower than what I'd get from John. This gives Bob room to negotiate while still allowing me to make a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $9,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum value of $12,000. I'll see if I can get closer to that with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm offering to sell the product to Bob for $9,500. This is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway between his offer and my previous offer. Hopefully, this will be attractive enough for him to accept while still allowing me to get closer to my desired price."

I'm going to sell the product to John for $12,000. Bob's offer hasn't changed, and it's still below my minimum price. It's clear that we're not going to be able to agree, and I'm not willing to risk going through further rounds of negotiation only to potentially end up with the same offer.  I'll take the guaranteed $12,000 from John."
