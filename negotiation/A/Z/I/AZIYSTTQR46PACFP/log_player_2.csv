"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I think would be of great value to you. It's worth at least $10000 to me, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $12000. This is a great opportunity to acquire a unique product at a competitive price. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You're willing to pay a maximum of $12,000, and Alice is offering the product for $12,000. While this might seem like a fair deal, you have no information on the actual value of the product to Alice.  There's a chance she's desperate to sell and would be willing to accept a lower price. By rejecting her offer, you can go with John, who you know will sell for your maximum price."
