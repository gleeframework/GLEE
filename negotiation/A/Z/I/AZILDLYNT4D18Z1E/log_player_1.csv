"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1000000} 

I'm starting high, aiming for a significant profit. I'll see if Bob is willing to play ball. If not, I'll be prepared to negotiate down, but I want to gauge his interest level first."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $850,000 is better than selling to John, I'm still hoping to get closer to my initial asking price. I'll counteroffer Bob and see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

I'm coming down a bit, but I'm still holding out for a price that reflects the product's true value.  Let's see if Bob is willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This is a tough call. Bob's offer is only $25,000 more than John's offer, but I'm running out of time. I'm worried that if I keep rejecting, I might end up with nothing but John's offer. It's time to take the sure thing and accept Bob's offer."
