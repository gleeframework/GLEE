"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $10,500?",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11,500. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll find it's still a fantastic deal.",11500.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that $11,000 is still a bit below my target, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11,250. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",11250.0,Alice,5,
