"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to part with it for $950,000. I think this is a fair price considering its value to you, and I'm confident you'll be thrilled with your decision. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $950,000 is less than your $1,200,000 maximum, you can do better. Alice is clearly motivated to sell, and you have a backup option with John.  By rejecting this offer, you might be able to negotiate a lower price with Alice or can buy from John for $1,200,000."
