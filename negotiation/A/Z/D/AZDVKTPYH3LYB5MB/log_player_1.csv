Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd find valuable. I'm willing to part with it for $149. Let me know if you're interested!"", 
""product_price"": 149
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as much money as possible from Bob. 
* **John as a Guarantee:** Knowing John will buy the product for $150 provides a safety net.  
* **High Initial Offer:** Starting with a price close to your minimum ($150) increases the chance of getting a higher profit. While Bob might find it slightly above his perceived value, there's still a chance he might accept if he finds the product desirable enough. 

**Important Note:** There's always a risk Bob will reject the offer. However, this strategy prioritizes maximizing potential profit."
