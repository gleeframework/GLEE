Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $800,000 from John, so that's your baseline.
* **Bob's Value:**  The product is worth $800,000 to Bob. 
* **Information Asymmetry:** Bob doesn't know you have a guaranteed buyer at $800,000.

**Strategy**

You want to offer a price that's attractive enough for Bob to accept, but also maximizes your profit. Since you have a guaranteed sale, you're in a strong position to push for a higher price.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $950,000. I believe this reflects its true worth in the market."", 
""product_price"": 950000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Strong Opening:** You're starting significantly above your minimum, aiming to anchor the negotiation high.
* **Value Emphasis:**  The message highlights the ""unique value and potential,"" justifying the high price without revealing your fallback option.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While starting high, the $950,000 leaves some space for Bob to potentially counter-offer, allowing you to potentially meet in the middle and still secure a profit above your minimum.

**Important Note:**  This is just one strategy.  You could start even higher, but be prepared to potentially negotiate down if Bob pushes back."
