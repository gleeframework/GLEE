"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate the product's value, but $18,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'd be willing to pay $10,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm proposing a price of $14,000 for the product. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll find it's a fair deal.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  However, $14,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. How about $11,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $14,000 is still a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $11,000. I'm willing to compromise further, though. How about we meet at $13,000? It's a bit of a stretch for me, but I think it's a fair compromise.",13000.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, thanks for continuing to negotiate with me. I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  I could meet you at $11,500. I think that's a fair offer, considering it's still below your original asking price.",11500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, $11,500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to get closer to my minimum acceptable price. How about we meet at $12,800? It's a bit of a stretch for me, but I think it's a fair compromise.",12800.0,Alice,7,
