Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. It's a bit lower than your initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
