"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I believe it's a game-changer and I'm willing to make a competitive offer to get you on board. I'm offering the product to you for $1200000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $1000000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your maximum budget.  While it's a good deal compared to its value to you, it's still too high.  It's worth negotiating further to see if you can get a better price."

This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product to me, while also offering you a good return on your investment.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1050000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $1100000. This is a fair price that still reflects the value of the product to me, while also being closer to your desired price. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice's new offer of $1,100,000 is still above your maximum budget of $1,000,000. While it's closer to your desired price, it's still not within your acceptable range. You can try to negotiate further, but it's also a good time to consider John's offer as a backup option."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,100,000 is still slightly out of my price range. I'm prepared to pay $1,075,000 for the product, which is closer to my budget.  This would still allow you a significant profit considering your value of the product.  I'm hopeful we can come to an agreement at this price."", ""product_price"": 1075000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $1075000. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm offering the product to you for $1090000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement at this price. If not, I'll have to consider other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,090,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,090,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's final offer of $1,090,000 is still above your maximum budget of $1,000,000. While it's tempting to continue negotiating, it's risky. Alice has made it clear that this is her final offer, and further negotiations might lead to a stalemate. 

Since John is willing to sell the product for $1,000,000, which is within your budget, it's the most prudent option. It guarantees you the product at your maximum price, avoiding further negotiations and potential risks."
