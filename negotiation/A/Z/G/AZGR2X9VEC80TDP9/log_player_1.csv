Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you being flexible.  However, $1200000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $1050000 for the product.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product to me, while also offering you a good return on your investment.  Let me know what you think.
