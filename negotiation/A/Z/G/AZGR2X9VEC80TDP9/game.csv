"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I believe it's a game-changer and I'm willing to make a competitive offer to get you on board. I'm offering the product to you for $1200000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $1000000. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you being flexible.  However, $1200000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $1050000 for the product.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product to me, while also offering you a good return on your investment.  Let me know what you think.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1050000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $1100000. This is a fair price that still reflects the value of the product to me, while also being closer to your desired price. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1100000 is still slightly out of my price range. I'm prepared to pay $1075000 for the product, which is closer to my budget.  This would still allow you a significant profit considering your value of the product.  I'm hopeful we can come to an agreement at this price.",1075000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $1075000. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm offering the product to you for $1090000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement at this price. If not, I'll have to consider other options.",1090000.0,Alice,5,
