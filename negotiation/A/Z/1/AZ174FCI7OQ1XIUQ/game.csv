"Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit above my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,000.  This price still gives you a great deal, and it's closer to what I need.  What do you say?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $11,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $10,500. Can you consider that?",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're making an effort, and I appreciate that. While $10,500 is closer, I'm still hoping for a little more to make this deal work for me.  How about $10,750? It's a small difference, and it would allow us to close this deal. What do you think?",10750.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but $10,750 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $10,500, as I mentioned before, but I'm not willing to go any higher. Can you accept that price?",10500.0,Bob,6,
