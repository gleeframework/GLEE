,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, your product is great, but $9,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $7,500 for it.  Let's see if we can reach a deal.",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While $7,500 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $8,250?  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and gives us both a good deal.",8250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $8,250 is still a bit too high for me. How about $8,000? That's my absolute maximum, and it's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's seal the deal.",8000.0,Bob,4,
