"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,000. It's a fantastic deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your product is great, but $9,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $7,500 for it.  Let's see if we can reach a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
My reasoning is that, while Bob's offer is lower than my ideal price, I'm still in a good position to negotiate.  I can potentially get a better price from Bob. Selling to John right now would guarantee me my minimum, but there's a chance to earn more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While $7,500 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $8,250?  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and gives us both a good deal."", ""product_price"": 8250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $8,250 is still a bit too high for me. How about $8,000? That's my absolute maximum, and it's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's seal the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

My reasoning:  Bob's offer is exactly my minimum price, and there's no guarantee I'll be able to get a better deal with him in the next rounds. Selling to John now would yield the same amount, but it's worth taking a chance to see if I can secure the deal with Bob."
