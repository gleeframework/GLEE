"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me and your potential profit. What do you think?",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price.  While $950,000 is a tempting offer, I believe the true value of this product is higher. Let's meet in the middle â€“ would you consider $1,025,000?",1025000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $1,025,000 is still a bit above my budget. How about we settle on $1,000,000? That's a fair price that allows us both to benefit from the transaction. Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
