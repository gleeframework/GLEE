"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this fantastic product for $10,000. It's a great deal for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's a bit above my minimum but still leaves room for negotiation. This allows me to potentially get a better price while also showing Bob that I'm willing to work with him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $10,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $8,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, I want to see if I can get a better price. I'm going to reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is a little too low for me.  How about $9,250? This is a fair price that still allows us both to get a good deal."", ""product_price"": 9250} 
``` 
I'm counteroffering at $9,250.  This is a compromise that's closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum.  I'm hoping this will encourage Bob to accept, but I'm prepared to keep negotiating if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm trying to be reasonable here.  How about we split the difference and settle on $8,875? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,875. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,875
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $8,875 is very close to my minimum of $8,000.  Considering I only have 6 rounds left, it's a better option than risking a lower offer or selling to John for $8,000. I'll accept Bob's offer."
