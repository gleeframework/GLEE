"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $8,000 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit.  How about $10,500? This is a fair price considering the value of the product.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I see you're trying to find a price that works for both of us. Let's split the difference. I'll accept $9,750.  This is a fair compromise, and I think it reflects the value of the product. ",9750.0,Alice,5,
