Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $12,500 for it. Can you consider that?

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum price, I'm still aiming for a better deal. I believe I can get closer to my desired price with further negotiation."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. $12,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13,500, which is still a great deal for you considering the value of this product. Let's find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that $13,500 is a good deal, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'm willing to pay $13,000 for the product. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $13,000 is only $500 less than my last offer, and it's significantly closer to my desired price. Given that we're in Round 4, I want to secure a deal.  While I could continue negotiating, there's a risk of Bob backing out or me not being able to reach a better price. Accepting his offer guarantees me a good profit."
