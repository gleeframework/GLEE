"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $10,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $13,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you. Let's make a deal!",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I'm still hoping we can come to an agreement.  I'm willing to go down to $12,500, but that's my final offer.  If you're not interested, I'll have to move on to other buyers.",12500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, you drive a hard bargain!  I understand you're firm on $12,500.  To be honest, that's a little more than I wanted to spend.  How about we split the difference and call it $12,000 even? It's a deal if you say yes!",12000.0,Bob,6,
