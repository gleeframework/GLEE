"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $14,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $10,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000

``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $10,000 is too low for me, and I believe I can get a better price.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $10,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $13,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you. Let's make a deal!"", ""product_price"": 13000}

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $11,500 is closer to my minimum, I'm still confident I can get a higher price. I'll make another counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm still hoping we can come to an agreement.  I'm willing to go down to $12,500, but that's my final offer.  If you're not interested, I'll have to move on to other buyers."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you drive a hard bargain!  I understand you're firm on $12,500.  To be honest, that's a little more than I wanted to spend.  How about we split the difference and call it $12,000 even? It's a deal if you say yes! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $12,000 is my minimum, but I've reached the point where I'm not confident I can get a better price.  John is a safe option, so I'm going to sell to him and avoid the risk of more negotiation."
