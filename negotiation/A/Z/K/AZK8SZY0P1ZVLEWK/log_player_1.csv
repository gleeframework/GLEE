Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal."", ""product_price"": 119}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($80) as possible without going below her own minimum ($120).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high allows for potential counter-offers from Bob. He might be willing to pay a bit more than $80, especially if he perceives the product as valuable. 
* **Secure a Sale:** Offering a price slightly below Alice's guaranteed sale to John ($120) increases the chances of Bob accepting. 

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing profit from Bob while still ensuring a sale if he declines."
