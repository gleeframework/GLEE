{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,500. It's in excellent condition and worth a lot to the right buyer. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's above my minimum value ($12,000) and leaves room for negotiation.  It also shows Bob that I'm confident in the product's value. I'll be ready to counter if Bob rejects this initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $13,000. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $13,000 is better than selling to John, I believe I can do better. I'm going to counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping to get a little closer to my initial asking price.  How about $14,000?  I think this is a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it's a great value for the product."", ""product_price"": 14000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're looking to get closer to your initial price, but I'm still trying to save some money. How about $13,500? I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than that. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

Bob's offer of $13,500 is a good compromise. It's closer to my initial asking price and significantly higher than selling to John. I'm going to accept this offer and finalize the sale."
