"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $100. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $100 is a good deal, Bob can likely do better.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $100 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now.  How about $85?"", ""product_price"": 85}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a price closer to Alice's value of $80. This counteroffer is a significant decrease from Alice's initial offer, demonstrating Bob's willingness to negotiate while still being within the acceptable range for him."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $92? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming to save as much money as possible. While $92 is a better offer than $100, it's still higher than Bob's ideal price point.  Rejecting this offer allows Bob to make another counteroffer and try to get a price closer to his goal.  He's also aware that if the negotiation fails, he can always purchase from John for $150."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $92 is still a bit too high for me. How about $88? This is a fair price for both of us, and we can finalize the deal."", ""product_price"": 88}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is making a small counteroffer, showing that he is willing to compromise but still wants to get a better price. He believes this price is fair, and he wants to avoid going to John unless absolutely necessary.  This offer is also within a reasonable range, giving Alice a good chance to accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $88. I'm willing to compromise again. How about $95? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming to save as much money as possible, and $95 is too close to his limit of $150 from John. He wants to continue negotiating to see if he can get a lower price. He's willing to risk the deal falling through, as he can always purchase from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $95 is still a little too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $90.  Let's close this deal and get this product to me."", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting closer to his upper limit, but he still wants to negotiate. This offer is a small compromise from his previous one, showing that he's serious about buying but still wants a good deal. It also positions Bob to potentially accept a counteroffer of $92 or $93, giving him a better deal than what he'd get from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your willingness to meet me in the middle, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $90. I'm willing to compromise again. How about $97? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $97. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $97
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $97 is only $2 lower than John's price of $150. Bob is nearing his limit for negotiation, and further rounds are unlikely to yield a significantly lower price. Given the limited time and the risk of further negotiation failing, it's more strategic for Bob to secure the product from John. This ensures he gets the product while staying within his budget."
