Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer allows me to make a significant profit while still being potentially attractive to Bob.  Since he values the product at $12,000, a price of $14,000 is still within his range of potential gain, even if it is not his ideal price.  However, it is also high enough for me to earn more than I would from John. If Bob rejects, I can then sell to John for $15,000, but this offer gives me a chance to potentially get a higher price."
