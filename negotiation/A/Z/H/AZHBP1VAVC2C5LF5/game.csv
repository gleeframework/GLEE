,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the product's value, $1,900,000 is significantly above my budget. I'd be willing to consider a price closer to $1,000,000. What do you think?",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your reply. I understand your position, but $1,000,000 is quite a bit lower than I could consider.  There's clearly room for us to find a middle ground. How about we meet at $1,600,000?",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me. $1,600,000 is still a bit high for me.  How about we settle at $1,250,000?  That feels like a fair compromise.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
