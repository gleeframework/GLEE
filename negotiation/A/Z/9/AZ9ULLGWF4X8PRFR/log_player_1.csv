"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a high price, aiming for a good profit margin. $20,000 is a significant amount, but it allows room for negotiation. I don't know Bob's budget or how much he values the product, so starting high gives me a stronger position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

$10,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  While I want to make a deal, accepting Bob's offer would result in a substantial loss.  I will reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17500}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm counteroffering at $17,500, which is a compromise between Bob's offer and my minimum. This shows flexibility while still protecting my interests. I believe this price is fair and might tempt Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $12,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired profit margin. Selling to John for $15,000 would be a safer choice at this point. However, I want to see if I can squeeze a bit more out of Bob. I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 16000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm lowering my counteroffer to $16,000. This is a further compromise, but still leaves me with a decent profit margin. With each round, I need to get closer to Bob's price point, but also make sure I don't sell too low.  I'm hoping that this offer will finally entice Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $14,000 is only $1,000 away from my minimum acceptable price. While tempting, I believe I can still push for a slightly better deal.  I'm hoping to reach a price closer to $15,000, as that's a more satisfying outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm raising my counteroffer slightly to $14,500. This shows that I am willing to compromise but still want to maximize my profit. This price is a good middle ground between Bob's offer and my desired price. I'm hoping that this final nudge will push Bob to accept the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

We're nearing the end of the negotiation rounds, and Bob's offer of $13,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. While I'd prefer to sell to Bob, I'm running out of time and don't want to risk getting stuck with a deal that doesn't meet my needs. Selling to John for $15,000 guarantees my desired minimum profit, making it the safest and most sensible option at this point."
