Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to negotiate a fair price.  I'm starting with $11,500. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. I really like the product, but I'm on a tight budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's far below my minimum price point.  I'm going to try to get a better price from him before I consider selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you're on a budget, but $9,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but how about $10,500?  That's a significant discount from my initial offer, and it's still above what you offered."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $10,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $10,000? I'm really interested in the product, and I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While $10,000 is not my ideal price, it's within my acceptable range and Bob seems serious about buying.  I'm going to accept his offer to avoid potentially losing him as a buyer and having to sell to John at a lower price."
