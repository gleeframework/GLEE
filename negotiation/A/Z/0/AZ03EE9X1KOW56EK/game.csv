"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. I really like the product, but I'm on a tight budget.",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you're on a budget, but $9,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but how about $10,500?  That's a significant discount from my initial offer, and it's still above what you offered.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $10,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $10,000? I'm really interested in the product, and I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",10000.0,Bob,4,
