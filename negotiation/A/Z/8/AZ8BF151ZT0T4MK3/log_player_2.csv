# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,250,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $1,350,000.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your willingness to invest in this product, and I appreciate your flexibility. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $1,300,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you the product for $1,325,000.

Buying from John at $1,200,000 guarantees the best price and avoids further negotiation risk."
