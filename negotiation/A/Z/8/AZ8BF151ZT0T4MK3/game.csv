"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm. However, $1,400,000 is above my budget. I'm willing to offer you $1,250,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the value it brings to me, and it's a good starting point for our negotiation.",1250000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,250,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $1,350,000. This is still a great deal for you, considering the value it brings to you, and it's a compromise that I'm willing to make to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,350,000 is still a bit out of my range. To make this deal work, I'm willing to go up to $1,300,000. This represents a significant investment for me and I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement at this price.",1300000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your willingness to invest in this product, and I appreciate your flexibility. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $1,300,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you the product for $1,325,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a great value for you considering the benefits it will bring. I'm open to further discussion, but I'm not willing to go any lower.",1325000.0,Alice,5,
