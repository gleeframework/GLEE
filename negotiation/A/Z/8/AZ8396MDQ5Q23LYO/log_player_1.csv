"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm opening with a high price to see if Bob is truly interested and how high his budget might be.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  $1,500,000 is significantly more than my minimum, allowing for potential concessions if needed.
* **Setting a precedent:** This sets the tone for the negotiation, showing that I'm confident in the value of the product. 

**Important Note:** This is just the first step. I will carefully analyze Bob's response and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $1,000,000 is my minimum, and I'm not willing to settle for that right away.
* **Opportunity for a counteroffer:**  I want to see if I can push Bob higher. 
* **No urgency to sell to John:**  While John offers a guaranteed $1,000,000, I have 10 rounds and believe I can likely get a better price from Bob. 

**Next Steps:**

* I will counter with a price higher than $1,000,000 but lower than my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** This counteroffer represents a significant drop from my initial offer, showing willingness to negotiate.
* **Strategic pricing:**  $1,250,000 is still well above my minimum and leaves room for further bargaining if needed.
* **Testing the waters:** I want to see if Bob is willing to meet me halfway. 

**Next Steps:**

* I'll carefully monitor Bob's response and adjust my strategy based on his counteroffers or acceptance.  I will be prepared to negotiate further if necessary, but I won't accept anything below my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my desired price:**  While $1,100,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a better deal.
* **More rounds to go:** I have 6 rounds left, giving me time to continue negotiating.
* **Potential for improvement:**  I believe there's still room for Bob to increase his offer.

**Next Steps:**

* I will make a counteroffer, aiming for a price closer to my target. I'll be mindful of Bob's increasing offers and adjust my strategy accordingly."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small increment:**  I'm increasing the price by a smaller amount this time ($50,000) to show flexibility and encourage Bob to meet me halfway.
* **Testing the waters:**  This counteroffer allows me to gauge how far Bob is willing to go.
* **Maintaining leverage:**  While I'm willing to compromise, I'm still not giving in completely. 

**Next Steps:**

* I will carefully evaluate Bob's response. If he rejects, I will either make another counteroffer or consider selling to John if the remaining rounds are limited. 
* If Bob accepts, I've secured a good price and a successful negotiation!"

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:**  $1,050,000 is only $50,000 above my minimum price.
* **Limited rounds:**  I only have four rounds left. 
* **Risk of losing a better deal:**  There's a chance Bob might not increase his offer further, and I could end up selling to John for $1,000,000.

**Next Steps:**

While I would have preferred a higher price, accepting this offer secures a profit and avoids the risk of losing out on a deal altogether."
