"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $100. I think it's a great deal considering its value.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting at $100, which is above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive tone:** I'm framing the offer as a good deal for Bob, which might encourage him to accept. 
* **Open to negotiation:** I'm signaling that I'm willing to negotiate, which is important to maintain Bob's interest. 

**Strategy:**

My goal is to get as close to my minimum acceptable price of $120 as possible. However, I need to balance that with keeping Bob engaged in the negotiation. If Bob rejects my initial offer, I'll adjust my strategy based on his counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value of the product, $100 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to offer you $85. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $85 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $120. Accepting this offer would result in a substantial loss for me.
* **Potential for negotiation:** Bob is willing to negotiate, indicating he's interested in the product. This gives me an opportunity to counter with a higher price.
* **Selling to John is still an option:**  If negotiations with Bob don't work out, I have the security of selling to John for $120.

**Strategy:**

I'll counter Bob's offer with a price closer to my minimum acceptable price. I'll need to strike a balance between being firm and keeping Bob engaged in the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer. While I appreciate your interest, $85 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $95. This is still a good deal for you considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a compromise:** My counteroffer of $95 is a compromise between Bob's offer of $85 and my previous offer of $100. It demonstrates that I am willing to negotiate while still protecting my interests.
* **Positive and encouraging tone:** My message remains positive and encouraging, emphasizing the value of the product for Bob. This helps maintain a good rapport and keeps Bob engaged in the negotiations.
* **Maintaining flexibility:** I'm leaving room for further negotiation, as I believe Bob is likely to counter again. This ensures that the negotiations don't stall and that we can potentially reach a mutually agreeable price.

**Strategy:**

I will continue to assess Bob's counteroffers and adjust my strategy accordingly. I'm aiming to get as close to my minimum acceptable price of $120 as possible while ensuring Bob remains interested in the deal. If Bob rejects my offer again, I will consider a slightly lower counteroffer or potentially consider selling to John if the negotiations seem to be stalled."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $95, but I'm still looking to spend closer to $85.  Would you be willing to meet me at $90?  It's a fair price that benefits both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:** $90 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $120. Accepting this offer would mean losing money on the product.
* **Potential for a better deal:** Bob is showing willingness to negotiate, moving up from his initial offer of $85. This suggests there's room for further compromise.
* **Selling to John remains an option:** While I want to make a deal with Bob, I'm not desperate.  Selling to John for $120 guarantees a profit, which is always an attractive option.

**Strategy:**

I will counter Bob's offer with a price closer to my minimum acceptable price. I'll aim to get a price as close to $120 as possible while maintaining a positive and collaborative tone.  If Bob's counteroffers continue to be too low, I will be more likely to consider selling to John as the negotiations continue."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see you're trying to find a price we both agree on. I appreciate that.  How about we meet in the middle at $92?  I'm willing to come down from $95, and this price still reflects the value of the product.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 92}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** My counteroffer of $92 is a compromise between Bob's offer of $90 and my previous offer of $95. It shows flexibility while still protecting my interests.
* **Positive and encouraging tone:** The message remains positive and focuses on finding a mutually beneficial agreement. This helps maintain a good rapport with Bob.
* **Last chance to negotiate:** I'm framing this offer as a possible final attempt to reach a deal before considering other options. This adds a sense of urgency without being aggressive.

**Strategy:**

I'm getting closer to my minimum acceptable price of $120. If Bob rejects this offer again, I'll need to seriously consider selling to John for $120.  I'll remain open to one more counteroffer from Bob before making my decision."
