"I'm excited to offer you this exceptional product, and I'm confident you'll love it. Let's start with a price of $1200000. This is a fair price considering its value to you, and I'm willing to negotiate further if you're interested.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, $900000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to the value it holds for me. Let's try $1100000. This is a compromise that I'm comfortable with, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's worth to you.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but I need to be careful with my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from our previous discussion, so how about $950000?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. However, $950000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to get closer to the value it holds for me. Let's try $1050000. This is a fair price considering the product's worth to you, and I think it's a reasonable compromise.",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, $980000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to the value it holds for me.

"I'm getting close to my limit, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable with $990000. I'll make one final concession, but I need to get as close to the value it holds for me as possible. Let's try $1005000. This is a fair price considering the product's worth to you, and I think it's a reasonable compromise.",1005000.0,Alice,9,
