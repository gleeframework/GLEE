"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to get your hands on something truly valuable. I'm willing to offer it to you for $14,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $14,000 is a better price than John's offer, Bob knows that Alice values the product at $12,000. This means there's room for further negotiation and potential for a lower price.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity to buy the product.  However, $14,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'd be willing to pay $13,000.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 13000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $13,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $13,500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's counteroffer of $13,500 is a good price for Bob. It's lower than John's offer of $15,000 and closer to Bob's desired price point.  While further negotiation could potentially lead to a lower price, there's a risk that Alice might reject further offers or that Bob might lose the product altogether. Accepting Alice's offer ensures that Bob gets the product for a decent price without risking losing it."
