"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Can you meet me at that price?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're interested in the product, but $120 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, how about $150?",150.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $150 is still a bit out of my budget. Can you consider $130? I really like the product and I'm willing to pay a fair price, but I need to stay within my budget.",130.0,Bob,4,

"I'm glad you like the product, Bob! I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to make a profit. How about we meet at $145? It's a bit above your last offer, but I think it's a fair price for the value this product offers.",145.0,Alice,5,

,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm getting a bit concerned that we're getting too close to the minimum price I'm willing to accept, but I still think this product is worth more than $135. I'm willing to meet you at $140, but I need to make it clear that this is my final compromise. Can you accept?",140.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I really need to stay within my budget. I'm willing to pay $135 for the product. This is my final offer, and I'm willing to walk away if you can't meet me at this price.",135.0,Bob,10,
