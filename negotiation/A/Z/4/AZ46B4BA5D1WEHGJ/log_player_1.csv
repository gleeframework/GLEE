Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}

I'm starting with a high offer, aiming for a good profit. This is close to Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation if he counteroffers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, I'm not willing to settle yet. I can likely get a better price by continuing the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}

I'm reducing my price slightly, but still aiming for a profit well above my minimum. This demonstrates flexibility while keeping the price high enough to be appealing to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still hoping for a better deal. I'm not willing to settle yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

I'm getting closer to Bob's last offer, but I'm still holding out for a slightly higher price. I'm confident I can get this price, considering Bob's interest in the product."

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price. While I can keep negotiating, the time is running out. It's safer to accept John's offer and guarantee a sale at my minimum price."
