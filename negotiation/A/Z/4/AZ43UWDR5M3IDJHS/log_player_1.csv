Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm offering the product to Bob for $20,000. This is a reasonable starting point, as it's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 

* **If Bob accepts:** I make a profit of $5,000.
* **If Bob rejects:** I still get $15,000 from John. 

This strategy balances the desire for a higher profit with the risk of losing the sale entirely.  I can always adjust the price based on Bob's reaction."
