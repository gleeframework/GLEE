"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to own this amazing item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,500. This is a great deal, considering the market value is $10,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

While Alice's offer of $9,500 is tempting, you can do better. You know John will sell you the product for $10,000, so rejecting this offer opens the possibility of negotiating a lower price with Alice or sticking with John's price as your backup."
