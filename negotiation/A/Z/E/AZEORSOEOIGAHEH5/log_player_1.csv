``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's close to my ideal but leaves room for negotiation.  
* **Highlighting Value:** I emphasize the product's value to Bob, hoping to encourage him to accept. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** I end with a friendly tone, signaling that I'm open to negotiation.

Round 2
Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum acceptable price, I believe I can still secure a better deal.  He's clearly interested in the product, and I want to see if I can push him higher. 

**Strategy:**

* **Maintain Leverage:** I'm not desperate, and by rejecting his offer, I demonstrate my confidence and encourage him to increase his bid.
* **Test the Waters:** I want to see if Bob is truly willing to go higher than $850,000.
* **Risk Assessment:** I'm willing to risk losing the deal with Bob, but I'm confident I can either secure a better offer from him or sell to John as a backup."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 just doesn't cover my costs.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $925,000.  This is a significant investment for you, and I believe it'll be well worth it. Let's find common ground."", ""product_price"": 925000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-Proposal:** I'm offering a price that's closer to my goal while still showing flexibility. 
* **Justification:** I'm providing a reason for the counter-offer, emphasizing the value to Bob and the investment aspect. 
* **Call to Action:** I encourage Bob to find common ground, suggesting a collaborative approach. 

**Strategy:**

* **Strategic Compromise:** I'm compromising but not significantly, demonstrating that I'm willing to negotiate but not desperate.
* **Building a Relationship:** By emphasizing the value to Bob and using a friendly tone, I'm trying to build a rapport.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $925,000 is still a bit too high for my budget.  Could we settle at $880,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $880,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $880,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $880,000 is close to my minimum acceptable price of $800,000.  While I'd prefer to get closer to $900,000, I'm recognizing the risk of further negotiation. 

**Strategy:**

* **Risk Management:**  It's getting late in the negotiation, and I want to avoid the risk of Bob walking away or me having to accept John's lower offer.
* **Compromise:**  This offer represents a fair compromise, allowing me to get a price that's significantly better than John's offer.
* **Time Factor:**  With only six rounds left, it's time to secure the sale."
