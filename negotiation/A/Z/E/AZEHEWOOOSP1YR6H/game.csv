"Hello Bob, it's a pleasure to connect with you. I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,900,000.  I'm confident that this is a fair starting point for our discussion.",1900000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer. However,  $1,900,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm thinking closer to $1,000,000. This product would be a valuable addition, but I need to make sure it aligns with my budget.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you taking the time to consider my initial offer. While I understand your perspective, $1,000,000 is significantly below its true value. To find a middle ground, I'd be willing to come down to $1,700,000. This reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your interest.",1700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  However, $1,700,000 still feels a little high. Could we meet in the middle at $1,300,000? I think that's a fair offer that reflects the value of the product.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're clearly recognizing the value of this product, and I respect your approach to this negotiation. Let's aim for a win-win situation. How about we settle at $1,550,000?  This represents a significant reduction on my part while still reflecting the product's true worth.",1550000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the movement.  I'm willing to increase my offer slightly, but $1,550,000 is still a bit beyond where I'm comfortable. Would you consider $1,400,000? That's a significant investment for me, but I believe in the product's potential.",1400000.0,Bob,6,
