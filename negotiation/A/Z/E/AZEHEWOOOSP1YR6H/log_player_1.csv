"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. However,  $1,900,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm thinking closer to $1,000,000. This product would be a valuable addition, but I need to make sure it aligns with my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you taking the time to consider my initial offer. While I understand your perspective, $1,000,000 is significantly below its true value. To find a middle ground, I'd be willing to come down to $1,700,000. This reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your interest."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  However, $1,700,000 still feels a little high. Could we meet in the middle at $1,300,000? I think that's a fair offer that reflects the value of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** We're getting closer to a reasonable price, but we're still significantly above John's offer. Bob's offer is now above his perceived value, showing movement.  There's room for further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're clearly recognizing the value of this product, and I respect your approach to this negotiation. Let's aim for a win-win situation. How about we settle at $1,550,000?  This represents a significant reduction on my part while still reflecting the product's true worth."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the movement.  I'm willing to increase my offer slightly, but $1,550,000 is still a bit beyond where I'm comfortable. Would you consider $1,400,000? That's a significant investment for me, but I believe in the product's potential. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  Bob is now offering $1,400,000, which is a reasonable gain over John's offer of $1,500,000. While we might be able to push for a bit more in subsequent rounds, there's a risk that Bob might reduce his offer or walk away. Taking the $1,400,000 now represents a solid profit and avoids the uncertainty of continued negotiation."
