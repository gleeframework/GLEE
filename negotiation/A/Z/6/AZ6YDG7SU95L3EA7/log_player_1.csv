Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a [product description] that I believe is very valuable. I'm offering it to you for $18,000.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 18000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:**  I've chosen a price of $18,000, which is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable value of $12,000. This gives me room to negotiate. 
* **Enthusiastic Tone:**  The message is positive and emphasizes the value of the product to pique Bob's interest.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message makes it clear I'm open to negotiation, suggesting I'm willing to find a price that works for both of us.

**Strategy:**

This strategy balances the need to maximize profit with the risk of losing the deal entirely.  By offering a high initial price, I aim to:

* **Gauge Bob's Interest:**  His response will give me an idea of his perceived value of the product and his willingness to negotiate. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  If Bob finds the initial price too high, it gives us space to negotiate downwards. 

**Next Steps:**

Depending on Bob's response, I'll adjust my strategy:

* **If Bob accepts:** Great! I've secured a good price.
* **If Bob rejects:** I'll analyze his counteroffer and either accept, reject, or make a counteroffer of my own, keeping my minimum acceptable price of $12,000 in mind.
* **If negotiations stall:**  I'll consider selling to John for $12,000 to avoid losing the opportunity completely."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $18000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $12000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $12,000 is my minimum acceptable price. While I would ideally like to earn more, accepting his offer ensures a sale and guarantees my minimum desired profit.  

**Reasoning:**

* **Profit Assurance:** Accepting Bob's offer secures a sale at my minimum acceptable value, avoiding the risk of further negotiation or losing the sale altogether. 
* **Time Efficiency:**  Accepting the offer avoids further rounds of negotiation, potentially saving time and effort. 
* **Avoiding Uncertainty:**  Continuing to negotiate carries the risk that Bob may become less interested or that I might end up settling for a lower price.

**Next Steps:**

I will proceed to finalize the sale with Bob."
