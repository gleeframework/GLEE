Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $20,000 is a bit too high. I'm willing to pay $15,000 for it. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate you countering.  While $15,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, I understand your perspective. Could you meet me halfway at $17,500?"",

}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $17,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $16,000 for the product. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While I could push Bob a little further, accepting his offer of $16,000 is a good deal. It surpasses my minimum acceptable price and allows me to avoid the risk of not reaching a deal with Bob at all."
