"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. While I value your offer, $12000 doesn't quite reflect the true worth of this product.  How about we meet in the middle at $13500? This price still allows you to secure a valuable asset while acknowledging its unique features and potential.",13500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $12000. Would you be willing to consider $12500? I'm willing to make a compromise, but I need to stay within my budget.",12500.0,Bob,4,
