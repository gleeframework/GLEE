"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm glad we're able to continue the negotiation. However, I'm still a bit above your last offer.

I'm willing to make one last concession, but I need to get as close as possible to my minimum price. I'm now offering the product to you for $1550000 is too high, so I'm going to try $1590000.
