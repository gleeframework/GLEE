Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides. What do you say?"",
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $120, you aim to get as close to that price as possible from Bob.
* **Negotiating Room:**  Starting at $119 leaves a small window for potential counter-offers from Bob while still ensuring a profit.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  The phrase ""limited time"" might encourage Bob to make a decision quickly."
