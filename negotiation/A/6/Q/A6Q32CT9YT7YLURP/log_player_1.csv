Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $11,500. I believe it would be highly valuable to you, and this price reflects a fair deal for both of us."", 
""product_price"": 11500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to Bob's $12,000 valuation as possible without scaring him off.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $11,500 leaves some wiggle room if Bob tries to negotiate down. 
* **Higher than John's Offer:** The offer must be significantly higher than the $10,000 Alice is guaranteed from John to make it worthwhile. 

This strategy aims to strike a balance between a price that's attractive to Bob while still maximizing Alice's potential profit."
