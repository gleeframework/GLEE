"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this exceptional product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $950,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering its worth to you."", 
""product_price"": 950000
}
``` 
 
**Reasoning:**

* **Start High, but Reasonable:**  I'm beginning with a strong offer close to Bob's valuation ($1,000,000) to aim for the maximum profit. However, it's not so high that it's likely to scare him off immediately.
* **Justification:** Providing a reason (""its value and potential"") for the price makes it seem less arbitrary and more anchored in actual worth.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** This initial offer leaves space for Bob to counter-offer, allowing me to gauge his willingness to pay and adjust my strategy accordingly.

This strategy aims to maximize profit while keeping Bob engaged in the negotiation process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $850,000 is tempting, it's still significantly below my target price and leaves a substantial amount of potential profit on the table. I'm confident I can negotiate a better deal, especially since we're only in Round 2. I'll aim for a counteroffer that bridges the gap and keeps the negotiation moving in a positive direction."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While $850,000 is certainly a respectable figure, the true value of this product is undeniable. To find a middle ground, I propose a price of $925,000. This reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your initial offer."", 
""product_price"": 925000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** I'm lowering my price by $25,000, which is a significant enough concession to show Bob I'm willing to negotiate but not so drastic that it undermines my position. 
* **Holding Firm:**  I'm still holding firm above the $900,000 mark, as I believe this product can fetch a premium price.
* **Justification:** By reiterating the product's value, I'm reinforcing its worth in Bob's mind and justifying the higher price point. 
* **Finding Middle Ground:**  The language emphasizes finding a compromise, which can encourage Bob to reciprocate with a counteroffer closer to my target."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not convinced that $925,000 is the right price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $825,000. I believe this is a fair price for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is moving closer to my minimum, but his offer of $825,000 is still too low. It seems he's trying to anchor the price in the low 800s. I'll continue negotiating to see if I can push him further. We are still relatively early in the negotiation, and I want to test his willingness to move beyond this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a competitive price, and I want to find a solution that works for both of us.  How about we settle on $875,000?  This demonstrates my willingness to compromise while still reflecting the value of this unique product."", 
""product_price"": 875000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Movement:** I'm making a substantial concession by dropping $50,000 to show Bob I'm serious about closing the deal.
* **Strategic Positioning:** This offer is halfway between his last offer ($825,000) and my previous counteroffer ($925,000), encouraging a sense of fairness.
* **Final Push:** By framing this as a compromise, I'm subtly signaling that it's a strong offer, and further haggling might be less fruitful. 

This approach aims to secure a deal significantly above my minimum while avoiding a stalemate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your continued negotiation, Alice. I'm willing to meet you at $800,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has reached his final offer of $800,000, which matches what I can get from John.  At this point, continuing negotiations with Bob is unlikely to yield a better outcome. There's no guarantee Bob will budge from his ""final offer,"" and I risk him walking away entirely. It's time to secure a guaranteed profit with John."
