"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $120 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $90 for it.  Let me know what you think.",90.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $120 is a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $90. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $105. What do you think?",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $105 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $100 for it.  It's my top offer.",100.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $100 is your top offer, but I'm still not willing to sell it to you for that price. I'm willing to give you a slight discount, but I think the product is worth more than that. I'm willing to sell it to you for $110. What do you think?",110.0,Alice,5,
