"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $170. I think it's a great deal for something of this quality."",
 ""product_price"": 170
}
```

Rationale:

* **Starting High:** We start with an offer significantly higher than both your minimum ($120) and Bob's perceived value ($100). This achieves two things:
    * **Anchoring:**  It sets a high reference point, potentially influencing Bob's perception of the product's value.
    * **Room for Negotiation:**  It provides ample space to negotiate downwards, making concessions seem more significant.

* **Positive Framing:** The message emphasizes the product's quality and presents the price as a ""great deal,"" subtly suggesting that it's worth the higher price. 

The goal is to gauge Bob's willingness to pay and leave room for a mutually agreeable price within the next few rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. I'm willing to make a deal at that price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Rationale:**

Bob's offer of $90 is below your minimum acceptable price of $120. While it's closer to his perceived value, you have plenty of room for negotiation and rounds left.  It's too early to accept a loss. You'll counter-offer in the next round, attempting to steer the negotiation closer to your desired outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""I understand your position, Bob, but $90 is quite a bit lower than what I had in mind.  How about we meet halfway and settle on $130?"",
 ""product_price"": 130
}
```

**Rationale:**

* **Strategic Concession:** We're making a significant concession from our initial $170 offer down to $130, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate.
* **Anchoring to the Middle Ground:** By proposing a price exactly halfway between our initial offer and Bob's counteroffer, we're establishing a new reference point that's closer to our desired outcome. 
* **Maintaining Profit Margin:** The $130 price point still ensures a profit above your minimum ($120).

This approach aims to signal flexibility while still pushing for a price that's beneficial to you."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet halfway, but I'm still a bit hesitant to pay $130. How about we try $110? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Rationale:**

Bob is inching closer to your minimum price, but $110 is still below your threshold. It's important to hold firm and signal that you're not desperate to close the deal at any cost.  You'll reject this offer and propose a counteroffer closer to your target in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. To be honest, $120 is the absolute lowest I can go. It's a very competitive price for a product of this quality."",
 ""product_price"": 120
}
```

**Rationale:**

* **Revealing Your Bottom Line (Strategically):** It's time to signal to Bob that you're getting close to your limit.  By stating that $120 is the lowest you can go, you're setting a firm boundary while still maintaining a collaborative tone.
* **Highlighting Value:**  Reiterating the product's quality reinforces its worth and justifies the price.
* **Prompting a Decision:**  By offering your bottom line, you're putting the ball in Bob's court and encouraging him to make a decision.

This approach aims to secure a deal at your minimum acceptable price without jeopardizing the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your honesty, but I'm afraid I'm not willing to go above $100. I'm willing to make a deal at this price, but no higher. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Rationale:**

Bob has made it clear that $100 is his absolute limit. You've been firm in your negotiation and reached your minimum acceptable price of $120. Continuing the negotiation is unlikely to result in a better outcome for you.  Therefore, the best decision is to exercise your option to sell the product to John for the guaranteed $120."
