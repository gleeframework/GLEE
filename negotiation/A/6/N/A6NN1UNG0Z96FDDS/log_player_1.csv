{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for a product worth significantly more.  Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Motivating Offer:**  I'm framing it as a ""great deal"" to encourage Bob to consider it. 
* **Leaving Room:** This offer allows for potential counteroffers from Bob while still leaving me with a profit significantly higher than selling to John. 
* **Prepared for John:** I'm aware of John's offer and will keep it in mind during negotiations with Bob. I'll only accept Bob's counteroffer if it's closer to my minimum value of $1,200,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate it, but I am only able to pay up to $900,000 for the product. I hope this revised offer is acceptable to you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable value of $1,200,000**.  
* **There's room to negotiate**. While Bob's offer is closer than his initial perceived value, I can still try to get closer to my desired price.
* **Maintaining leverage**. I want to see if I can push Bob further, especially since I have a guaranteed buyer in John."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm aiming for a price closer to $1,000,000.  This product holds a lot of value, and $900,000 doesn't quite reflect that.  Would you be willing to consider a price of $950,000?  This would be a win-win situation for both of us."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Up:**  I'm increasing my offer slightly from the previous round, but still staying below my ideal price. 
* **Framing it Positively:**  I'm emphasizing the ""win-win"" aspect, suggesting that meeting at $950,000 is mutually beneficial.
* **Keeping it Real:** I'm not going to lowball Bob at this point. He's shown some willingness to negotiate, and I want to keep the conversation moving towards a deal.
* **Keeping John in mind:** While I'm willing to negotiate with Bob, I still have John as a backup, so I'm not desperate to close a deal at a significantly lower price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. While I respect the value you place on the product, I must stick to my budget. I am willing to offer $925,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close, but not close enough:**  While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable value, it's still $275,000 below my desired price.
* **Potential for a better deal:** I believe I can still push for a higher price, especially since I have John as a guaranteed buyer. 
* **Negotiation is a process:**  I'm willing to continue the negotiation and see if I can get closer to my goal.  If Bob's counteroffers keep coming close, I might accept, but for now, I'm not giving up."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still aiming for a price closer to $950,000. How about we split the difference and settle on $937,500? It's a fair compromise that gets us both closer to our desired outcome. "", ""product_price"": 937500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** I'm proposing a middle ground between my last offer and Bob's latest counteroffer. This shows flexibility and a willingness to reach a compromise.
* **Focus on Fairness:**  I'm emphasizing the ""fair compromise"" aspect to make the offer more appealing.
* **Moving Towards Acceptance:**  While it's still below my ideal price, it's getting closer to my minimum value and could lead to a deal.
* **Keeping John as a Safety Net:**  If Bob doesn't accept, I still have John as a backup, so I'm not feeling pressured to accept a significantly lower offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your proposal. I appreciate the effort to find a middle ground. However, given my budget constraints, I can only commit to $930,000 for the product. I hope this revised offer meets your needs. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $930,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $930,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close, but still below my minimum:**  While Bob's offer is very close to my desired price, it's still $90,000 below my minimum acceptable value of $1,200,000.
* **Risk of further concessions:**  I've already made significant concessions, and continuing to negotiate with Bob could lead to further compromises that bring the price even lower.
* **Guaranteed Profit with John:**  Selling to John ensures a profit of $1,200,000, which is significantly higher than Bob's offer.  This guarantees the best financial outcome for me.
* **Avoiding Potential Deadlock:**  If I keep rejecting Bob's offers, we could reach a stalemate, and both of us might miss out on the deal. Selling to John removes that risk."
