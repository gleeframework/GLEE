"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm aiming for a price closer to $1,000,000.  This product holds a lot of value, and $900,000 doesn't quite reflect that.  Would you be willing to consider a price of $950,000?  This would be a win-win situation for both of us.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your position, Alice. While I respect the value you place on the product, I must stick to my budget. I am willing to offer $925,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",925000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still aiming for a price closer to $950,000. How about we split the difference and settle on $937,500? It's a fair compromise that gets us both closer to our desired outcome. ",937500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, thank you for your proposal. I appreciate the effort to find a middle ground. However, given my budget constraints, I can only commit to $930,000 for the product. I hope this revised offer meets your needs.",930000.0,Bob,6,
