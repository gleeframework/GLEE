Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd really find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $150. Let me know what you think!"",
""product_price"": 150
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with an offer higher than your minimum acceptable price ($100). This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a higher profit.
* **Gauging Interest:**  The $150 offer is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($100).  His response will give you insight into how much he wants the product and his willingness to negotiate. 
* **Alternative Option:** You always have the option to sell to John for $100. By starting high with Bob, you're essentially seeing if you can get a better deal than your guaranteed backup."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product, but I am only able to pay up to $100 for it. Would you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer matches his perceived value, it's still below your minimum. You'll try to negotiate a slightly better price before resorting to John or accepting Bob's current offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $100 is too low for me. Could you do $120?  That's a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 120
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** This counteroffer demonstrates flexibility and a willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a price higher than your minimum. 
* **Justification:** Providing a reason (""fair compromise"") can make the offer seem more reasonable to Bob.
* **Testing the Waters:** This offer will help gauge if Bob is willing to budge at all or if he's firmly set at $100."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate the compromise, but I'm still unable to go above $100 for the product. Would you consider $110? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Profitable Deal:** Bob's offer of $110 is a $10 profit over your guaranteed sale to John.
* **Diminishing Returns:**  Further negotiation might not yield a significantly better outcome. Bob seems anchored at $100 and is increasing his offer in small increments.
* **Time Value:** Continuing negotiations prolongs the sale. Accepting now secures the profit and allows you to move on."
