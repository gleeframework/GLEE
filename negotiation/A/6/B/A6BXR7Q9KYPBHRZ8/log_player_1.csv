Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $130. I believe it offers significant value at this price, especially considering it's worth $150 to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's maximum valuation ($150) as possible. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high allows for potential negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, but even if he gets a slight discount, you'll still earn significantly more than selling to John.
* **Confidence:** Offering a strong initial price can signal the product's value.

**Important Note:**  This strategy assumes you have some knowledge of Bob's valuation. If you're entirely in the dark, you might adjust your starting price lower to increase the chance of a sale, knowing you have a backup buyer."
