Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering the product. I understand its value to you, but my budget is limited. I am willing to pay up to $8,000 for the product. Could we possibly meet in the middle?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $8,000 is my minimum, I'm not desperate to sell right away. Bob's initial offer is too low, and I believe I can get a better price by continuing the negotiation.  I'm not ready to sell to John yet, as I'm hoping for a higher offer from Bob."
