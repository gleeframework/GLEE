"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it's worth a significant amount, and I'm initially setting the price at $15,000. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than my maximum budget of $10,000.  It's worth exploring a counteroffer to see if we can find a price that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for the offer.  I understand your position, but $8,000 is quite a bit lower than I'm willing to go. Could you meet me halfway at $11,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to my target price, it's still above my $10,000 limit. I'll try another counteroffer to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
