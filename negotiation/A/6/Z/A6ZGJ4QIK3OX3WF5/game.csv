,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,000,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $700,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the market conditions.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However,  $700,000 undervalues the product significantly. I'm willing to come down to $925,000. This offer stands as a testament to my willingness to negotiate while ensuring a fair deal for both of us.",925000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $925,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to pay $775,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the market conditions and my budget.",775000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm seeing a pattern of offers that don't reflect the true value of this product.  I'm willing to accept $875,000 â€“ it's a firm offer, and a fair one considering what I'm bringing to the table. ",875000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm still not convinced that $875,000 is the right price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to be comfortable with the price. I'm offering $825,000 for the product. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",825000.0,Bob,6,
