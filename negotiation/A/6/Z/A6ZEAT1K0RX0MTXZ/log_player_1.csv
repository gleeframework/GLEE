Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. That's my best offer for now. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  $1,100,000 is too far below my minimum. I want to see if I can get closer to my target price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $1,100,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000.

Round 4
Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  While it's getting closer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I want to see if I can push him further or if it's time to move on to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm trying to be flexible here, but $1,150,000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000. That's a fair price considering the value you'll get from this product. This is my final offer. Let me know your decision."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,200,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go as low as $1,080,000. That's my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,080,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John. Bob's final offer is still below my minimum acceptable price, and we're running out of rounds. It's better to secure the guaranteed $1,500,000 from John than to risk getting less from Bob."
