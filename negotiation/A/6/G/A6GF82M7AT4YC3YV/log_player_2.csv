"Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* You value the product at $150.
* Alice is offering it for $140, which is less than your value.
* Buying from John would cost you $150.

Therefore, accepting Alice's offer is the best decision as it saves you $10 compared to buying from John."
