{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think it would be a great fit for you! I'm offering it to you for $12,000. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting with a price of $12,000. This is a good starting point as it's higher than what Bob values the product at, but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Message:**  I'm being friendly and positive, highlighting the product's value to Bob. This helps build rapport and sets a positive tone for the negotiation.

**Strategy:**

* **Start High:**  By starting with a price higher than what Bob values the product at, I create room for negotiation.
* **Maintain a 'Selling' Mindset:**  I'm highlighting the product's benefits and value to Bob to make him want to buy it.
* **Be Ready to Counter:** I'm prepared to make counteroffers if Bob rejects my initial offer.
* **John as a Safety Net:**  Knowing John is willing to pay $15,000 gives me a strong bargaining position. If Bob doesn't come close to my ideal price, I can walk away and sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $12000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $9,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm still holding out for a higher price. Bob is showing interest, and I believe I can push for a better deal.  

**Strategy:**

* **Counter-Offer:** I will make a counter-offer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my $12,000 asking price.
* **Maximize Profit:**  I want to get as close to my ideal price as possible before potentially selling to John. 
* **Maintain Leverage:**  By rejecting Bob's offer, I'm showing him that I'm not desperate and that I'm willing to walk away if necessary."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and I'm willing to negotiate.  $9,000 is a little too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $10,500.  This product is truly special, and I think it would be a great investment for you.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-Offer:** I'm moving closer to Bob's offer but still holding out for a price that's significantly higher than what he offered.
* **Maintain Leverage:** By not accepting his offer outright, I'm showing that I'm still in control of the negotiation and that I'm not desperate for a deal.
* **Focus on Value:** I'm emphasizing the product's value and its potential benefits for Bob to make him more willing to pay more.
* **Moderate Compromise:** The price reduction shows willingness to compromise but avoids giving too much away.

**Strategy:**

* **Strategic Compromise:** I'm making a small compromise to show flexibility but still aiming for a price that's closer to my goal.
* **Maintain Pressure:** I'm keeping the pressure on Bob by not accepting his offer and proposing a counter-offer.
* **Prepare for Next Round:** I'm ready to further adjust my counter-offer if Bob rejects this one, always keeping John's offer as a safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $10500 is still a bit above my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $9800. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget. Can you consider that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $9,800 is getting closer to my minimum, and I'm starting to feel the pressure.  While it's still less than I'd hoped for, I'm choosing to accept this offer for the following reasons:

* **Risk of Losing Deal:** There's a risk that if I reject Bob's offer, he might walk away completely, leaving me with no sale.
* **Approaching Minimum:**  $9,800 is not far from my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Time Factor:**  Continuing to negotiate could take more time, and I may not get a better offer from Bob. 

**Strategy:**

* **Risk Assessment:** I'm weighing the risk of losing the deal versus the potential for a slightly higher offer in the future.
* **Pragmatism:**  I'm acknowledging that sometimes it's better to accept a deal that is ""good enough"" rather than hold out for something that may never happen. 
* **Time Value:**  By accepting this offer, I can finalize the deal and move on to other opportunities."
