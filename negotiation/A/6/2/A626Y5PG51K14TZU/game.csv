,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $90 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $60 for it. What do you think?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but $60 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down a bit to $85. This price reflects the value of the product and ensures we both get a fair deal. Let me know if you're interested.",85.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $85 is still more than I'm looking to spend.  How about $70?  That feels like a fair compromise.",70.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $70 is just not enough for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $75. This is a good price for both of us, and it allows us to close the deal. What do you think?",75.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting closer. I appreciate you meeting me halfway. How about $72? That's my final offer.",72.0,Bob,6,
