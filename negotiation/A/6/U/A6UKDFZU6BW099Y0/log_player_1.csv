{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that I think you'd really enjoy! I'm asking for $175 for it, but I'm open to negotiating."", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

This offer is a starting point for the negotiation. I'm asking for a price higher than Bob's perceived value but still below my minimum. This gives me some room to negotiate down if Bob counteroffers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand your value for the product, but I believe I can't exceed $80 for it. Would you consider meeting me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is far below my minimum acceptable price of $150. While it's tempting to accept his offer and get something, it's important to remember that I can get a better price by continuing to negotiate or selling to John.  I will counteroffer Bob with a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still not quite there. $80 is significantly lower than what I need to make this work.  How about we split the difference and settle on $125? It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 125}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your response. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $95. I hope this works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer of $95 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below my desired range. I'm confident that I can get a better deal by continuing to negotiate with Bob.  I will counteroffer with a price closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $95 is still a bit too low for me. To make this work, I need to be closer to $125. How about we settle on $110?  This would be a fair price for both of us and help us close the deal."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I've considered your latest offer and am willing to move to $100. I hope this brings us closer to a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While Bob's offer of $100 is getting closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  I've been negotiating with Bob for a while, and it seems like he's unwilling to go higher. To maximize my earnings, I'll sell the product to John for $150."
