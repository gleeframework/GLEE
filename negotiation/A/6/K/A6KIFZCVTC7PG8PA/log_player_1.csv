Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its incredible value and potential, I'm confident it would be a worthwhile investment for you at $1,800,000. Let me know your decision soon, as I have other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 1800000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $1,000,000 (John), you can afford to start with a significantly higher offer to Bob. This maximizes your potential profit.
* **Justification:** The message subtly hints at the product's value and the existence of other potential buyers, creating a sense of urgency and desirability. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While the initial offer is high, it allows room for Bob to negotiate if he's truly interested.  You can always lower the price slightly if needed, knowing you have a fallback option. 

This strategy aims to capitalize on Bob's potential willingness to pay a premium for something he values highly."
