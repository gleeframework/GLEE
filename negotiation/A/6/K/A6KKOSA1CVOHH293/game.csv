"Hey Alice, $120 is a bit steep for me. How about $90? I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is tight.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $90 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down a little. How about $105? That's a fair compromise, and I think it's still a great value for you.",105.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, $105 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Let's split the difference at $100. This is the best I can do, but I'm really hoping we can make this deal work.",100.0,Bob,4,
