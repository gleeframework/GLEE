,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm afraid $8000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to consider a price of $10500. This is a fair compromise, taking into account the value you'll get from the product. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still very interested in the product, but I'm not willing to go up to $10500. I'd be willing to meet you halfway at $9250. Would you consider that?",9250.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Bob! However, I'm still not quite comfortable with $9250. I'm willing to compromise further and offer you a price of $10000.
