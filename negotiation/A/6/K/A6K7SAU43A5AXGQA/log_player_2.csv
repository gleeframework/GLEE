It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice.  $600,000 is a good starting point, but there's likely room for a lower price."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

I'm starting with a lower counteroffer to see if Alice is willing to negotiate.  I'm hoping to land somewhere in the middle."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $500,000.

Alice has come down to $500,000, which is a good deal for me. It's better than what John is offering, and there's a chance I could continue to negotiate, but the risk of Alice getting frustrated and rejecting further offers is high.  It's best to take the deal at this point."
