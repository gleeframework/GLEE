I'm still thinking $90 is a fair price for the product. Can you consider meeting me at that price?,90.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're sticking to $90, but I'm still not quite there. How about we meet in the middle at $92.50?  It's a small compromise on both our ends, and it gets us closer to a deal.",92.5,Alice,5,
