"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $120 to start. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120} 
 
**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with an offer higher than your minimum acceptable price ($100). This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to potentially secure a better deal.
* **Gauge Bob's Interest:** The $120 offer is a way to gauge Bob's interest. If he accepts immediately, you know there was potentially more room for profit. If he rejects it, it opens the door for counteroffers.
* **Alternative Option:**  Keeping John's offer ($100) in mind provides a safety net. If negotiations with Bob don't progress favorably, you have a backup plan."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the recommendation, but I was hoping to stay within my budget of $80. Would you consider lowering the price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is exactly his stated value for the product.  While accepting would close the deal, it's too early to settle for his first offer. Rejecting and providing a counter offer allows for negotiation towards a price closer to your minimum. You can afford to be a bit more flexible, knowing you have John as a backup option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your budget, but I can't go as low as $80.  How about we meet in the middle at $100?"",
""product_price"": 100
} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** This counter-offer presents a common negotiation tactic that can feel fair to both parties. It shows a willingness to compromise while still aiming for your minimum acceptable price.
* **Firm but Fair:** The message emphasizes that $80 is too low but offers a solution to move the negotiation forward. 
* **Backup Plan:** You're still in a strong position with John's offer as a backup if Bob rejects this counteroffer."
