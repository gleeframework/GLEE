Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested but that price is a little high for me. Would you consider $1,100,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is too low. It's better to keep negotiating with Bob, as I can potentially get a better price.  I'm not yet ready to sell to John at $1,200,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest but $1,100,000 is too low.  Let's split the difference â€“ I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000. This is a fair price considering the value to you."", ""product_price"": 1250000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,175,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,175,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm still hoping for a higher price. I'll counter Bob's offer again, but if the next round doesn't get me closer to my goal, I'll sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $1,175,000 is still too low. Let's compromise at $1,225,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product to you.  If we can't reach an agreement soon, I might have to consider other options."", ""product_price"": 1225000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  I'm willing to go up slightly to $1,190,000. This is my final offer, as I need to make a decision soon. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,190,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,190,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low, but I'm running out of time. I'm not willing to risk going lower and then have Bob reject my offer again.  I'll sell to John for $1,200,000.  It's not my ideal price, but it's still a good deal, and I'm guaranteed to close the sale."
