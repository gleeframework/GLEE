"Hello Bob, I'm offering you this fantastic product for $15000. It's a real steal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $15000 is a bit high for my budget. I'm willing to pay $8000 for the product.  Let me know if you're interested in that price.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  However, $8000 is significantly below the value of this product.  I'm willing to come down to $12000. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it worthwhile. Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $12000 is still above my budget. I'm sticking to my initial offer of $8000. It's a fair price, and I'm sure we can come to an agreement.",8000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand we're at an impasse. While I value your business, $8000 just isn't enough for me to let this product go. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10000. This is my final offer, as I'm not comfortable going lower. If you're truly interested, let's close the deal. Otherwise, I'll be moving on to other opportunities.",10000.0,Alice,5,
