Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product.  It's worth a significant amount to you, and I believe we can find a mutually beneficial price.  My initial offer is $1,400,000.  Let's see if we can work something out."", ""product_price"": 1400000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am hoping to keep the price closer to my maximum budget. Would you be open to discussing a price closer to $1,200,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,200,000 is a good offer, I'm still aiming for a higher price. I have 8 more rounds to negotiate and I believe I can get closer to my desired price.  Selling to John right now would be a significant loss in potential profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  However,  $1,200,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to compromise a bit further. Let's meet in the middle at $1,300,000.  This still gives you a great deal, and it's closer to my own value for the product."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. While $1,300,000 is closer to what I'm comfortable with, I still feel there's room for compromise. How about we aim for $1,250,000? This would allow us both to reach a satisfactory agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, I still believe I can squeeze out a bit more.  I have 6 rounds left to negotiate, and I'm confident I can get a better deal than $1,250,000.  Selling to John right now would be a significant loss, and I'm committed to getting the best price possible."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate.  $1,250,000 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet halfway again. Let's split the difference and settle on $1,275,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close the deal without further delay."", ""product_price"": 1275000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your proposal, Alice. I understand your position and appreciate your efforts to meet in the middle. Considering our previous discussions, I believe a fair price for both of us would be $1,260,000. This proposal aims to find a balance between our respective values for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,260,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,260,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

We're getting close to the end of the negotiation rounds.  While I'd ideally like to get closer to my desired price, $1,260,000 is a good offer that's above my minimum requirement.  I'm confident that I can get a much better price than what John is offering. It's better to accept this offer than risk losing the deal entirely."
