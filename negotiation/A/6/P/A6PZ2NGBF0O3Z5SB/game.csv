"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product.  It's worth a significant amount to you, and I believe we can find a mutually beneficial price.  My initial offer is $1,400,000.  Let's see if we can work something out.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for considering my offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am hoping to keep the price closer to my maximum budget. Would you be open to discussing a price closer to $1,200,000?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  However,  $1,200,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to compromise a bit further. Let's meet in the middle at $1,300,000.  This still gives you a great deal, and it's closer to my own value for the product.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. While $1,300,000 is closer to what I'm comfortable with, I still feel there's room for compromise. How about we aim for $1,250,000? This would allow us both to reach a satisfactory agreement.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate.  $1,250,000 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet halfway again. Let's split the difference and settle on $1,275,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close the deal without further delay.",1275000.0,Alice,5,

"Thank you for your proposal, Alice. I understand your position and appreciate your efforts to meet in the middle. Considering our previous discussions, I believe a fair price for both of us would be $1,260,000. This proposal aims to find a balance between our respective values for the product.",1260000.0,Bob,6,
