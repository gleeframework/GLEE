Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $800,000 is a good offer, Bob, but I'm not willing to sell it to you at that price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $825,000. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000

Alice is unlikely to go any lower, and this price is a good deal compared to John's offer.  It's time to accept and close the deal."
