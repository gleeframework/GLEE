"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a competitive price, and I believe it's a great starting point for our negotiation.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree your product is of high quality, the price point is a little high for me right now.  Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $850,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and quality.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway there.  To be honest, $800,000 is really the highest I can go. I think that's a very fair offer.",800000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $800,000 is a good offer, Bob, but I'm not willing to sell it to you at that price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $825,000. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",825000.0,Alice,5,
