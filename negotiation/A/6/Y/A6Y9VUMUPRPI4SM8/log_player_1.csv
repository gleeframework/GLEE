Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think it would be perfect for you! I'm offering it to you for $115. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 115}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I've set the price at $115, which is higher than Bob's perceived value of $100 but lower than my minimum acceptable price of $120. This gives me room to negotiate if Bob counteroffers.
* **Message:** I'm keeping the message friendly and encouraging, highlighting the potential value of the product for Bob. 

This approach aims to:

* **Maximize potential profit:** $115 is a good starting point to potentially earn more than John's offer of $120.
* **Encourage negotiation:** The message is open to discussion and invites Bob to counteroffer, giving me the opportunity to reach a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the product, but I was hoping to find something within my budget of $100. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $100 is my minimum acceptable price, I am not desperate to sell to Bob. I believe I can likely secure a better price through further negotiation.  Rejecting his offer allows me to:

* **Maintain leverage:**  By not accepting his offer immediately, I show that I am not desperate and I am willing to hold out for a better deal.
* **Explore potential counteroffers:** This allows me to see if Bob might be willing to increase his offer, especially if he really wants the product.
* **Secure the best deal:** By negotiating further, I have a greater chance of getting closer to my desired price.

**Next steps:**  I will now make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming to get a price closer to $115."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $100 is a little too low for me. How about $105? It's still a good price for a product of this quality."", ""product_price"": 105}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I've lowered my price from $115 to $105, demonstrating flexibility while still staying above my minimum acceptable price. This shows I'm open to negotiation but not desperate.
* **Message:** I reiterate my understanding of Bob's budget while emphasizing the value of the product. I also use a positive tone to keep the negotiation friendly. 

This counteroffer aims to:

* **Find a middle ground:**  $105 is a compromise that might appeal to Bob.
* **Maintain leverage:**  By not immediately accepting his $100 offer, I show I am not desperate to sell. 
* **Prepare for a potential final deal:**  If Bob accepts $105, I've secured a good price. If he counteroffers again, I'll have more information to make a final decision."
