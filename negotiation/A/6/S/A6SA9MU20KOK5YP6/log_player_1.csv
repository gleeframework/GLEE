Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price."", 
""product_price"": 119
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** We want to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($100) as possible while still exceeding our minimum price ($120).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $119 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially counter-offer, while still ensuring we get more than our minimum if he accepts. 
* **Alternative Buyer:** We have a guaranteed sale at $120 with John, so there's no pressure to go below that.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between attracting Bob and securing a profitable deal."
