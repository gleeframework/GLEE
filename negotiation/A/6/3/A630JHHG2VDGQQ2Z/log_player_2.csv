"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,700,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

The product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob, so paying $1,700,000 is not a good deal. It's better to reject Alice's offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

This counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still above the product's value to Bob. This shows that Bob is serious about buying the product, but also willing to negotiate. This strategy aims to create room for a deal that benefits both parties without losing out on the opportunity if Alice rejects the offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,550,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice's offer of $1,550,000 is within Bob's budget and only $50,000 more than what it's worth to him. It's a good compromise, especially considering that Bob could buy the product from John for $1,500,000. Further negotiation might lead to a lower price, but the risk of Alice rejecting the offer and losing the deal to John outweighs the potential savings."
