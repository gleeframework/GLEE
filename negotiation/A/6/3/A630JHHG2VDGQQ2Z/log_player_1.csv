Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1700000} 

I'm starting with a price of $1,700,000. This gives Bob a potential profit of $200,000, which is a reasonable incentive for him to consider. It also leaves room for negotiation if he counteroffers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Bob's offer is too low. It's worth more to me than that. I will reject his offer and counter with a new price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1550000}

I'm going to counter with $1,550,000. This is still a good profit for me, and it's closer to Bob's offer. I think it's a fair middle ground."
