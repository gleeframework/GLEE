"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a high price to leave room for negotiation and to potentially gauge Bob's interest. 
* **Ambitious target:**  $1,500,000 is a significant markup from my minimum value of $1,000,000. This reflects my desire to maximize profits.
* **Room for compromise:**  I anticipate Bob will counter with a lower price, and I'm prepared to negotiate within a reasonable range. 
* **Alternative option:** The knowledge that I can sell to John for $1,000,000 gives me a safety net and allows me to be more assertive in negotiations with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  While $1,000,000 is my minimum acceptable price, it's still significantly below the value I believe the product holds. Accepting his offer would be a substantial loss.
* **Negotiation is key:**  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to continue negotiating and potentially secure a better price. 
* **Time is on my side:** I have 8 rounds remaining, giving me ample opportunity to find a more favorable deal.
* **John is a backup:**  The option to sell to John for $1,000,000 provides a safety net if negotiations with Bob fall through."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm reducing my price from $1,500,000 to $1,250,000, showing flexibility and a willingness to compromise.
* **Maintain value:**  This price still allows me to gain a significant profit over my minimum value of $1,000,000. 
* **Test the waters:**  This offer will test Bob's seriousness and see if he's willing to meet me halfway. 
* **Time management:**  I'm keeping negotiations moving forward, avoiding any delays that could lead to a deal falling through."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** While $1,150,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still not a significant enough profit for the value I believe the product holds.
* **Negotiation potential:** Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to continue negotiations and potentially secure a price closer to my desired range. 
* **Rounds remaining:** I still have 6 rounds left, giving me ample time to reach a more favorable agreement.
* **John is a backup:** Selling to John for $1,000,000 is always an option, but I'm not ready to give up on achieving a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:**  This counteroffer splits the difference between my previous offer of $1,250,000 and Bob's offer of $1,150,000. This shows a genuine desire to reach a compromise. 
* **Reasonable profit:**  $1,200,000 still provides a substantial profit over my minimum value of $1,000,000.
* **Time pressure:** With 5 rounds remaining, it's important to keep the negotiations moving and show that I'm serious about closing the deal.
* **Gauging Bob's interest:** This counteroffer will gauge whether Bob is willing to meet me halfway or if he's determined to stick to his lower price."
