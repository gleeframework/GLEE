Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer slightly, aiming for a price that's still within my budget but closer to Alice's last offer. This shows that I'm serious about buying but also willing to walk away if necessary. This approach allows for further negotiation while keeping me within my price range."

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has finally met my budget, and it's a good price considering I have several rounds remaining. Accepting this offer allows me to secure the product without risking losing it to another buyer. Buying from John would be the same price, but accepting this offer keeps the negotiation open for potential future price adjustments or changes."
