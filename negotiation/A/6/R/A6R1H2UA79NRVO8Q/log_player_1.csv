Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm offering the product to Bob for $14,500. This is a good starting point, as it's above Bob's perceived value of $12,000, but still leaves room for negotiation.  It also gives me a good chance of earning a decent profit while still potentially closing the deal. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I'll also be prepared to walk away if necessary and sell to John for $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $13,000 is better than Bob's initial perceived value, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. I'll reject this offer and counter with a price closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

I'm countering Bob's offer with $14,000. This price is still above Bob's initial offer but closer to my desired value.  I'm hoping to reach a compromise, but I'm prepared to hold firm if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $13,500 is better than Bob's initial offer and getting closer to my desired value, I'm not convinced I'll be able to get a better price from Bob. It's getting late in the negotiation, and I don't want to risk losing out on a sure thing with John.  I'll accept John's offer and sell the product for $15,000."
