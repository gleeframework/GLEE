"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **$95 is too high for me.**  I'm willing to pay up to $100, but I want to save as much as possible.
* **Rejecting allows me to negotiate.**  By rejecting, I can make a counteroffer and potentially get a better price. 
* **John is a backup option.** If negotiations fail, I can always buy from John for $100."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting with a reasonable counteroffer:** $90 is a significant step down from Alice's initial offer, but it still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Showing willingness to compromise:**  This demonstrates that I'm serious about buying the product, but I'm also not willing to pay a price that's too high.
* **Leaving space for Alice to counter:** $90 allows Alice to potentially accept or make a counteroffer, keeping the negotiation moving."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $93. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $93
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is getting closer to my target:** $93 is a significant improvement from her initial offer of $95.
* **There's a risk of further negotiation:**  If I reject, Alice might counter with a price higher than $93, or we could reach a stalemate.
* **John's offer is a fallback:** If I can't reach an agreement with Alice, I can always buy from John. However, I'm willing to take a slight risk for a potentially lower price."
