"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $130 is a bit high, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can do $110, which is the lowest I can go. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",110.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice.  However, $110 is still a bit too steep for me.  Could you do $100?  That's the highest I can go.",100.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $110 was still a bit high for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go down to $100 as it's below my minimum acceptable price. I can offer you a compromise at $105. It's the lowest I can go, but I think it's still a great deal for you.",105.0,Alice,5,
