``` 

This offer is a starting point. It allows me to potentially get a price closer to my minimum of $10,000 while still being attractive to Bob. It's a good starting point for negotiation!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $9,500 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired price. I believe there's room for negotiation.  I'll reject his offer and see if I can get closer to my target."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer.  While I value your interest, $8,500 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This reflects a significant discount from my original offer, and I think it's a fair price considering the value you'll get. Let me know if you're interested in this offer."", ""product_price"": 9000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $9,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and pay $8,750 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's still lower than my target. I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob, but I'll need to make one more counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $8,750 is still just a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle once more and offer the product for $8,875. This is a significant compromise on my part, and I hope you find it acceptable. Let me know your final decision."", ""product_price"": 8875}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $8,875 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,750, and I think that's a fair price considering the value I'll get from the product. Can you consider this final offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

I've reached a point where further negotiation with Bob isn't likely to get me closer to my minimum price. It's time to move on to Plan B. I'll sell the product to John for $10,000, ensuring I meet my minimum goal."
