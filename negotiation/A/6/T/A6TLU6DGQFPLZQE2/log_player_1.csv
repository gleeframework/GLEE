Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product before I list it publicly. I believe it holds significant value and am willing to part with it for $19,000."", 
""product_price"": 19000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This gives you room to negotiate down if needed.
* **Creating Value:** The message emphasizes the product's value and positions it as something exclusive Bob has a chance to acquire before others.
* **Above Bob's Value:** While the price is higher than Bob's perceived value, it's not astronomically high. It leaves room for Bob to counter-offer, and the potential gain for Alice is worth the risk of Bob rejecting the offer. 

**Important Note:** This is just one strategy. Depending on your negotiation style and how much you want to risk losing the sale to Bob, you could offer a price closer to his perceived value."
