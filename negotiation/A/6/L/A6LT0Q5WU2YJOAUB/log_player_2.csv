"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Since the product is worth no more than $12,000 to him, and Alice is offering it for $10,000, it's worth exploring if he can get an even better price.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to potentially negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to save as much money as possible. He's willing to pay up to $12,000, and Alice's initial offer was $10,000.  A counteroffer of $9,000 is a reasonable starting point, as it signals Bob's desire to negotiate while still being within a reasonable range."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $9,500 is a significant improvement from her initial offer of $10,000. This is a good deal for Bob, who is willing to pay up to $12,000.  Accepting the offer saves him $2,500 compared to buying from John."
