"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $2000000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $1500000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting to go for the guaranteed $1,500,000, I believe there's room for negotiation. I'll try to get a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position. However, $1,500,000 doesn't quite cover my investment and the potential of this product. I'm willing to come down to $1,750,000. This reflects a significant reduction from my initial offer and allows for some flexibility. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1750000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but $1750000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1400000 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,400,000 is below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  At this point, it's not worth continuing to negotiate with Bob. I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,500,000."
