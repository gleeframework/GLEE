"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,200,000. This is a fair price that reflects the true value of the product.  I'm confident it will be a valuable asset to you.  Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

While Alice is offering the product at her own perceived value, there's no room for negotiation in her offer. Rejecting might lead her to propose a lower price, especially since you have John as a backup option at the same price."
