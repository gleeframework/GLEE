{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's worth a lot to me, so I'm starting with a price of $900,000.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 900000}

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price for the product, considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to try to get closer to my goal price.  While $750,000 is a decent offer, I'm not ready to accept it yet. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your offer.  However, $750,000 is a bit too low for me at this time. I'm willing to come down to $850,000.  This gives us both a good margin to work with.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm proposing a price of $800,000. I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

This is a great opportunity to close the deal at my minimum acceptable price.  I've already gotten close to my ideal selling price, and further negotiation might risk losing the sale completely."
