"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value of the product, $18,000 is significantly above my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,000 for it, which is still a good deal for you considering your value of $15,000. Let's see if we can find common ground.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm still looking to get a good price for the product. Considering its value to you is $8,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering it to you for $12,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects its worth to me. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the compromise, but $12,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $9,000, which is a significant increase from my initial offer.  This demonstrates my seriousness in wanting to purchase the product, and it also leaves some room for us to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",9000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $9,000. Considering its value to me is $15,000, I'm willing to meet you at $11,000. This is a compromise that still reflects its worth to me, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.
