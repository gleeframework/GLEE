"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this truly unique product.  Given its value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a starting price of $1,800,000. I'm open to discussing this further, but I believe this reflects its true worth.",1800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the product's potential, $1,800,000 is unfortunately above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000, which I believe is a fair value considering my needs.  Let's see if we can work something out.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I understand your perspective, the value of this product is truly unique and represents a significant opportunity. Let's meet in the middle, how about $1,400,000?",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand the product's value, but $1,400,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,200,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer.  Let's see if we can close the deal at this point.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to move closer to a fair price.  I'm open to finding a solution that works for both of us. How about we settle at $1,300,000? This is a final offer.",1300000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand this is your final offer, but $1,300,000 is still slightly outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,250,000. I believe this is a fair compromise, and I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement at this price.",1250000.0,Bob,6,
