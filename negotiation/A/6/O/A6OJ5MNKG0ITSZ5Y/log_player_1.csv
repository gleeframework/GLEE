Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, and I believe it's worth every penny. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $14,000, which is slightly above Bob's perceived value. This gives me room to negotiate downwards. 
* **Positive Framing:** The message emphasizes the value of the product and presents the offer as a good deal for Bob. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message encourages Bob to respond and start a conversation, allowing for potential counteroffers.
* **Backup Plan:**  By mentioning John, I'm subtly letting Bob know that I'm not desperate and have other options. This adds pressure for Bob to consider my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $13000. Would you be willing to meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Potential for Better Deal:** Even though Bob's counteroffer is closer to my desired price, I believe there's still room to negotiate. He's already shown interest and is willing to pay more than his initial assessment, indicating a potential for a higher price.
* **Maintaining Leverage:**  By rejecting his offer, I maintain leverage and show that I'm not desperate to sell at his price. This increases the chance of a better counteroffer from him in the next round.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** While selling to John for $15,000 is tempting, the potential for a higher offer from Bob justifies the risk of rejecting his counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $13,000 is still a bit lower than what I'm hoping for.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,500?  It's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 13500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise and Fairness:**  I'm proposing a compromise by meeting Bob halfway. This shows good faith and willingness to negotiate.
* **Reiterating Value:** I remind Bob of the product's value to reinforce the justification for a higher price.
* **Positive Framing:**  The message is still friendly and encourages a response, keeping the negotiation open. 

**Why not $14,000?** 

While I'd love to get $14,000, this counteroffer is a strategic move to demonstrate flexibility while still maintaining a price that's closer to my minimum. It also leaves room for potential further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $13500. Would you be willing to meet me at $13200? I think that's a fair price considering the value of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:**  Bob's offer of $13,200 is very close to my minimum price of $15,000. While it's tempting to continue negotiating, the risk of losing John's offer outweighs the potential gains from a small price increase.
* **Time and Effort:**  The negotiation has already taken several rounds, and there's no guarantee that Bob will budge further. The risk of continuing the negotiation and losing both buyers isn't worth the potential for a slightly higher price.
* **Guaranteed Profit:**  Selling to John guarantees a profit of $3,000, which is a significant amount. It's better to secure this profit than to risk getting nothing or a lower price by continuing the negotiation. 

**Conclusion:** 

While I would love to get closer to my ideal price, the current situation dictates that selling to John is the best option to maximize my profit and minimize risk."
