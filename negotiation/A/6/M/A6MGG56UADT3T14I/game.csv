"Hi Alice, thanks for offering this product. While I agree it looks like a great product, $20,000 is a bit outside my budget. Would you consider $11,000?",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $11,000 is a bit too low for me. Could you meet me halfway at $15,500?",15500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand we are not quite in agreement yet. While $15,500 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit high. How about we settle at $12,500?",12500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm trying to be flexible, but I can't go as low as $12,500.  Would you be willing to do $14,000?  It's a fair offer.",14000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $14,000 is still a bit much for my budget.  Would you consider $13,000? I think that's a fair compromise.",13000.0,Bob,6,
