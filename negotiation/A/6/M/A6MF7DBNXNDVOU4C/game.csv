"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this unique product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to start with a price of $12,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you is $15,000, and I'm confident you'll find it worth every penny.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you starting the negotiation. However, $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product.  This is a fair price considering your value for it and my budget. Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking to save a bit, Bob. I appreciate your honesty. However, I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal for myself. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my minimum of $12,000. How about we meet at $11,500? It's a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you and my target price.",11500.0,Alice,3,
