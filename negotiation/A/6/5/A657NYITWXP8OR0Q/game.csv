"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I'm interested, $20,000 is a bit out of my range.  I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product.  What do you think?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but $12,000 is quite a bit lower than I'm hoping for. How about we meet in the middle at $17,000?",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $17,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm really serious about this product, and I'm willing to go up to $14,000. This is a fair price, and I'm confident we can both be happy with the deal.",14000.0,Bob,4,
