"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000

The product is worth no more than $1,000,000 to Bob, so accepting Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is not a good option. Buying from John for $1,000,000 is a better option, but there's a chance to get an even better price by negotiating with Alice.  Therefore, the best course of action is to reject Alice's offer and make a counteroffer."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial one, it's still above Bob's maximum value. It's worth continuing to negotiate with Alice to potentially get a better price.  There's a chance she might be willing to go lower to close the deal."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

``` 

Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's maximum value, but it's still $50,000 higher. There's a chance she might continue to lower the price, but there's also a risk she won't go lower, and Bob will be stuck with a price he doesn't want to pay.  Buying from John for $1,000,000 is a guaranteed deal and the best option at this point."
