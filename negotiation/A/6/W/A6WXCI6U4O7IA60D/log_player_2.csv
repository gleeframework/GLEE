"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $20000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to me is at least $15000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than Bob's maximum budget of $12,000.  It's in Bob's best interest to reject and try to negotiate a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $10000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $18000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to me. Let me know if this is something you're interested in.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above Bob's maximum budget of $12,000.  While it's closer, it's still too high. Bob can try to negotiate further, but it's important to keep in mind that there's always the option to buy from John for a guaranteed $12,000."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $15000 is a good offer, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell it to you for $17000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to me. Let me know if this is something you're interested in.

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $17,000 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $12,000.  While it's getting closer, it's still too high.  At this point, Bob should accept the guaranteed lower price from John to ensure he doesn't overspend."
