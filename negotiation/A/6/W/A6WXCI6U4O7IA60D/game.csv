"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $20000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to me is at least $15000. What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20000 is a bit out of my range. Considering the value I'm looking for, I'm willing to pay $10000.  Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $10000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $18000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to me. Let me know if this is something you're interested in.",18000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $18000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm happy to pay $15000, which is a good deal for both of us.  Let's see if we can agree on that.",15000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $15000 is a good offer, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell it to you for $17000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to me. Let me know if this is something you're interested in.",17000.0,Alice,5,
