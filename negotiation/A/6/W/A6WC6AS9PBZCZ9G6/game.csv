"Hi Bob, I'm happy to discuss selling you this product. I believe it holds significant value and can be a real asset to you.  To start the conversation, I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000. I'm open to hearing your thoughts.",1350000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,350,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the offer and your perspective on the value.  While $1,100,000 is a bit too low for me to consider, I'm motivated to find a deal that works for both of us. How about we meet in the middle at $1,225,000?",1225000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  I'm still a bit hesitant at $1,225,000.  Let's split the difference and settle on $1,162,500. This would be a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident the product will be a great asset to my business.",1162500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate and find a compromise. While $1,162,500 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still looking for a slightly higher number. To be completely transparent, I have another buyer interested at a higher price point. However, I value our discussions and would prefer to work with you if possible.  Would you be willing to consider $1,195,000?  This is my final offer, as I need to make a decision soon.",1195000.0,Alice,5,
