This offer is a good starting point. It's above Bob's perceived value, giving him room to negotiate, but still significantly lower than your minimum acceptable price. This allows for a potential compromise while maximizing your profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

While $1,100,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still below what I'm willing to accept. I'll counter with a higher price to see if we can find a middle ground before resorting to selling to John."

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm not willing to sell for less than $1,150,000. I'll make a final counteroffer before considering selling to John."

Bob's offer is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. I've already made multiple concessions and it seems like we're at an impasse. It's time to move on to John, who's willing to pay my asking price."
