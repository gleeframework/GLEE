"Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $1,080,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,125,000 as a final compromise.  This is a fair price for both of us, considering the product's value to you. If you're not willing to meet me halfway at this price, I'll have to move on to another buyer.",1125000.0,Alice,5,
