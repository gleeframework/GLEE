Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering the significant returns you'll see.  What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Since John offers the full value, there's no risk in starting with a price closer to your desired outcome.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** A starting price of $1,300,000 allows for some negotiation downwards while still remaining significantly above Bob's perceived value. 
* **Justifying the Price:** Highlighting the ""value and potential"" aims to frame the price in a positive light and potentially shift Bob's perception of its worth. 

This strategy aims to maximize potential profit while still offering Bob a seemingly reasonable deal compared to your guaranteed alternative."
