**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While Alice's offer is lower than the product's worth to her, it's still above Bob's maximum budget.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $1,050,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll counter with a price of $1,100,000. This is a fair compromise that should be acceptable to both of us.

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming to save as much money as possible. While Alice's new offer is lower than her initial offer, it's still higher than Bob's ideal price. He can try to negotiate further and potentially get a better deal."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad we're close to reaching an agreement. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $1,075,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'll counter with a price of $1,087,500. This is my final offer, and I hope we can wrap up the deal at this price.

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer of $1,087,500 is closer to Bob's ideal price, it's still higher than what he could get from John for $1,000,000.  In this case, it's more beneficial for Bob to buy the product from John and save the additional $87,500."
