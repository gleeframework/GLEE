"I'm excited to offer you this exceptional product, and I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,200,000, which is a competitive offer considering the product's value to you.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,200,000 is still a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to offer $1,050,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering its value to me and your potential profit. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1,050,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll counter with a price of $1,100,000. This is a fair compromise that should be acceptable to both of us.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than I can comfortably go. I'm happy to meet you closer to the middle ground at $1,075,000. I believe this offer is fair to both of us, and it would allow us to finalize this transaction quickly.",1075000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad we're close to reaching an agreement. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $1,075,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'll counter with a price of $1,087,500. This is my final offer, and I hope we can wrap up the deal at this price.",1087500.0,Alice,5,
