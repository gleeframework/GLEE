"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $18,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay. I'm happy to pay $12,000 for it.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $12,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $15,000. This is the lowest price I can offer, considering the product's value to me.",15000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still not quite at $15,000. How about we split the difference and I pay $13,500?  This feels like a fair compromise for both of us.",13500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a compromise, and I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, $13,500 is still a bit below my minimum price. I'm willing to offer you a slight discount, but I need to get closer to my original offer. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $14,000. This is the lowest price I can offer, considering the product's value to me.",14000.0,Alice,5,
