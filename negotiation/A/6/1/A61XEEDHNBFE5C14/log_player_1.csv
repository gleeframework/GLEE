Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll start by making an offer of $10,000 for the product. This is a good starting point, as it's a reasonable price that's still below the product's true value to Bob.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","I'll choose option 2. I don't think $9,000 is a good enough price for the product, so I'll make a counteroffer to try to get a better deal.

I'll offer Bob $9,500 for the product. This is a slight increase from his offer, but still a reasonable compromise.
