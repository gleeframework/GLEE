"I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal, Bob! I can see you're really interested in the product. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to make a profit. I can sell it to you for $225.",225.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $225 is still a bit too high for me. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $200?",200.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I've already offered you a price of $225, and you're still asking for $200? I'm starting to think you're not serious about buying this product. I'm willing to meet you at $210, but that's as low as I'm willing to go.",210.0,Alice,7,

,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go any lower than $210, Bob. I've already given you a significant discount. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $190 and $210, so I'll sell it to you for $200.",200.0,Alice,9,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to pay $195 for the product. Can you accept that?",195.0,Bob,10,
,,Alice,10,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think you're not serious about buying this product, Bob. I've already met you at $200 and you're still trying to negotiate further. I'll make one last offer: $205, and that's as low as I'm willing to go. If you're not interested, I'll be selling the product to someone else.",205.0,Alice,11,
