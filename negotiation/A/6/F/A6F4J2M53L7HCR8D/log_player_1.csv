"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point as it is:

* **Higher than Bob's value:** This gives Bob room to negotiate and feel like he's getting a good deal. 
* **Lower than your minimum:** This ensures you're still making a profit.
* **Reasonably high:** This doesn't give away too much value in the first round. 

By sending a message along with the price, I'm establishing a more personal connection with Bob and setting a positive tone for the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,500. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is below my minimum price of $15,000.  While it's tempting to accept and close the deal quickly, I want to see if I can get closer to my target price. I have 9 more rounds, and there's still potential for a better deal.  Rejecting his offer allows me to make a counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your offer.  I'm willing to come down to $13,500, which is still a fair price given the value of the product.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving towards a middle ground:** This counteroffer is closer to Bob's offer, demonstrating my willingness to compromise.  
* **Still above my minimum:**  $13,500 is still above my minimum price of $15,000, ensuring I make a decent profit. 
* **Maintaining a positive tone:** The message remains friendly and focuses on finding a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your counteroffer. I'm still a bit above my budget, so I was thinking more along the lines of $12,800. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. While it's getting closer, I'm not ready to accept it yet. I have several more rounds to negotiate, and I'm confident that I can get a better deal. By rejecting Bob's offer, I can make a counteroffer and try to bridge the gap between our positions."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see we're getting closer. I'm willing to go down to $13,200, but that's as low as I can go. This price still reflects the true value of the product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 13200}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** This counteroffer is exactly halfway between my previous offer of $13,500 and Bob's offer of $12,800. This demonstrates flexibility and willingness to compromise.
* **Still profitable:**  $13,200 is still above my minimum price of $15,000, ensuring I make a profit. 
* **Adding a touch of urgency:** The message hints that this is my final offer, creating a sense of urgency for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $12,900. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,900
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum of $15,000. I've made significant concessions already, and I'm not ready to settle for a price that doesn't reflect the product's worth. I have several rounds left, and I'm optimistic that we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm starting to feel like we're not going to be able to reach an agreement. I'm willing to come down to $13,000 as a final compromise, but I won't go any lower. This is a fair price, considering the value of the product. Let me know if you're interested, otherwise, I'll need to move on to other options."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final offer:** This is my final counteroffer, putting pressure on Bob to accept or reject.
* **Small concession:**  I'm only decreasing the price by $200, showing that I'm not willing to give up much more.
* **Introducing an ultimatum:** The message implies that if Bob doesn't accept this offer, I will move on to other buyers. This creates urgency and a sense of potential loss for Bob.
* **Emphasizing value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to emphasize the fairness of my offer."
