"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I'm confident this is a fair starting point for a mutually beneficial agreement.",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,100,000 is a bit high for me. I'm interested in the product, but my budget is closer to $800,000. To make this work, I'm willing to offer $900,000. Let's see if we can bridge the gap.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you taking the time to consider my initial offer and for presenting your counter-proposal.  While $900,000 is a significant investment, the true value of this product is considerably higher.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,050,000.  I believe this price reflects the inherent worth of the product while still providing significant value for your investment.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, $1,050,000 is still a bit above my budget.  I'm feeling $950,000 is a fair compromise that acknowledges the value of the product while remaining within my financial constraints.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement at this price.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting closer. I recognize you're serious about this purchase, and I want to find a solution that works for both of us. Let's settle this at $1,000,000. This price acknowledges the value proposition while hopefully fitting within your budget.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $1,000,000 is still a little more than I'm comfortable with.  I understand the value of the product, but I'm really pushing the limits of my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $975,000.  This is a significant increase from my previous offer, and I truly believe it's a fair compromise.",975000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. This is my final offer, let's close this deal at $990,000.  This is a significant discount from my original asking price and reflects my desire to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",990000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I understand this is your final offer, but $990,000 is still a bit too high for me. To finalize this deal, I'm willing to go up to $980,000. This is a significant compromise, and I hope we can close the deal at this price.",980000.0,Bob,8,
