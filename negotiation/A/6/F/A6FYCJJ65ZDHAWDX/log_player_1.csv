"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,100,000 is a bit high for me. I'm interested in the product, but my budget is closer to $800,000. To make this work, I'm willing to offer $900,000. Let's see if we can bridge the gap. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you taking the time to consider my initial offer and for presenting your counter-proposal.  While $900,000 is a significant investment, the true value of this product is considerably higher.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,050,000.  I believe this price reflects the inherent worth of the product while still providing significant value for your investment."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, $1,050,000 is still a bit above my budget.  I'm feeling $950,000 is a fair compromise that acknowledges the value of the product while remaining within my financial constraints.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000

Round 5

{
""message"": ""Bob, we're getting closer. I recognize you're serious about this purchase, and I want to find a solution that works for both of us. Let's settle this at $1,000,000. This price acknowledges the value proposition while hopefully fitting within your budget."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  $1,000,000 is still a little more than I'm comfortable with.  I understand the value of the product, but I'm really pushing the limits of my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $975,000.  This is a significant increase from my previous offer, and I truly believe it's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000

We are getting very close to John's offer, but there's still potential for a better deal with Bob before accepting John's offer."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  I understand this is your final offer, but $990,000 is still a bit too high for me. To finalize this deal, I'm willing to go up to $980,000. This is a significant compromise, and I hope we can close the deal at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $980,000

Bob is unlikely to significantly increase his offer. Accepting his current offer would mean losing out on a significant amount compared to John's offer.  It's time to move on to the guaranteed deal with John."
