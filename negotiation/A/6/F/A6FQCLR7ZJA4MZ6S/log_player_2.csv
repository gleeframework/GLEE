# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000.  It's a significant value to you, and I'm confident we can reach a deal that benefits both of us.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

**Reasoning:**

While $1,200,000 is a good price, it's still above your ideal range. There's room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better deal."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1,000,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000 to finalize this deal.  This price still provides you with a considerable profit, and I believe it's a fair compromise.  Let's make this happen.
