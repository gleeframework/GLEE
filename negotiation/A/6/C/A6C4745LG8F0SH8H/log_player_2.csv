"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject the offer. He can get the product for $1,000,000 from John, so there's no reason to accept a higher price.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. He knows he can get the product for $1,000,000 from John, so he should offer Alice the same price.  This is the lowest possible price he's willing to pay.  It's unlikely Alice will accept this offer on the first try, but it sets the stage for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $1,100,000 is closer to Bob's target price, it's still higher than what he can get from John.  It's worth continuing to negotiate with Alice to see if she'll come down further. There are still 7 rounds left, so Bob has time to try and reach a better agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is still trying to get the best possible price. He knows he can get the product for $1,000,000 from John, so he's offering a price slightly higher than that, hoping to find a middle ground with Alice. This offer shows he's willing to negotiate, but still wants to save a significant amount of money."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,080,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's target price, it's still higher than what he can get from John.  Bob is already saving money by negotiating with Alice, but there's still potential to save even more. It's worth continuing to negotiate with Alice for a few more rounds to see if she'll come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1020000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is getting closer to his target price with each round. He's offering a price that's only $20,000 more than what he can get from John.  This shows Alice that he's serious about buying the product but is also determined to get a good deal. There are still a few rounds left, so Bob can continue to negotiate, but he's starting to feel the pressure to reach an agreement before he runs out of time."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,060,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's target price, there are only 3 rounds left, and Bob still has a chance to get the product for $1,000,000 from John.  It's worth taking another round to try and negotiate a lower price with Alice. There's a chance she might be willing to accept a counteroffer close to his target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1010000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is getting closer to his target price and is willing to pay a little more than John's price. This counteroffer is a  last attempt to get a better price from Alice before he runs out of time and has to buy from John. There are only two rounds left, so it's important to make a strong offer and see if Alice will accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,040,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,040,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

There is only one round left, and Alice's offer is still $40,000 higher than what Bob can get from John.  It's not worth risking another round of negotiation.  At this point, Bob is better off buying the product from John for $1,000,000 to ensure he gets the product within his budget and before time runs out."
