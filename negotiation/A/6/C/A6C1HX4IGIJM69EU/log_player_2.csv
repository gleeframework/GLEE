"Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","I will reject Alice's offer because I can buy the product from John for $12,000, which is only $500 more than Alice's offer. Since I want to save as much money as possible, I will reject Alice's offer and buy the product from John.
