"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. This is a great deal, considering it's worth at least $15,000 to me. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $14,000 is better than Alice's initial asking price, it's still above your maximum budget.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and negotiate a lower price."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position. I'm willing to come down to $13,000. It's still a good price for you, as it's below my minimum asking price, but it also allows me to get closer to my desired value.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.

Alice has come down to $13,000, which is still within my budget, and closer to my target price. It's a good deal considering the product's value to Alice and my goal of saving money.  Accepting this offer avoids further negotiation and potential delays."
