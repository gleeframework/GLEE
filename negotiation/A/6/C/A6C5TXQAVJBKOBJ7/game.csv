"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to part with it for $1800000. What do you think?",1800000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1800000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1200000 for the product, which is still a fair price considering its potential value.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your honesty about your budget. However, I was really hoping to get closer to the original price I had in mind. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1600000. It's a great compromise, and I think it's still a fair price for this incredible product. What do you think?",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're trying to get a good price for the product, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1600000 is still out of my price range.  I'm willing to go up to $1400000.  This is a fair offer that reflects the value of the product and my budget. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1400000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $1400000 is your maximum budget, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession to try to reach an agreement. I'm willing to sell the product for $1520000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great value for the product. What do you think?",1520000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility and willingness to negotiate. I'm still not quite there on the price. I'm willing to offer $1450000 for the product. This is a fair compromise that reflects the value of the product and my budget. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1450000.0,Bob,6,
