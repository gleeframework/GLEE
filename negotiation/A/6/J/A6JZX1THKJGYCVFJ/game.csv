"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested in the product, but $13,000 is a bit out of my range.  I'm willing to pay $11,000 for it.  What do you think?",11000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $13,000 might be a bit steep for you. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $12,500. This is a great compromise that still reflects the value of the product.",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $12,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm confident that we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $12,000? That's the absolute most I can offer at this point.",12000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $12,400. This is the lowest price I'm comfortable with, considering the value the product brings to you. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for my product.",12400.0,Alice,5,
