"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value, I'm proposing a starting price of $14,000. I think it's a fair offer considering the benefits it will bring to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  You're willing to pay up to $15,000, but $14,000 is still too close to that limit. 
* **There's room for negotiation.** You have 10 rounds, and Alice is clearly motivated to sell (her value is $12,000).  
* **Rejecting allows for a counteroffer.** You can try to get a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate the value you're highlighting in the product.  However, I'm hoping to get a better price.  I'm willing to pay $13,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find a deal that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Counteroffer:**  A $1,000 reduction from Alice's initial price shows you're serious about negotiating and willing to compromise.
* **Reasonable Starting Point:**  $13,000 still leaves room for further negotiation, but it's a price you're comfortable with.
* **Positive Tone:**  The message is polite and emphasizes finding a mutually beneficial solution. This helps maintain a good rapport with Alice, which can be helpful during negotiations."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I understand you're looking for a good deal. How about we meet in the middle at $13,500? This price reflects the true value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Middle Ground:** Alice has moved closer to your offer, meeting you halfway at $13,500. This shows she's willing to negotiate.
* **Acceptable Price:** While it's not the absolute lowest you could get, it's still within your budget and a good compromise.
* **Avoiding Further Delays:**  Continuing to negotiate could take more time, and there's always a risk of Alice getting less flexible or you running out of rounds. 

Accepting this offer saves you $1,500 compared to buying from John, making it a good deal."
