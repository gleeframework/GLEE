**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:** Alice is offering the product for $12,000, while John wants $15,000.
* **The offer is within Bob's budget:** Bob is willing to spend up to $15,000, and Alice's offer is below that limit. 

Therefore, it makes sense for Bob to accept Alice's offer and save $3,000."
