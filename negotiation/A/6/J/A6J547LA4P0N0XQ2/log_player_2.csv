"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be perfect for you and I'm willing to part with it for $14,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $14,000 is less than what John is selling for, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a better price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $14,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  I'd be happy to pay $13,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer. This shows that he is serious about saving money and is willing to negotiate. $13,000 is still within his budget, and it leaves some room for Alice to counter while still making a profit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While I believe this product is worth every bit of $14,000, I understand your position. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $13,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming to save as much as possible. While $13,500 is better than Alice's original offer, it's still higher than what Bob is willing to pay at this point. He can try to negotiate further and get a lower price.  Rejecting the offer gives him the opportunity to make another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $13,500 is still a little high for me.  How about we settle at $13,250?  This feels like a fair price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 13250}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is continuing to chip away at the price, showing he's willing to negotiate.  $13,250 is a compromise - a small jump from his last offer but still leaving room for Alice to make a profit. This shows his commitment to finding a price that works for both parties."
