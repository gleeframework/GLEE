,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $9,000 is a bit out of my budget. How about $7,500? I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget.",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $7,500 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $8,500. That's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $8,500 is still a bit high for me, but I'm willing to go up to $8,250.  That's a good compromise and hopefully we can reach an agreement.",8250.0,Bob,4,
