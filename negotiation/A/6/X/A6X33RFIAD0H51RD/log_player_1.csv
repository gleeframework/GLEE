Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm suggesting a price of $1,500,000. I believe this is reflective of the significant return on investment you'll see."",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since we know Bob values the product at $1,200,000 and it's worth the same to us if we sell to John, we can start with a higher asking price. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.
* **Justification:** By highlighting the ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""significant return on investment,"" we aim to frame the price as justified by the product's value, rather than just a random high number.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  While we've set the price high, it's important to appear open to negotiation. This makes Bob feel more in control and increases the chance of a successful sale, even if it's slightly below our initial ask."
