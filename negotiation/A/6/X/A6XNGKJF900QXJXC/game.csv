"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1500000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm very interested in the product, but I can only offer $800000 at this time. Let me know what you think.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $800000 is a significant amount, but I'm still looking to get a better price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1200000. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down in price, but $1200000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm happy to go up to $900000. This is my final offer, and I'm prepared to walk away if we can't reach an agreement.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're willing to go up to $900000, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $1100000. This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,5,
