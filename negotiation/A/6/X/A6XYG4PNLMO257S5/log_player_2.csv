"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which is tailored to meet your specific needs. We believe it could significantly enhance your operations and increase your efficiency. Considering its value to you, we propose a price of $1,300,000. Let me know if this aligns with your budget or if you'd like to discuss further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $1,300,000 is within his budget, it's still higher than what he's willing to pay. By rejecting the offer, Bob can start negotiating and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer. While I see the value in your product, $1,300,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm happy to pay $1,250,000 for it, reflecting the potential benefits it offers. This price is fair for both of us, and I'm confident it will lead to a mutually beneficial partnership. Let's close this deal! "", ""product_price"": 1250000}
