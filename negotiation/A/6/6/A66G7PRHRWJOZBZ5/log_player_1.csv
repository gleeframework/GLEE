"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the chance to own this incredible product. Given its value and potential, I'm offering it at $1,500,000."", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
```

**Reasoning:** 

Since I know the product is worth $1,000,000 to Bob, starting with a significantly higher offer allows room for negotiation while aiming for a maximum profit.  This strategy establishes a strong initial position and gives me leverage in subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,500,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product, which is a fair price given my own assessment of its value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:** 

While Bob's offer matches what John is willing to pay, it's too early to settle. I started high, aiming to create room for negotiation. I'll counter with a slightly lower price but still above my minimum to encourage a deal with Bob while aiming for a higher profit margin."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This price reflects the true value of the product."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm lowering my price significantly to show flexibility but keeping it well above Bob's offer and my minimum. This signals that I'm willing to negotiate but still aim for a price that reflects the product's value and yields a substantial profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,300,000 is still too high. I'm firm on my initial offer of $1,000,000. I believe this price reflects the value of the product while remaining within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:** 

Bob is holding firm at his initial offer, but I still have room to negotiate and several rounds left. Accepting his offer now would mean losing out on potential profit. I'll make another counteroffer, moving closer to his price but still aiming higher than his $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position.  Let's make this work. How about $1,150,000? This is a significant price reduction, and I believe it's a fair deal for both of us."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm making a more substantial concession to signal my willingness to reach an agreement. By offering $1,150,000, I'm splitting the difference between my previous offer and his firm price. This shows flexibility while still aiming for a significantly higher profit than accepting his $1,000,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your efforts to find a compromise, but $1,150,000 is still a bit too high. I'm willing to go up to $1,050,000. This would be a good deal for both of us, allowing you to get a reasonable price while keeping me within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:** 

Bob has finally increased his offer, showing a willingness to compromise. While I could push for a slightly higher price, accepting his offer of $1,050,000 secures a $50,000 profit over John's guaranteed offer. It's a reasonable deal at this stage of the negotiation and avoids the risk of Bob walking away in later rounds."
