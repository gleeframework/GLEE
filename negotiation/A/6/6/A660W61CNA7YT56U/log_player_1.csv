Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me.  I'm interested, but I could only go as high as $60. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: It seems like we're still pretty far apart on price, Alice.  I'd be willing to go up to $70, but I can't justify anything higher.

Round 5

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand that $70 isn't ideal for you.  Would you consider $80?  That's the absolute highest I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

**Reasoning:**

Bob has shown he's unwilling to go much higher than his initial offer.  While you could continue negotiating, it's unlikely you'll bridge the gap to a price that's significantly better than John's guaranteed offer of $150. It's time to cut your losses and secure the sure sale."
