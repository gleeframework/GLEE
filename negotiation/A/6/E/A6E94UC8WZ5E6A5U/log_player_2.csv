Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,400,000 is still significantly below my bottom line for this product.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you're firm on your price, but $1,700,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $1,500,000 for this product.

If you're not able to accept this offer, I will unfortunately have to move forward with another option."", ""product_price"": 1500000}
