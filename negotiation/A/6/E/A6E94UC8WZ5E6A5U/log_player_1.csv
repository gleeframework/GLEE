Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $2,000,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for this product, given its value to me. I believe this is a fair price that allows for both of us to benefit from this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're firm on your price, but $1,700,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $1,500,000 for this product. This is a serious offer, and I believe it reflects a fair compromise for both of us. If you're not able to accept this offer, I will unfortunately have to move forward with another option. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000

Bob is now willing to meet your baseline price. There is no guarantee he will go higher, and you have another buyer at that price.  Accepting Bob's offer ensures you get the best possible outcome in this situation."
