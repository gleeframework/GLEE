Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I know you're interested in. I'm asking for $100 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 
 
This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than your minimum:** $100 is more than your minimum of $80. 
* **It's lower than the product's value to Bob:**  This gives Bob room to negotiate while still allowing you to make a good profit.
* **It's a clear and concise message:**  It's straightforward and gives Bob a clear understanding of the offer.

This approach balances your desire to earn as much as possible with the need to make a deal that Bob might be willing to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $100 feels a bit high. Would you consider $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $85 is close to your minimum acceptable price, it's still worth trying to get closer to your initial offer of $100.  By rejecting Bob's counteroffer, you can:

* **Signal your willingness to negotiate:** This shows Bob that you're not just going to accept the first offer.
* **Potentially get a higher price:** With a counteroffer, you can try to meet halfway or propose a price closer to your initial ask.

**Next Steps:**

You'll need to make a counteroffer to Bob in the next round. Consider offering something like $90 or $95, explaining that you're willing to compromise but still need to make a fair profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. $85 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $92.50.  That's a fair price for both of us, I think. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 92.50}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:**  This counteroffer is exactly halfway between your previous offer of $100 and Bob's offer of $85. 
* **Signaling flexibility:** This shows Bob that you're serious about making a deal, but you're also not willing to give up too much.
* **Positive framing:**  The message emphasizes fairness and a win-win scenario for both parties.

This counteroffer balances your desire to get a higher price with the need to keep the negotiation moving towards a successful conclusion."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're looking for a price closer to $90, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $88? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $88. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $88
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $88 is still lower than what I'd initially hoped for, it's only $2 away from my minimum acceptable price of $80.  It's also a good sign that Bob is willing to negotiate and meet in the middle.  The potential risks of rejecting his offer and trying for a higher price are too high:

* **Time:**  Continuing to negotiate could take more time, and I might not be able to get a significantly higher price.
* **John:**  I could risk losing the deal with Bob completely and having to sell to John for $80.
* **Compromise:**  It's important to be reasonable and recognize that meeting in the middle is a fair outcome in this situation.

By accepting Bob's offer, I'm securing a deal that is close to my minimum acceptable price and allows me to move on without further negotiation."
