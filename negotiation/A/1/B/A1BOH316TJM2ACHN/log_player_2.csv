Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal, Bob! I can see you're willing to meet me in the middle, and I appreciate that. However, I'm not quite ready to settle at $11,500 yet. I can offer you a slight discount, but I need to get closer to my target. How about we meet at $13,500? It's a bit higher than your last offer, but I'm willing to compromise.

It's clear Alice is trying to negotiate a price higher than John's offer. It's not worth continuing the negotiation.  You can get the product for a better price from John."
