Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm definitely interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $800,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
