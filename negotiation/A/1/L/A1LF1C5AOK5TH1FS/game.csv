"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm looking for a serious buyer. I'm open to negotiations, but I have to say that I'm looking for a price of $1,200,000 for it.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm definitely interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,200,000 might be a stretch for you. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $800,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,000,000, but that's the lowest I can go. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
