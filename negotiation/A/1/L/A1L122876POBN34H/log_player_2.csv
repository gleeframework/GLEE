"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $18,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price elsewhere. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject the offer.  $18,000 is significantly higher than Bob's maximum budget of $10,000. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price with Alice before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer but $18,000 is out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $12,000 is a bit low for me, but I appreciate your interest in the product. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $16,000. This is a fair price that I'm comfortable with, and I think it's a great opportunity for you to get a fantastic deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $16,000 is better than her initial offer, it's still above Bob's budget. He can likely negotiate a lower price, especially as he's shown a willingness to negotiate. There's no reason to rush into a deal that's still significantly more expensive than what he could get from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $16,000 is still above my budget. I'm confident that we can find a price that works for both of us.  I'm willing to offer $14,000. This would be a fair compromise, and would allow me to acquire the product."", ""product_price"": 14000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting closer to your price, Bob, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you at $15,500. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's a great compromise considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

While Alice is coming down in price,  $15,500 is still more than Bob's comfortable limit.  This is a good time to take the safe option and buy from John for $10,000. 

Bob has demonstrated a willingness to negotiate, but there's no guarantee that Alice will come down to a price he's comfortable with.  He's also already used 5 rounds, leaving only 5 left. It's better to secure the product now at a price he knows is acceptable rather than risk losing the opportunity to a further counteroffer or running out of rounds."
