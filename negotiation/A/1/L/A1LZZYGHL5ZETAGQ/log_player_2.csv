"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is way above your maximum budget of $1,000,000.  It's not even worth negotiating with her at this point. You should reject her offer and go straight to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with my maximum budget. It's highly unlikely Alice will accept this, but it's a good starting point to see if she's willing to negotiate at all."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is still higher than my maximum budget of $1,000,000. While it's closer than her first offer, I'm still better off rejecting and trying to negotiate further. There's still a chance she might come down to my acceptable price range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly from $1,000,000 to $1,100,000. This shows Alice I'm serious about buying the product, but I'm still trying to stay within a reasonable price range.  Hopefully, this will encourage her to come down a bit more."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice is coming down in price, but she's still not within my comfortable range.  Since I have a guaranteed alternative with John at $1,000,000, it's time to cut my losses and secure the product.  Further negotiation with Alice might result in a lower price, but there's no guarantee.  It's better to go with the sure thing."
