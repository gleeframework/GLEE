Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 

This offer is above Bob's perceived value of the product, but it's still below your minimum acceptable price. It leaves room for negotiation and allows you to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is far too low.  While it's tempting to accept and get the deal done, it's not worth sacrificing such a large portion of the product's value. There's still room for negotiation, and a counteroffer might get Bob closer to a more acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

This counteroffer is a significant step down from your initial offer, but it's still above Bob's initial offer. This demonstrates your willingness to compromise while still holding out for a price that is more in line with the product's value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still not a good deal. There is a significant difference between his offer and what the product is worth to me.  I'm willing to continue negotiating, and I believe another counteroffer can get him closer to a more acceptable price."

I'm willing to lower my price slightly more to show my flexibility.  However, $1,200,000 is still a good price for Bob, considering he values it at $1,000,000. I'm hoping this will be enough to seal the deal."
