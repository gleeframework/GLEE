"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product I think you'd be interested in. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm open to negotiation.  How about we start with $15,000? Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 15000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer Alice, but $15000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in this product but I'm only willing to go up to $8000. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $8,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly less than my minimum value of $10,000. I'm willing to risk continuing the negotiation with Bob, hoping for a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $12,000? I believe this is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $12000 is still a bit high for me, but I'm willing to go up to $9500. Let's see if we can make this work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $9,500 is getting closer to my minimum value of $10,000, but it's still not enough. I'm willing to take the risk of another round of negotiation. I believe I can push for a slightly higher price and potentially get closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your effort, but $9,500 is still just a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $10,750?  This reflects the value of the product and allows for some flexibility. Let's try to close this deal."", ""product_price"": 10750}
