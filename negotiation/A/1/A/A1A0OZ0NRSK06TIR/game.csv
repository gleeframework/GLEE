"Hello Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand your perspective, but I'm still confident that the product's value to you is higher. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $950,000. This is a compromise that still benefits both of us. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm still not willing to go below $925,000. This is the minimum I'm comfortable with, considering the product's true value to you. I'm willing to meet you at $900,000, but that's as low as I can go. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,5,
