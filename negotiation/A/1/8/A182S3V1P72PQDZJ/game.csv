"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $11500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $12500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you say?",12500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, but $12500 is still a bit high for me. I'm confident we can find a middle ground. I'm willing to pay $12000, which is my absolute maximum. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to finalize the deal.",12000.0,Bob,4,
