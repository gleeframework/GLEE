"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm initially offering it at $1,000,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and potential.",1000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's worth less than $1,000,000. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $700,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value proposition.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  However, the product's inherent value and potential warrant a higher price.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the significant benefits it offers.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $900,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $850,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price for the product's value.",850000.0,Bob,4,
