"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $175.  It's a great deal for a high-quality item. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum, hoping to leave room for negotiation.  I'm also emphasizing the value of the product to try and incentivize Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice,  $175 is a bit too high for me. I'm really interested in the product, but I can only go up to $80 right now.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is far too low. While I'm interested in selling, I'm not willing to part with the product for such a low price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $80 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $125. It's still a fair price for the quality of this product. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 125}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I really appreciate you coming down in price, but $125 is still a bit too much for me.  I'm willing to go up to $100.  Let's see if we can meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $100 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not satisfied with the offer.  I'll counteroffer again in the next round, hoping to find a price that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $112.50?  That's a fair compromise, and it's still a good deal for you considering the quality of this product.  Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 112.5}
