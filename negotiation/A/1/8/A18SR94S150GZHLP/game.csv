"Hello Bob, it's a pleasure to offer you this fantastic product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations.  Given its worth, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,400,000.",1400000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value of the product, $1,400,000 is still a bit high for my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,200,000 is significantly below what I consider a fair price. This product offers immense value, and I'm confident you'll see a substantial return on your investment. How about we meet halfway at $1,300,000?",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective on the product's value, but $1,300,000 is still too high for me. Let's split the difference â€“ I'm offering $1,250,000.  I think this is a fair price that reflects both our needs.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're clearly recognizing the value of this product. Let's find a solution that works for both of us. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,280,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it reflects the true worth of what's being offered.",1280000.0,Alice,5,
