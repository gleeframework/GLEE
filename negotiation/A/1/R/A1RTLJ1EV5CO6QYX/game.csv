"Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe I can't justify spending $1,200,000 on this product. Could we perhaps negotiate a price closer to my valuation of $950,000? I understand if this isn't feasible, but I wanted to give it a try. Looking forward to your response!",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $950,000 is a bit too low for me.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to accept $1,050,000.  This would still give you a good deal, and it's closer to my value for the product. Let me know what you think!",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. While $1,050,000 is an improvement, I still feel that we could reach a mutually beneficial agreement. Would it be possible for you to consider $1,025,000? I believe this price reflects both the value of the product and my budget constraints. I hope this proposal is acceptable to you.",1025000.0,Bob,4,
