"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product.  It's a real gem, and I know it'll be a great asset to you. I'm asking for $900,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price that's above Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation. It also establishes a friendly tone to encourage a collaborative approach."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget. Can we discuss further? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is below my minimum value of $800,000, I'm not ready to sell to John yet. I believe there's still room for negotiation with Bob, especially since he's shown willingness to compromise. I'll counter with a price closer to my desired value to see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $750,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000,  which is still a fair price considering the value of this product.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand that you're willing to come down to $850,000, but I'm still a bit far apart from that. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'm offering $775,000. Can we meet in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $775,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum value of $800,000, I'm still not ready to sell to him. I believe there's still potential to get a better price.  I'll counter with a slightly higher offer to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price before resorting to selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate.  While $775,000 is getting closer, I'm still at a point where I need to get at least $825,000 for this product.  Let's split the difference between our last two offers and see if we can make this work. "", ""product_price"": 825000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand that you're trying to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit concerned about the price. I'm willing to go up to $795,000, but that's as high as I can go. Can we meet at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $795,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $795,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $795,000 is very close to my minimum value of $800,000. However, with only 4 rounds remaining, the risk of not reaching an agreement with Bob is too high.  It's better to secure the guaranteed $800,000 from John and avoid the potential for a lower price or a failed negotiation."
