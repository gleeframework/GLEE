Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $140. I believe it provides significant value at this price, especially considering it's worth $150 to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Aim high to maximize potential profit. Starting at $140 allows room for negotiation while staying below Bob's perceived value.
* **Strategic Positioning:** The message highlights the product's value to Bob, making it more appealing. 
* **Alternative Option:** While there's a backup buyer, getting a higher price from Bob is ideal.

This approach balances ambition with the knowledge that a lower, guaranteed offer exists if Bob declines."
