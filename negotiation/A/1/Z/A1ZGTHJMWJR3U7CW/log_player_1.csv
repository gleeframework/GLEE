Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 175}
```

I'm starting with a price higher than what I know the product is worth to Bob. This is a strategic move to see if he's willing to pay a premium, and to start the negotiation process. If he rejects, I'll be prepared to counter with a lower price, but still higher than my minimum acceptable price of $150."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $120 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 140}
```

I'm offering a counteroffer of $140. This is still above Bob's offer, but it's a compromise that shows I'm willing to negotiate. Hopefully, this will be a good middle ground and we can reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $130 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still going to reject Bob's offer.  I'm not desperate to sell, and I'm confident that I can get a better price. I'll counter with a slightly lower price, but still higher than Bob's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 135}
```

I'm offering a counteroffer of $135. This is a compromise that shows I'm willing to negotiate while still trying to get as close as possible to my desired price. I hope Bob will accept this offer, but I'm prepared to continue negotiating if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low for me. I'm willing to walk away and sell the product to John for a higher price. It's not ideal to have to settle for less, but it's better than accepting a deal that doesn't meet my minimum requirements."
