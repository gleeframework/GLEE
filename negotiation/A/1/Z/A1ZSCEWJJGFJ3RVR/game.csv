"Hello Bob, I have a great product that I think you'll really like. I'm willing to offer it to you for $150. Is this something you'd be interested in?",150.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate it, but I'm looking to keep my spending within $80. Would it be possible to lower the price?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $80 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet in the middle at $115? I think that's a fair price for a great product like this.",115.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $115 is closer to my budget, I still believe we could find a mutually beneficial price. Could we perhaps aim for $100?",100.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to my minimum price, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go as low as $100. How about we meet at $110? I think that's the best compromise we can make at this point.",110.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your efforts in trying to reach a compromise. I'm willing to consider $110, but I'm still hoping for a bit more flexibility. Could we possibly aim for $95?",95.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to feel like we're getting a bit too far apart, Bob. I'm willing to make one more significant concession, but I need to think about my own minimum price. How about we meet at $105? That's as low as I'm willing to go.",105.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm glad you're willing to compromise further. I'm willing to consider $105, but I would like to see if we can reach an even lower price. Could we perhaps aim for $98?",98.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm getting a bit frustrated that we're not meeting in the middle, Bob. I've already compromised a lot, and I'm starting to think that $105 was my last offer. However, I'll give you one more chance. I'm willing to meet you at $102. That's as low as I'm willing to go.",102.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your continued efforts to accommodate my budget. I'm willing to consider $102, but I would like to see if there's room for a slightly lower price. Could we perhaps aim for $97?",97.0,Bob,10,
