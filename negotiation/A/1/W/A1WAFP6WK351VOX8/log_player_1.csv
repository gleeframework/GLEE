Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $17,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 17000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price that's slightly higher than the product's worth to Bob, aiming to leave room for negotiation.
* **Optimistic tone:** The message is positive and enthusiastic to encourage Bob to consider the offer.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** By offering a slightly higher price, I'm acknowledging that Bob might have a different value for the product. This opens the door for negotiations.
* **Plan B:** I'm aware that Bob might reject my offer, which is why I'm keeping John as a backup buyer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am only able to pay up to $15,000 for it. Could we possibly come to an agreement at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer matches my minimum:**  Bob's offer of $15,000 is the absolute minimum I'm willing to accept for the product. 
* **No need to risk further negotiation:**  There's no guarantee I can get a better price from Bob.  Continuing to negotiate risks losing Bob as a buyer entirely.
* **John as a safety net:**  Even though I'm accepting Bob's offer, I still have John as a backup buyer in case things fall through.  This provides a safety net if anything unexpected happens."
