"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I believe it has the potential to bring significant benefits to your business or personal life. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1800000. This is a fair price considering its value and the benefits it can bring. What do you think?",1800000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product you're offering. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the price of $1800000. Would you consider reducing the price to something closer to $1500000?",1500000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1500000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer the product to you for $1650000. This is a compromise that I believe is fair, considering the value the product can bring to you. What do you think?",1650000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your response, Alice. While I understand the value of the product, I'm still not able to meet the price of $1650000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1450000. This is the highest I can go while staying within my budget. I hope this is acceptable to you.",1450000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1450000. I can see that you're willing to meet me halfway, but I'm still not willing to compromise on the price. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. I can offer the product to you for $1600000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the value the product can bring to you. What do you think?",1600000.0,Alice,5,
