"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm really interested in the product, but $11,500 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider a lower price, perhaps around $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $11,500 is a bit high for you, but I'm still willing to negotiate. I can offer you a compromise: I'll sell the product to you for $11,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the value of the product.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you working with me on the price, Alice.  While $11,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,500?",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $10,500 is still a bit above your comfort level, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer you a final deal: I'll sell the product to you for $10,800. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great value for the product.",10800.0,Alice,5,
