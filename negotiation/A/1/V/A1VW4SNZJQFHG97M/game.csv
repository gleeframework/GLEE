"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to make sure it's within my budget.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 just doesn't work for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, though. How about $13,500?  It's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my target price.  Let's make this happen!",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $13,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $12,500?",12500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I understand you're working within a budget, and I'm trying to be reasonable here.  How about we split the difference and go with $13,000? This is a fair price for both of us.  Let's close this deal!",13000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $13,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $12,750?",12750.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm starting to run out of time here.  Let's cut to the chase.  How about $12,900? It's just a small step up from your last offer, and it gets us closer to a deal. Let's close this now!",12900.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your urgency, but I'm not willing to go above $12,500. I'm willing to walk away if we can't meet at this price. Let's see if we can make a deal.",12500.0,Bob,8,
