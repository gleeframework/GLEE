"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $80
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $80 is a good price, it's still possible to get a better deal.  Rejecting the offer allows me to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 60}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a fairly aggressive counteroffer, dropping the price by 25%. This shows Alice I'm serious about getting a good deal, and it gives us room to negotiate. I'm hoping she'll meet me somewhere in the middle."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $70
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $70, which is a good compromise.  While I could try to push for a lower price, there's a risk that she'll get frustrated and either walk away or make a counteroffer I'm not willing to accept.  Accepting her offer ensures I get the product at a decent price within my budget and saves me time and potential frustration."
