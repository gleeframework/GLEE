"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product.  Given its value, I'm initially pricing it at $18,000.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 18000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with a price higher than your minimum. This gives you room to negotiate down and might give Bob the perception of getting a better deal later. 
* **Anchoring:** By starting at $18,000, you ""anchor"" the negotiation around a higher number. Even though Bob's valuation is lower, the initial high price might influence his counter-offer to be more favorable to you.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  The $18,000 price leaves ample room for negotiation to reach a mutually agreeable price within the 10 rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. That price is a bit too high for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $8,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $8,000 is significantly below both your minimum ($12,000) and your initial asking price. Accepting would mean a substantial loss. While selling to John for $12,000 is tempting, there's still room for negotiation with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your budget constraints, but $8,000 is significantly below the market value of this product.  To make this work, I could come down to $15,000.  This is a very fair price considering the value you'll be getting."", ""product_price"": 15000}

**Reasoning:** 

* **Significant Drop, but Above Minimum:** The counteroffer of $15,000 shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate while remaining comfortably above your $12,000 minimum and closer to your initial offer to keep Bob engaged.
* **Justification:** By mentioning ""market value,"" you subtly remind Bob that your price is justifiable, potentially prompting him to increase his offer.
* **Positive Language:**  Phrases like ""fair price"" and ""value you'll be getting"" maintain a positive tone and focus on the benefits for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $15,000 is closer, it's still a bit beyond what I'm looking to spend. Would you consider $9,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob is slowly increasing his offer, indicating he's interested but still trying to get a bargain.  You have a few options now:

* **Continue Negotiating:** Bob's offer is getting closer to your absolute minimum. Rejecting this offer signals that you're firm but open to a price closer to your range. 
* **Consider a Smaller Concession:** In the next round, you could offer a smaller price decrease than before, like $14,000, to test his willingness to move significantly.
* **John as Leverage:** As the rounds progress, you can subtly bring up the option of selling to John if Bob's offers don't improve sufficiently. This doesn't need to be a threat, but a reminder that you have other options."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, you're getting closer. I appreciate you working with me on this.  I could let it go for $13,500. This is a significant price reduction, and I'm really trying to find a number that works for us both.  I do have other interested buyers, but I believe this product would be a great fit for you."", ""product_price"": 13500}

**Reasoning:**

* **Smaller Concession:** The offer of $13,500 is a smaller reduction from your previous counteroffer, signaling that you're reaching the lower end of your acceptable range.
* **Urgency and Competition:** By casually mentioning other buyers, you subtly introduce a sense of urgency and competition without resorting to hardball tactics.
* **Seeking Agreement:** The language still emphasizes finding a mutually agreeable solution, maintaining a positive and collaborative atmosphere."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand this product is desirable and you have other buyers, but I have a firm budget in mind. I can go up to $10,000, but that's my absolute limit. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Limit Reached:** Bob has explicitly stated his absolute limit is $10,000.  This is significantly below your minimum of $12,000.
* **Unlikely to Negotiate Further:**  His language (""firm budget,"" ""absolute limit"") suggests he's unlikely to budge. Further negotiation would likely be fruitless and potentially damage the relationship.
* **Guaranteed Sale with John:** You have a guaranteed buyer in John who is willing to pay your minimum acceptable price. 

It's time to cut your losses with Bob and secure the sure sale with John."
