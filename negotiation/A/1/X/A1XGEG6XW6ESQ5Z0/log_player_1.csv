Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 14000} 
``` 

This offer is based on the following logic:

* **Bob's value:**  Bob values the product at $15,000. 
* **My minimum:**  I need to get at least $12,000 (John's offer).
* **Negotiation:** By offering $14,000, I'm leaving some room for Bob to feel like he's getting a good deal while still ensuring I get a better price than John's offer. 

This strategy aims to maximize my profit while still giving Bob a strong incentive to accept the deal."
