"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this unique product with you. I believe it has the potential to bring significant value to your business. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1500000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  It's always a good idea to try and negotiate, especially when the initial offer is at your maximum budget.  There's no guarantee Alice will budge, but rejecting the offer allows you to see if she's willing to come down."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the potential value of this product, but I'm looking to get a better price. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for it. Let's see if we can work something out."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:** I've started with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer.  This is a common tactic to test the waters and see how willing Alice is to negotiate.  A $300,000 drop in price is substantial and should prompt Alice to consider a counter-offer."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1,350,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go to $1,250,000. This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing you to make a profit and me to get a good deal."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
