"I appreciate your willingness to make one more compromise, Bob, but I'm afraid $1100000 is still a bit low for me. I've already compromised significantly, and I'm not willing to go any lower. I'm willing to make a final offer of $1200000, which is my minimum price. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,7,
