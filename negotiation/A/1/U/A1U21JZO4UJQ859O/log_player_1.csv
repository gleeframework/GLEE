Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $95.  It's a great deal and I think you'll be happy with it."", ""product_price"": 95}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting at $95, which is above Bob's perceived value of $80 but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  I'm not starting at the full $100 because it's unlikely Bob will accept that right away.  This allows for some back and forth.
* **Positive framing:**  The message is positive and friendly to encourage a positive response. 
* **Prepared for John:** I'm aware that I can sell to John for $100 if Bob doesn't accept, so I'm not overly pressured to close the deal with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm really looking to spend no more than $80. Would you be willing to consider $85?  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:**  I'm not willing to sell for less than $100. While $85 is closer to my minimum than Bob's initial offer, it's still below the line.
* **Opportunity for a counteroffer:**  I have a chance to counteroffer and potentially get closer to my desired price.  
* **John's offer is a safety net:**  Knowing John is ready to pay $100 gives me leverage and allows me to be more firm in my negotiations with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, and I appreciate your offer. However, I can't go that low. I'm willing to come down to $90. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:**  I'm offering a price halfway between my previous offer ($95) and Bob's offer ($85), demonstrating a willingness to compromise.
* **Staying above my minimum:**  $90 is still above my minimum of $100, ensuring I'm not selling below my perceived value.
* **Positive and encouraging tone:**  The message maintains a friendly tone to keep the negotiation positive.
* **Maintaining leverage:**  I'm still open to considering Bob's offer, but I'm making it clear that $90 is my bottom line."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $90 is still a bit higher than my budget.  Would you be willing to meet me at $87?  That's a fair compromise, and I'm sure we can both be happy with that price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $87. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:** I'm unwilling to sell below my minimum of $100, and $87 is below that.
* **John's offer is a guaranteed profit:**  I have a guaranteed sale for $100 with John. 
* **Negotiating further is risky:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob might result in him walking away, leaving me with no sale.

It's better to secure a sale with John now for a guaranteed profit than to risk losing both deals by trying to push Bob further."
