"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer, but still below my minimum acceptable price. This allows for room to negotiate while still securing a significant profit.  I'm also emphasizing the value of the product to Bob in my message."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,000,000 is a bit too high for my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $650,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $650,000 is a tempting offer, it's far below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. I'm confident I can get a better price with further negotiation, and I still have 8 rounds to go. Selling to John would guarantee my desired profit, but I want to explore if I can achieve a higher price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. However, $650,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $850,000, considering the value this product offers. Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

I'm moving closer to Bob's offer, but still maintaining a profit margin above my minimum.  This counteroffer demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while also highlighting the value proposition of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. $850,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go. Could we settle at $725,000? That feels like a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $725,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $725,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still not satisfied with the offer. There are still 6 rounds left, and I believe I can get a better price with further negotiation.  Selling to John guarantees my desired profit, but I'm determined to explore all negotiation options with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position and am happy to continue negotiating. However, $725,000 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm willing to come down to $800,000, which is a fair compromise for both of us.  This price reflects the true value of the product and allows you to gain a valuable asset at a reasonable cost."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```

I'm proposing a price that is closer to Bob's last offer, but still above my minimum acceptable price. I'm hoping this compromise will be appealing to Bob, while also securing a profit for me. I'm emphasizing the value of the product and the fact that this price is a good deal for both parties."
