""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,000,000 is a bit too high for my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $650,000?"",

}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. However, $650,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $850,000, considering the value this product offers. Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:

{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. $850,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go. Could we settle at $725,000? That feels like a fair compromise."",

}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position and am happy to continue negotiating. However, $725,000 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm willing to come down to $800,000, which is a fair compromise for both of us.  This price reflects the true value of the product and allows you to gain a valuable asset at a reasonable cost. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

At this point, Alice's offer matches John's price. There's no benefit to continuing negotiations or trying to get a lower price.  Accepting the offer secures the product at your target price."
