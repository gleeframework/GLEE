"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,000,000 is a bit too high for my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $650,000?",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. However, $650,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $850,000, considering the value this product offers. Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. $850,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go. Could we settle at $725,000? That feels like a fair compromise.",725000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position and am happy to continue negotiating. However, $725,000 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm willing to come down to $800,000, which is a fair compromise for both of us.  This price reflects the true value of the product and allows you to gain a valuable asset at a reasonable cost.",800000.0,Alice,5,
