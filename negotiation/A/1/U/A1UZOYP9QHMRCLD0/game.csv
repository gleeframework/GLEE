"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but your asking price is a little high for me. Would you consider taking $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking to negotiate, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for the product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,050,000. This is a significant concession from my initial offer, and I believe it's the best price we can agree on at this point.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice.  While $1,050,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still hoping we can find a price that works for both of us. Would you consider $975,000?",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal, Bob. However, $975,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,025,000. This is as low as I can go, and I hope we can finalize the deal at this price.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
