,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $700,000 is too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $900,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer and a fair price considering the product's value. Let me know if you're interested.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $900,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm thinking more along the lines of $750,000. Can you meet me at that price?",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $750,000 is still significantly below what I need to make this worthwhile. How about we split the difference at $850,000? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find the product valuable.",850000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm not sure $850,000 is the best deal for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $750,000 and $900,000, which would be $825,000. Can you consider that?",825000.0,Bob,6,
