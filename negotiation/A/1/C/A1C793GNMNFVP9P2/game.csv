"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our initial offer and your counteroffer. I'll sell the product to you for $9,500. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",9500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I really appreciate your flexibility.  $9,500 is getting closer, but I'm still a bit stretched.  How about we split the difference again and go with $9,000?  That would be a great deal for both of us.",9000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $9,000 is still a bit below my target, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll sell the product to you for $9,250. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's a fair compromise considering the product's value to you.",9250.0,Alice,5,
