{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and willingness to negotiate. While $9,000 is closer, it's still a bit low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $10,500?  This would still be a great deal for you, considering the product's value to you."", ""product_price"": 10500}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, you're really tough! I'm trying my best to reach a fair price here.  How about $9,900? That's a significant jump from my last offer.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,900

``` 
The offer of $9,900 is close enough to the midpoint of my last offer ($10,125) that it's worth accepting to avoid further haggling and potential risk of a lower offer from Bob or even losing the deal altogether."
