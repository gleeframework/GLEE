"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and willingness to negotiate. While $9,000 is closer, it's still a bit low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $10,500?  This would still be a great deal for you, considering the product's value to you.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $10,500 is still a little high for my budget. Would you be willing to come down to $9,750?",9750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget.  I'm willing to go a bit lower to make this work, but $9,750 just doesn't cut it for me. Let's split the difference at $10,125.  That's a fair price for both of us.",10125.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, you're really tough! I'm trying my best to reach a fair price here.  How about $9,900? That's a significant jump from my last offer.",9900.0,Bob,6,
