Alice's offer:

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to find a middle ground, but I'm not willing to go all the way down to $120. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $140 and $120, which would be $130. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While I could try to push Alice further, getting the price down to $130 is a decent deal and there's no guarantee she'll go lower. It's better to secure a good price now rather than risk the negotiation going nowhere."
