"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $180 is too high for me. I'm interested in the product but I can only go as high as $100.",100.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $180 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer it to you for $140. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product!",140.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you coming down on the price Alice, but $140 is still a bit much for me. Would you be willing to meet in the middle somewhere around $120?",120.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to find a middle ground, but I'm not willing to go all the way down to $120. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $140 and $120, which would be $130. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product!",130.0,Alice,5,
