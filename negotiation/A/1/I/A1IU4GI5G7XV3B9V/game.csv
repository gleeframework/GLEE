"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to spend less than $1,300,000. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value we both see in it. What do you think?",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,000,000 is significantly below its true value.  Let's meet in the middle â€“ how about $1,175,000? This feels like a fair compromise.",1175000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,175,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference - I'm willing to pay $1,100,000.  This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us. ",1100000.0,Bob,4,
