"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product but $10,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $10,000 is a bit high for you, but I'm still looking to get a good price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $9,000. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $9,000 is still more than I'm comfortable with. How about $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $9,000 is still a bit high for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $7,000. I'm willing to make another concession and offer it to you for $8,500. This is my final offer, so I hope you can meet me in the middle.",8500.0,Alice,5,
