"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,100,000. It's a great deal for both of us - you get a valuable product at a price lower than you're willing to pay, and I still get a significant return on my investment. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You're willing to pay up to $1,000,000 for the product. Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is above your maximum.  It's better to reject her offer and buy from John for $1,000,000."
