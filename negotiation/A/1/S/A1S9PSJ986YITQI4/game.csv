"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $18,000 is outside my budget.  I'm very interested in this product, but I can only afford to pay $12,000.  Would you be willing to consider that price?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I value your offer, $12,000 is significantly below my asking price.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $15,000?",15000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $15,000 is still too high for me.  Would you be willing to come down to $13,500?  That's a significant compromise on my end, and I'm confident we can finalize the deal.",13500.0,Bob,4,
