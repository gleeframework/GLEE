"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident it will be worth the investment for you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:** I'm starting with a price slightly below my minimum acceptable value ($15,000). This leaves room for negotiation while still maximizing my potential profit.
* **Positive Framing:**  The message is positive and emphasizes the value the product will bring to Bob. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The initial offer leaves room for Bob to counter without me feeling like I'm giving too much away. 

This strategy is designed to start the negotiation in a favorable position while also remaining open to finding a mutually agreeable solution."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure it's a good deal for me. Can you consider my counteroffer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  $11,500 is significantly below my minimum acceptable value of $15,000, and even lower than my initial offer of $14,000. Accepting this would be a substantial loss.
* **Potential for Better Outcome:**  While Bob is clearly trying to negotiate, his offer is too low to consider. There's a good chance I can get a better price by counter-offering or even selling to John. 
* **Staying Firm:** Rejecting Bob's offer demonstrates my willingness to stand firm on my value proposition. 

By rejecting the offer, I maintain leverage and open the door to potentially securing a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $11,500 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to my initial offer. How about $13,000? This would still give you a good price while allowing me to get closer to my minimum value.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Finding Middle Ground:**  My counteroffer is a compromise, moving closer to Bob's offer but still significantly above his initial proposal.
* **Emphasizing Value:** I reiterate the value of the product and the potential benefit to Bob.
* **Creating Urgency:** By offering a compromise and emphasizing a ""win-win"" solution, I aim to encourage Bob to consider my offer seriously. 

This counteroffer is designed to move the negotiation closer to a mutually agreeable price while still protecting my interests."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but $13,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again. How about $12,750? This is the best I can do, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:**  $12,750 is still below my minimum acceptable value of $15,000. While it's closer than previous offers, it's not yet a good deal for me.
* **Potential for Higher Offer:**  Bob is showing a willingness to negotiate. This suggests there's potential for a higher offer if I push back a bit further.
* **John as a Safety Net:**  Knowing I have John as a backup option at $15,000 gives me the confidence to hold out for a better price from Bob. 

Rejecting this offer allows me to continue the negotiation and potentially secure a price closer to my desired range."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $12,750 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13,500. This is a fair price considering the value this product brings. Let's try to close the deal,  I believe this is a win-win scenario for both of us."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Gradual Compromise:** I'm lowering my offer again, showing flexibility while still staying above my minimum.
* **Focus on Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's worth to emphasize why my offer is fair.
* **Positive Framing:** I'm framing the offer as a ""win-win"" to encourage acceptance.

This strategy aims to:

*  Maintain my position while showing willingness to negotiate.
*  Indicate that I'm nearing my limit, increasing pressure on Bob. 
*  Hopefully entice Bob to accept the offer to avoid further negotiations."

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but $13,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again. How about $13,250? This is the best I can do, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,250

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** $13,250 is still below my minimum acceptable value of $15,000. Although it's closer to my goal, it's not yet a good deal for me.
* **Continuing Negotiation:**  Bob is showing a willingness to negotiate, and I believe there's still room for improvement. There is a good chance I can get a better price by continuing the negotiation process.
* **John as a Safety Net:**  Having John as an alternative buyer gives me the confidence to hold out for a price closer to my desired range.  I'm not desperate to sell to Bob.

By rejecting this offer, I maintain my position and potentially secure a price closer to my minimum acceptable value."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping to reach a price closer to my initial target.  How about $13,750? It's a small step from your last offer, but it would allow us to find common ground. Let's bridge the gap and close this deal."", ""product_price"": 13750}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Compromise:** This counteroffer represents a small but meaningful concession from my previous offer.  It shows Bob that I'm still open to negotiation, but I'm not willing to go much lower.
* **Bridge the Gap:** The message explicitly focuses on finding common ground and bridging the gap between our desired prices. This encourages a sense of progress and compromise.
* **Urgency:**  The ""let's close this deal"" phrase adds a slight sense of urgency, subtly pushing Bob to make a decision.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your persistence, but $13,750 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again. How about $13,375? This is the best I can do, and I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,375. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,375

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:**  $13,375 is still below my minimum acceptable value of $15,000.  While it's the closest offer yet, it's still not a good deal for me.
* **Two Rounds Left:** With only two rounds remaining, I need to be strategic.  If I reject this offer, I can make one final counteroffer and still have the option of selling to John.
* **John is the Safe Option:** John is willing to pay my minimum price. If I can't reach an agreement with Bob, I have a guaranteed alternative.

By rejecting this offer, I keep the door open for a better deal while also maintaining my leverage and the ability to sell to John as a last resort."

Round 9
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to continue working with you, but $13,375 is just a little too low for me. Let's try to split the difference. I'll come down to $13,500, which is the middle ground between our last offers. This would give us both a good deal.  Let's finalize this agreement and move forward."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

* **Final Compromise:** This offer is a small concession from my previous counteroffer, showing flexibility while still being above my minimum. 
* **Focus on Middle Ground:** Emphasizing the middle ground between our offers creates a sense of fairness and encourages compromise. 
* **Closing the Deal:** I reiterate the benefits of finalizing the deal, hoping to encourage Bob to accept and avoid further negotiations.

*  Maintain a good price while demonstrating a willingness to reach a compromise.

*  Hopefully encourage Bob to accept and close the deal before the final round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your persistence, but I'm not willing to go any higher than $12,500. This is my final offer. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm willing to close the deal. If not, I'll have to consider buying from John.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Below Minimum:** Bob's final offer of $12,500 is significantly below my minimum acceptable value of $15,000. 
* **No Further Negotiation:**  This is the final round, and I've reached my limit in terms of concessions. There's no chance of getting a better deal from Bob.
* **John is the Better Option:**  John is willing to pay my minimum price, guaranteeing a better outcome than accepting Bob's offer. 

I've shown flexibility throughout the negotiation but have reached a point where it's more beneficial to walk away and secure a guaranteed sale to John."
