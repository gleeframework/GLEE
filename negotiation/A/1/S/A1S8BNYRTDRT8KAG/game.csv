"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident it will be worth the investment for you. Let me know what you think!",14000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure it's a good deal for me. Can you consider my counteroffer?",11500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $11,500 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to my initial offer. How about $13,000? This would still give you a good price while allowing me to get closer to my minimum value.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, but $13,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again. How about $12,750? This is the best I can do, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",12750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $12,750 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13,500. This is a fair price considering the value this product brings. Let's try to close the deal,  I believe this is a win-win scenario for both of us.",13500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, but $13,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again. How about $13,250? This is the best I can do, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",13250.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping to reach a price closer to my initial target.  How about $13,750? It's a small step from your last offer, but it would allow us to find common ground. Let's bridge the gap and close this deal.",13750.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I understand your persistence, but $13,750 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again. How about $13,375? This is the best I can do, and I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",13375.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to continue working with you, but $13,375 is just a little too low for me. Let's try to split the difference. I'll come down to $13,500, which is the middle ground between our last offers. This would give us both a good deal.  Let's finalize this agreement and move forward.",13500.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I understand your persistence, but I'm not willing to go any higher than $12,500. This is my final offer. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm willing to close the deal. If not, I'll have to consider buying from John.",12500.0,Bob,10,
