Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, $18,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $15,500 for the product. Let's see if we can find some common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm not going to accept Bob's offer just yet. While I'm willing to negotiate, $15,500 is still below my desired price. I'll try to get a better offer from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still aiming for a higher price.  How about we split the difference and settle on $16,750?  I think that's a fair price, considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 16750}

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While I was hoping for a bit more, $16,000 is a good price and I don't want to risk losing the deal by continuing to negotiate."
