"Thank you for the offer, Alice. However, I believe the product is worth less than $1,200,000. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it. I think this is a fair price considering its value to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, $900,000 significantly undervalues the product's true potential. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.  This is my final offer.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
