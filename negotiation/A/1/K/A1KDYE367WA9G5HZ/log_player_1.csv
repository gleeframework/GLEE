"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 200}
```

I'm starting with a price of $200. This is a decent starting point that leaves room for negotiation but also ensures I'm getting something more than my minimum value.  I'm hoping Bob will be interested, but I'm prepared to counteroffer or sell to John if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $175. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $175
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $175 is better than selling to John, I'm hoping I can get closer to my initial asking price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 190}
```

I'm counteroffering at $190.  This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still above Bob's current offer.  I'm hoping this shows I'm willing to negotiate while still trying to maximize my profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $180
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  While I'd like to get closer to my initial asking price, I'm now getting closer to my minimum acceptable value and don't want to risk losing the sale to John. It's a good compromise."
