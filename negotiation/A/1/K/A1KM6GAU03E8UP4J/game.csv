"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $10,000. Let me know if that works for you.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer of $10,000. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm not willing to sell it for that low of a price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $14,000. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  $14,000 is still a bit much for my budget. How about we settle at $11,500? That's a fair price for both of us, I believe.",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $14,000 is still a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $11,500. I'm willing to compromise and offer it to you for $13,500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great deal for the product's value.",13500.0,Alice,5,
