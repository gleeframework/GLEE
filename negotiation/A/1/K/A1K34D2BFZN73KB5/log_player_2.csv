"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,100,000 is fair. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is too high.  You can potentially get a better deal by negotiating with Alice.  You have 10 rounds, so there's time to work towards a lower price. Buying from John immediately would be a worse outcome than negotiating with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I see the value of the product, $1,100,000 is a bit too high for me at this time. I'm happy to start with an offer of $950,000. This reflects a fair price that benefits both of us. Let's work together to find a mutually agreeable solution."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer Rationale:** This counteroffer is a significant step down from Alice's initial price, but it's still above her minimum value.  This shows you are serious about negotiating but are willing to be firm.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While your offer is tempting, the true value of this product is significantly higher. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is a competitive offer considering the substantial return on investment you'll see. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $1,050,000 is still a stretch for me.  I'm willing to go to $975,000, which reflects a compromise that considers the product's value and my budget.  This is a fair price that keeps the deal moving forward."", ""product_price"": 975000}
```
