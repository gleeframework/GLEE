The goal is to maximize profit.  While $9,000 is more than what John is offering, it's still less than what Alice's ideal price point is. There are still 4 rounds left to try and get closer to $10,500."

With only two rounds left, it's unlikely that Bob will increase his offer significantly. It's better to secure the sale with John at $8,000, which is still above your minimum threshold, rather than risk getting a lower offer from Bob or potentially ending up with no sale at all."
