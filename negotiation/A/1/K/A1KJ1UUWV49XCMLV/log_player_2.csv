Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to make it work, but I'm not willing to go as low as $98. I can offer you a slight compromise at $102. That's the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for you.

At this point, Alice is very unlikely to go below $100. It's better to cut your losses and buy from John for the guaranteed $100 price."
