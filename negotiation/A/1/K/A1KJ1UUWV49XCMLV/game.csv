,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a better deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $80. I can offer you a compromise at $110, which is still a great value for the product. What do you think?",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the compromise, Alice.  How about we meet in the middle at $95? That's a fair deal for both of us.",95.0,Bob,4,

"I like that you're willing to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit above that. I can offer you a slight discount to $105, but that's as low as I can go. What do you think?",105.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm trying to make this work, but $105 is pushing my budget. I could do $98, and I think that's a very fair offer.  What do you say?",98.0,Bob,6,

"I understand you're trying to make it work, but I'm not willing to go as low as $98. I can offer you a slight compromise at $102. That's the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for you.",102.0,Alice,7,
