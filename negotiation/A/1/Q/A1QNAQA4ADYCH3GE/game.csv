"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $14,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find some middle ground.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand your position, Bob. However, the value of this product is significant, and I can't go as low as $10,000.  Would you consider $12,500? It's a fair compromise.",12500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $12,500 is still a bit outside my budget.  How about we split the difference and go with $11,250? I think that's a fair price that reflects the value of the product for both of us.",11250.0,Bob,4,
