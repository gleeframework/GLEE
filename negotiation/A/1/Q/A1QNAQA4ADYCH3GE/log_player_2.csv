# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. I believe it would be incredibly valuable to you. Given its potential, I'm asking for $14,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

**Reasoning:**

While $14,000 is a good price, it's still higher than Alice's valuation of $8,000.  There's room for negotiation to try and get a better deal."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your position, Bob. However, the value of this product is significant, and I can't go as low as $10,000.  Would you consider $12,500? It's a fair compromise.

**Reasoning:**

Alice is coming down in price, which is a good sign.  However, $12,500 is still too high.  There's still room for negotiation to get closer to my target price."
