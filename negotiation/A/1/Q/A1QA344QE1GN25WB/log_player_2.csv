"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am excited to present our premium product to you. It holds immense value to us, but considering its significance to you, we are willing to consider offers starting from $900,000. We believe this reflects the product's worth while also allowing room for negotiation. Looking forward to your response. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  He can potentially save a lot more money by negotiating further.  $900,000 is a good starting point, but Bob can likely get a better deal."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. While we appreciate your interest in the product, we need to maintain a certain level of profitability. Therefore, we are unable to accept $750,000. Our counteroffer is $850,000. We hope this proposal is more in line with what you're looking for. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $850,000 is better than her initial offer of $900,000, there's still room for negotiation. He can try to push for a lower price and see if Alice will budge. It's worth trying to get a better deal before resorting to buying from John."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $850,000, but I'm still a bit higher than where I want to be.  I'm willing to pay $800,000 for the product.

Let's see if we can bridge the gap and reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 800000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. After careful consideration, we are pleased to counter with $825,000. We believe this price reflects the value of the product while allowing both parties to benefit. We look forward to your response. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  At $825,000, he's saving $375,000 compared to buying from John. While he could try to negotiate further, the risk of Alice rejecting his counteroffer and forcing him to buy from John at a higher price is too high.  It's a good deal for Bob, and it's likely that he won't be able to get a significantly lower price."
