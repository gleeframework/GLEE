"Dear Bob, I am excited to present our premium product to you. It holds immense value to us, but considering its significance to you, we are willing to consider offers starting from $900,000. We believe this reflects the product's worth while also allowing room for negotiation. Looking forward to your response.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. $900,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to get a better deal.  I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product.  I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product to me, while still allowing you a reasonable profit.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. While we appreciate your interest in the product, we need to maintain a certain level of profitability. Therefore, we are unable to accept $750,000. Our counteroffer is $850,000. We hope this proposal is more in line with what you're looking for.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $850,000, but I'm still a bit higher than where I want to be.  I'm willing to pay $800,000 for the product. This represents a significant savings for me, and I believe it's a fair price that still allows you to make a reasonable profit. Let's see if we can bridge the gap and reach an agreement.",800000.0,Bob,4,
