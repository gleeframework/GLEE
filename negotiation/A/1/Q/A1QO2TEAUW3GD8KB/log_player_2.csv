"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I am pleased to offer you this product at a price of $1,150,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering its value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $1,150,000 is a better price than John's offer, it's still higher than the product's value to Alice. This means there's room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get an even better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $1,050,000.  This reflects the value you've indicated and allows for a fair profit for both of us.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but the value of this product is truly significant.  Let's meet in the middle â€“ how about $1,110,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,110,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,110,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,110,000 is still above the product's value to her, but it's getting closer to Bob's desired price range.  It's also a significantly better deal than buying from John for $1,200,000. Accepting this offer means saving $90,000 compared to John's price, making it the most financially sensible choice."
