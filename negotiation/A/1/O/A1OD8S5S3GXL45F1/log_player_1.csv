Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

This offer is based on the following reasoning:

* **My minimum value:** I know the product is worth at least $1,200,000 to me, so I won't sell it for less.
* **Potential upside:** I'm hoping Bob values the product higher than me. A $300,000 increase is a significant gain, but still leaves room for Bob to feel he's getting a good deal. 
* **John as a safety net:** I'm not overly concerned about Bob rejecting the offer, as I have a guaranteed sale to John at my minimum value. This allows me to be more aggressive with my pricing.

By offering a price higher than my minimum, I'm aiming to strike a balance between maximizing my profit and increasing the likelihood of Bob accepting the offer."
