"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $9,000 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer. How about $10,500?  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows both of us to come to an agreement.",10500.0,Alice,3,
