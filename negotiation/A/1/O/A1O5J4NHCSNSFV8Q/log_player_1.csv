{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I know you've been interested in. I'm offering it to you for $12,000. It's a great deal considering its value, and I'm sure it will be a valuable asset for you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer starts high, but still leaves room for negotiation. By offering it at $12,000, I'm hoping to get a price closer to my minimum of $15,000. It also opens the door for Bob to counteroffer, allowing for a potential win-win situation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $9,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $9,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly below my minimum value of $15,000.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $9,000 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer. How about $10,500?  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows both of us to come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 10500}
