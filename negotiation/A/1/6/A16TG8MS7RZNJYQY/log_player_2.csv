"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob,
I am delighted to present you with an extraordinary opportunity to acquire a unique product that I believe is worth far more than its tangible value. This product holds immense significance and has the potential to significantly impact your endeavors or personal pursuits. Given its intrinsic worth, I am offering it to you at a special price that reflects its true value and the opportunity it presents.

I propose to sell the product to you for $1,250,000. This offer is designed to be mutually beneficial, providing you with an exceptional value while ensuring a substantial return on my investment. I understand that such a transaction requires careful consideration, and I am here to answer any questions or provide additional information to help you make an informed decision.

Please let me know if this proposal meets your expectations or if you would like to discuss further details. I am looking forward to the possibility of working together to bring this valuable asset into your possession.

Best regards,
Alice 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's asking price is too high:** While Alice's offer of $1,250,000 is less than your maximum budget of $1,500,000, it's significantly higher than what it's worth to her ($1,000,000). This suggests there's room for negotiation.
* **John's offer is a fallback:** You know you can get the product for $1,500,000 from John. This acts as a safety net, meaning you don't have to accept an unfavorable deal from Alice. 

By rejecting Alice's initial offer, you create the opportunity for her to come back with a lower price, potentially closer to her own valuation."
