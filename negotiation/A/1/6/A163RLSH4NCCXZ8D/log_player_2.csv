"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm happy to offer you the product for $180. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really appreciate the value it brings. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

Alice's offer is way above your budget. It makes more sense to go with John's offer of $120."
