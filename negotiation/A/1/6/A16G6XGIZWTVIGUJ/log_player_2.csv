"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is at your maximum price.** You are willing to pay $1,200,000, and she is offering it for that price.
* **There's no advantage to buying from Alice.** You get the same product for the same price from either Alice or John. 
* **Rejecting the offer opens the possibility of negotiation.** Even if you buy from John, rejecting Alice's offer shows her that you're willing to walk away. This could potentially lead to Alice lowering her price if she wants to make the sale."
