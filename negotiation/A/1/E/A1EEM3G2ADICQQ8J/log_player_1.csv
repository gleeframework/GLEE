Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit short. How about $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Explanation:  Bob is unlikely to go much higher, and it's not worth risking losing the guaranteed $100 from John."
