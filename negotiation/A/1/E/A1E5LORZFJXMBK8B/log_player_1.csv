{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $1,200,000. This is a good starting point because it's higher than the product's value to Bob, but not so high that he's likely to immediately reject it. I'll see how he responds and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low. While I'd like to make a deal, $900,000 is below my minimum threshold. I will counteroffer to try and reach a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $1,100,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low. I'm willing to walk away from this negotiation and accept John's offer of $1,000,000. This ensures I get my minimum desired value for the product and avoids further negotiation with Bob."
