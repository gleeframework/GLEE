"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob,
I am delighted to present our premium product, which I believe would significantly enhance the value and efficiency of your operations. Given its exceptional quality and unique features, I estimate its true worth to be $1,500,000. However, to facilitate a mutually beneficial transaction, I am extending an exclusive offer to you at a special price of $1,200,000. This represents a significant saving compared to the market value, making it an attractive proposition for you.

Please consider this offer carefully. Should you have any questions or require further information, please do not hesitate to reach out. I look forward to the possibility of working with you and contributing to the success of your business.

Best regards,
Alice

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is less than your maximum budget, you know you have a guaranteed option to buy the product from John for $1,500,000. This gives you room to negotiate. By rejecting Alice's initial offer, you signal that you're looking for a better deal and open the door for a potential counter-offer closer to your ideal price."
