"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $105 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $110. This is still a great deal for you, and I'm confident it's fair considering the value of the product. Let's meet in the middle.",110.0,Alice,3,

,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I understand your budget constraints, but $108 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's try $109. This is a small difference, and it would be a great deal for you. I'm really hoping we can find a solution that works for both of us.",109.0,Alice,5,
