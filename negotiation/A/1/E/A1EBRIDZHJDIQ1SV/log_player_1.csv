I've decided to sell the product to John for $120. While I'm confident I could continue negotiating with Bob, the risk of him rejecting my offer again, or of not reaching a favorable price within the remaining rounds, is too high. Selling to John ensures I get the best possible price for my product and allows me to avoid further negotiations."
