Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $925,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Considering the value to you, I'm willing to pay $850,000.  This would still be a good profit for you, and a great deal for me.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
