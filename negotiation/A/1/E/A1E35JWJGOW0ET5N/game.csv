"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $7,500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $8,250?  This would still give you a great deal on the product, and I would be happy with the price.",8250.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your counteroffer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $7,800? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",7800.0,Bob,4,
