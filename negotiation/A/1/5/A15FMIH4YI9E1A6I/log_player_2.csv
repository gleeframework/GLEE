"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. I know it's worth a lot to me, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $12,000 is still above his maximum budget of $8,000. He can try to negotiate a lower price with Alice before resorting to buying from John."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. While I appreciate your interest, $8,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,000 to make this work. It's a fair price considering the product's value.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $10,000 is better than Alice's initial offer, it's still above Bob's budget. He should try to negotiate a lower price with Alice before considering buying from John."

{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $10,000 is still out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product. It's a fair compromise, and it allows us both to get a decent deal.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,500 as a final offer. It's a fair compromise, and it allows us both to get a decent deal. If you're not willing to go higher, I'll have to move on to another buyer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

While $9,500 is closer to Bob's budget than previous offers, it's still above his maximum of $8,000. Since Alice is firm on her offer, Bob should buy the product from John for $8,000. This ensures he stays within his budget and avoids further negotiation."
