"I'm excited to offer you this incredible product for a steal! It's a rare opportunity to own a truly unique item, and I'm willing to let it go for a price that's significantly lower than its true value. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $18,000. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice! However, $18,000 is a bit out of my price range.  I'm really interested in the product, but I can only go up to $12,000.  What do you think?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $12,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can do $16,000, which is a great deal considering the product's value. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $16,000 is still a little high for me.  I'm firm on my offer of $12,000. If you can't come down to that, I'm going to have to go with another seller.",12000.0,Bob,4,
