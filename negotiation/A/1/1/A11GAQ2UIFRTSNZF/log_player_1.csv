Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 200}
```

I'm starting with a price of $200. This is a reasonable starting point, as it's higher than my minimum acceptable price of $150, but still leaves room for negotiation. I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $180
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $180 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I believe I can still get closer to my initial asking price. I'm going to see if I can push for a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 190}
```

I'm going to counter with $190. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer, and I hope it's a price that Bob is willing to accept. I want to maximize my profit but also be reasonable to keep the negotiation moving forward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $170. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $170
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While $170 isn't my ideal price, it's still higher than selling to John for $150. This is a good compromise and allows me to avoid further negotiation."
