Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below your estimated value and allows me a comfortable profit. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and make a deal, but I need to stay within my budget. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
While $9,500 is closer to my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price. It's worth exploring further negotiations to maximize my profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, I'm still hoping for a slightly higher price. I'm willing to come down to $9,750. This offers a fair compromise and allows us both to benefit from this deal. Let's work together to find a solution that works for both of us!"", ""product_price"": 9750}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $9,500. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget constraints. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd like to get closer to my initial goal, Bob's offer of $9,500 is a decent compromise and is only $500 below my previous offer. There's a good chance that further negotiation won't yield a better outcome, and I risk losing the deal altogether.  I'll accept Bob's offer and secure a sale."
