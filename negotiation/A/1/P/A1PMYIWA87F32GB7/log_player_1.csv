``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's lower than my minimum price of $1,500,000, but it leaves room for negotiation and is still significantly higher than the product's value to Bob. This will hopefully incentivize him to make a counteroffer, allowing us to reach a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering my budget and the product's value to me. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. While I want to close the deal, I'm not willing to sell for such a low amount. I'll make a counteroffer to see if we can bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This reflects the value of the product and gives you a good deal. Let's try to work something out."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,000,000 is still out of my price range.  I'm ready to pay $900,000 for the product, which is a fair price considering my budget and the value we both see in it. Let's close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $900,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below my desired range. I'm not ready to sell for that amount yet. I'll make one more counteroffer to see if we can reach a compromise."
