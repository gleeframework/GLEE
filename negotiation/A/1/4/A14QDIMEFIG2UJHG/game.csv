"Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $8,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price.  How about $8,750?  This is a very valuable product, and I'm confident you'll agree it's worth the investment.",8750.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit concerned about the price. How about $7,500? I really think it's a fair price for this product.",7500.0,Bob,4,
