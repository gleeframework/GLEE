"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $18,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident it'll be worth every penny to you. Let me know your thoughts!",18000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm not sure I can go as high as $18,000. I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. Can you meet me in the middle at $14,000?",14000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $14,000 just doesn't cover my costs. I'm willing to meet you halfway though. How about $16,000?  That would be a fair compromise, and I'm sure you'll still find it a worthwhile investment.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you need to make a profit, but $16,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $13,500. Can we meet in the middle again?",13500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $13,500 is simply not enough for me. Let's try to find a compromise that works for both of us. How about $15,500? It's a fair price considering the value of the product, and it gives me some room to cover my costs. What do you think?",15500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm still a bit hesitant about the price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway again. How about $14,750? That's the highest I'm willing to go.",14750.0,Bob,6,
