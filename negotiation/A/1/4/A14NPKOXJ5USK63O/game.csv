"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $1,200,000 is unfortunately above my budget.  I'm very interested in the product, and I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for it. This is a fair price that reflects its value to me, and I believe it's a good starting point for further discussion.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to sell the product at $1,050,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,175,000. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's value, and I believe it's a good compromise. I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts.",1175000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,175,000 is still outside my budget. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product. This price acknowledges the value you've placed on it while staying within my financial constraints. Let's make this deal happen!",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product at $1,100,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $1,150,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair price for the product's value. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",1150000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. However, $1,150,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,125,000 for the product. This is a fair compromise that acknowledges the value of the product while staying within my budget. Let's bridge the gap and finalize the deal.",1125000.0,Bob,6,
