"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:

It's not worth buying from Alice at $12,000 when you can get the product for $10,000 from John.  Rejecting Alice's offer allows you to try and negotiate a better price."

I'm starting with a low offer, hoping to get a better deal than John's price.  Alice might reject it, but it's a starting point for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500.

Alice's offer is still higher than what John is offering, so I will continue to try to negotiate a lower price."

I'm increasing my offer slightly, showing I'm willing to negotiate but still trying to get a better price than John's.  This is a good middle ground for the next round of negotiations."
