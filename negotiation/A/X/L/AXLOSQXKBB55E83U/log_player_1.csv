Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product. I'm open to offers, but I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us. What do you think about $115?"", ""product_price"": 115}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $105. Could you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'll reject Bob's offer. While $105 is better than nothing, I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price.  I'll counter with a slightly lower price to see if we can find common ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your counteroffer. I'm willing to come down a bit more. How about $110?  I think that's a fair price considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go as low as $105? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While $105 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still confident I can get a better price. I'll make another counteroffer to see if we can bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to keep negotiating, but $105 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference - how about $107.50?  I'm hoping we can reach an agreement soon."", ""product_price"": 107.5}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $120.  Bob has been stubborn and is not willing to go much higher. I've already compromised several times and it seems like we're at an impasse.  John is a guaranteed sale at a price I'm happy with, so it's time to move on."
