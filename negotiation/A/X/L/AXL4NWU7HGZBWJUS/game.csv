"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value of the product, $12,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it.  Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $8,500 is a bit lower than I'd hoped for, I'm willing to come down to $10,000. This is still a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can find common ground.",10000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $10,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $9,000. This is a fair price considering my budget and your desire to sell the product. What do you think?",9000.0,Bob,4,
