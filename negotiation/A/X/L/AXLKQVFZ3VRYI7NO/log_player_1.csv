"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if we can get closer to my desired price.  $900,000 is too low, and I believe we can reach a mutually agreeable price within the remaining rounds."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $900,000 is significantly below my desired price.  However, I'm willing to be flexible. How about $1,050,000?

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to be flexible, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. How about $1,025,000? That's the best I can do.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,025,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is closer to my desired price, I'm still not comfortable selling for $1,025,000. I'm going to counteroffer again, hoping to get closer to my desired price. I believe there's still room for negotiation, and I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement within the remaining rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,025,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1,000,000.

Round 6
Bob's offer:

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $975,000 is getting closer to my desired price, I'm not ready to sell yet. I'm going to counteroffer again. We are getting closer to a deal, and I believe we can reach a mutually beneficial price in the next few rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate.  However, $975,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $990,000.

Let's finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 990000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you at $955,000. That's the best I can do. Can you reconsider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $955,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

With only two rounds left, it's clear that Bob is unwilling to meet my price expectations.  I'm concerned that continuing to negotiate will only result in further concessions and a lower final price.  It's time to move on to John and secure a sale that's closer to my minimum price."
