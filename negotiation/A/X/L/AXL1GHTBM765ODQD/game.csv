"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1200000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1050000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective and appreciate your offer.  While $1050000 is a good starting point, it's still a bit below what I need to consider. I'm willing to come down to $1150000. This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us. Let's see if we can close this gap.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1150000 is still a bit higher than I'm willing to go.  How about we split the difference and meet at $1100000? This price is fair to both of us and allows us to move forward.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
