Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's value:** $14,000 is higher than the $8,000 Bob is willing to pay, so there's potential for negotiation.
* **It's below your floor:** $14,000 is less than your minimum acceptable price of $15,000, so you still stand to make a profit even if Bob rejects the offer.

This strategy allows for a potential win-win scenario. Bob might be willing to pay a little more than his initial value to get the product, and you'll still earn a good amount. If Bob rejects the offer, you can move on to John and get your minimum price."
