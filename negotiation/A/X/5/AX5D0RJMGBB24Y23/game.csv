"Hi Bob, I'm offering this great product for a limited time at the special price of $170. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides. What do you think?",170.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a little high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I could only do it for around $85. Would that work for you?",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $170 represents fair value, I understand your budget constraints. Could you do $140? I'm trying to find a middle ground here.",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me. $140 is still a bit too high for my budget. Could we possibly meet in the middle somewhere around $100?",100.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm seeing your point, but $100 is cutting it a bit too close to my bottom line. I could be persuaded to go down to $125, but that's my absolute best offer.  Let me know if that works for you.",125.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. I'm really trying to make this work, but $125 is still a bit of a stretch for me.  If you could do it for $110, I can close the deal right now. Otherwise, I might have to explore other options.",110.0,Bob,6,
