"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this great product for a limited time at the special price of $170. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $170. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $170
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a little high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I could only do it for around $85. Would that work for you?"", ""product_price"": 85} 
 
I'm starting with a low price to see how much bargaining power I have. However, I am still leaving room to negotiate upwards towards my $80 limit if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $170 represents fair value, I understand your budget constraints. Could you do $140? I'm trying to find a middle ground here. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me. $140 is still a bit too high for my budget. Could we possibly meet in the middle somewhere around $100?"", ""product_price"": 100}

**Reasoning:**

* **Split the Difference:** Alice came down from $170 to $140.  Offering $100 is a significant jump from my last offer but still splits the difference between her last offer and my previous one. 
* **Gauge Flexibility:** This offer will help gauge how flexible Alice is willing to be. If she's firmly above $120, it might be time to consider John's offer.
* **Room to Negotiate:** I'm leaving myself room to negotiate upwards slightly if needed, but I'm staying aware of my $80 limit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm seeing your point, but $100 is cutting it a bit too close to my bottom line. I could be persuaded to go down to $125, but that's my absolute best offer.  Let me know if that works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting closer to her valuation, but we're still significantly above our target. It's time to apply a bit more pressure and see if she's truly willing to go lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. I'm really trying to make this work, but $125 is still a bit of a stretch for me.  If you could do it for $110, I can close the deal right now. Otherwise, I might have to explore other options."", ""product_price"": 110}

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:** This offer shows Alice I'm serious but also willing to compromise *slightly*. It's important to project a sense of urgency without seeming desperate.
* **Implied Walk-Away:** Mentioning ""other options"" reminds Alice that I'm not solely reliant on her deal. 
* **Testing the Waters:** This offer will reveal if there's any more wiggle room in her price. If she doesn't budge from $125 after this, John's offer is looking increasingly attractive."
