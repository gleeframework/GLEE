Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not willing to go any lower than $725,000, Bob. Your offer of $700,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm going to stand firm on this price. If you're willing to meet me at $725,000, I'd be happy to sell it to you.

At this point, Alice is unwilling to budge from $725,000. While it's below her initial offer, it's still more expensive than buying from John for $800,000.  It's time to cut my losses and go with the guaranteed lower price."
