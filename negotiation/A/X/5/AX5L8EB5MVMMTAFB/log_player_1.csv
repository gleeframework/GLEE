Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However,  $1,100,000 is a bit steep for me. Given my research on similar products, I'm willing to pay $950,000.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I will reject Bob's offer. While $950,000 is a good price, I believe I can still negotiate for a higher amount closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. However, $950,000 is a significant drop from my initial asking price. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000, which I believe is a fair compromise that reflects the true value of this product.  This offer stands for 24 hours."",
""product_price"": 1050000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $1,050,000 is still more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,000,000.  This is a fair price considering my research and the value I place on this product.  I'm hoping we can reach an agreement quickly, as I'm running out of time. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob offering $1,000,000 is a good deal. It's a substantial profit above my minimum, and his mention of time constraints suggests he might be willing to walk away if I push further. Accepting now secures a favorable outcome."
