"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm asking for $95, but I'm open to negotiation. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
The product is worth $80 to Alice, and you're willing to pay up to $100. This means there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the first offer will allow you to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $95 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $85, as that's closer to what I'm comfortable with. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more from my initial price. How about $90? It's still a good deal for you, considering the product's worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is still above your ideal price point, but she is willing to negotiate.  Rejecting this offer and making another counteroffer is likely to result in a better price for you."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm willing to go a bit higher. How about $88?  That's a fair price for both of us and gets us closer to a deal."", ""product_price"": 88}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see you're willing to negotiate, and I appreciate that.  $88 is getting closer, but I'm still holding out for $90. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll agree. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

At this point, Alice is sticking to $90. While you might be able to squeeze out a lower price, the risk of reaching the end of the rounds without an agreement means you risk having to buy from John for $100.  Accepting the offer at $90 ensures you get the product at a lower price than John and still within your budget."
