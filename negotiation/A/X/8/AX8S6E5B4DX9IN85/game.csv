"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is significantly below what I need. I'm willing to come down to $16,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you. Let's see if we can reach a deal.",16000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I hear you about your budget, but I'm still a bit far from where I need to be.  I'm willing to come down to $14,000. This is a substantial reduction from my initial offer.  I'm hoping we can find a compromise here.",14000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me. How about we meet in the middle at $12,000? That's a significant increase from my initial offer and shows I'm serious about making a deal.",12000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob,  I understand your position, and I'm willing to make one final concession.  I'll accept $13,000 for the product.  This is a good deal for both of us, and I hope you'll agree. ",13000.0,Alice,7,
