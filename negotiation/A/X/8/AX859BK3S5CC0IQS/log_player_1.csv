Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it would be incredibly valuable to you, and I'm willing to part with it for $10,000."", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always best to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer. 
* **Gauging Interest:** The $10,000 offer will help gauge Bob's interest level. If he accepts immediately, great! If he counters, it means he's interested but wants to negotiate. 
* **Safety Net:** Knowing John will buy the product for $8,000 provides a safety net. If Bob rejects the offer, Alice doesn't lose out."
