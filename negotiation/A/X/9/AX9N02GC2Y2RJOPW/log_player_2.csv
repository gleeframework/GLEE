"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's designed to significantly enhance your business operations and streamline your processes. Given its value to you, I believe it's worth $12,000. Let's discuss how this investment could benefit you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
It's highly unlikely Alice will immediately offer a price that works for me.  I need to negotiate to try and get closer to my budget. It's way too early to buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I agree this product could really help my business. However,  $12,000 is a bit outside my budget right now. Would you be willing to come down to $6,000?"",
""product_price"": 6000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** This is a negotiation tactic to see how flexible Alice is. It's unlikely she'll accept, but it sets a low anchor for the discussion.
* **Polite and Professional:**  Maintaining a positive tone is key to a successful negotiation. 
* **Focus on Value:** While I countered low, I reiterated the product's value to me. This shows I'm serious about buying, just not at her initial price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your interest in our product, Bob. I understand your current budget constraints. To accommodate your needs, I would like to propose an alternative pricing option. How about we consider a price of $9,000 for the product? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Progress:** Alice came down significantly from $12,000 to $9,000, which shows she's willing to negotiate.
* **Room to Negotiate:**  While $9,000 is closer to my budget, it's still above what John offers. I believe I can get a better deal with a few more rounds.  
* **Risk vs. Reward:** There's a risk Alice might not move much further, but the potential savings are worth another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $9,000 is closer, but it's still a bit of a stretch.  Could you meet me halfway at $7,500?"",
""product_price"": 7500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** This counteroffer aims to find a compromise between her $9,000 and my initial $6,000. 
* **Showing Willingness:** Moving closer to her price signals that I am serious about purchasing if we can find the right number.
* **Strategic Positioning:** This offer is getting close to John's price, which gives me leverage in future rounds. If Alice doesn't move much further, I can always go with John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're finding common ground, Bob. Considering your feedback, I propose a price of $8,500 for the product. This reflects a reasonable compromise while still allowing us to cover costs and maintain profitability. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Getting Close:**  Alice is now only $500 above John's price.  
* **Leverage:**  With fewer rounds left, Alice is more likely to make further concessions to avoid losing the sale. 
* **Potential Savings:** Even a small discount from $8,500 is a win at this point. I'm willing to risk one more counteroffer to see if I can get closer to $8,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, you're really close.  To be completely upfront, I have another offer for $8,000.  If you could meet that price, I'd be happy to close the deal with you today."",
""product_price"": 8000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Transparency:** I'm being honest with Alice about the other offer without revealing the specific source. This creates a sense of urgency and highlights the competitiveness of my position.
* **Final Offer:**  This is likely my last offer before going with John. By stating this clearly, I'm signaling that further negotiation might be futile.
* **Maintaining Relationship:** While firm, my message remains respectful and acknowledges Alice's efforts in the negotiation.  Even if she rejects this offer, there's a chance she might counter with a slightly higher but still acceptable price."
