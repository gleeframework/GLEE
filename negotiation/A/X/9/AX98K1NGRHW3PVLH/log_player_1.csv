Send your offer to Bob.","```json

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am looking for a more reasonable price. Would you consider selling it for $12,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price.  While $12,000 is my minimum, I want to see if I can squeeze a bit more out of Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. How about $13,000?  That's a fair price for both of us. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your willingness to negotiate, Alice. I appreciate the reduction. Based on my budget, could you consider selling the product for $12,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While I'd love to get closer to my initial asking price, Bob's offer of $12,500 is a good compromise. It's within my minimum threshold, and I don't want to risk losing the deal and having to sell to John for $12,000."
