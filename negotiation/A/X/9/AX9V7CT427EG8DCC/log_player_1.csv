"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm offering the product to Bob for $110. This is a price that is still a decent profit for me, but hopefully attractive enough for Bob to consider.  I'm leaving some room for negotiation in case he makes a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $100 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get him to come up a little bit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

I'm going to counter with $105.  This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still leaves me with a decent profit.  Hopefully, Bob will see this as a fair price and accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$95 is still too low for me. I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can get him to go higher.  I'm starting to get concerned that I might not be able to get a price I'm comfortable with, but I'm still not ready to give up on this deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

I'm going to stick to my guns and counter with $100.  This is my final offer before I'm prepared to walk away and sell to John.  I'm hoping Bob will recognize that I'm serious and accept this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I've reached my limit with Bob.  He's not willing to come up to my minimum price.  I'm going to sell the product to John for $120.  It's not the best possible outcome, but it's still a good profit and I don't want to risk losing more money by continuing to negotiate with Bob."
