Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $8000 is a significant discount from my initial price, but I'm still not willing to sell it for that low. Considering the product's value and rarity, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering $14000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.
