Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $20000. I think this is a fair price considering its value and rarity. What do you think?,20000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, while I appreciate the offer, $20000 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend. I'm interested in this product, but my budget is much lower. I'm prepared to offer $8000 for it. This is a fair price considering I'm ready to purchase immediately. Let me know if you're interested in negotiating.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $8000 is a significant discount from my initial price, but I'm still not willing to sell it for that low. Considering the product's value and rarity, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering $14000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $14000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $10000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. I believe this is a fair compromise, and I'm eager to close the deal. Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that you're willing to meet me halfway, and I appreciate that. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $10000. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to get closer to my initial price. I'm counteroffering $12500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",12500.0,Alice,5,
