Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate the offer, $20000 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend. I'm interested in this product, but my budget is much lower. I'm prepared to offer $8000 for it. This is a fair price considering I'm ready to purchase immediately. Let me know if you're interested in negotiating.
