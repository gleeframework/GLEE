{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000.  This is a great price considering its value to me.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$1,000,000:** This price is a compromise between my minimum value of $1,200,000 and Bob's value of $800,000. It gives Bob a significant discount while still allowing me to earn a substantial profit.
* **Message:**  The message is friendly and emphasizes the value proposition for Bob, while also setting a firm price. 

**Strategy:**

By starting with a strong offer, I hope to encourage Bob to negotiate seriously. If he rejects, I can then assess his counteroffer and decide whether to accept, counter again, or sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $900,000 for your product. I believe this price reflects a fair compromise between its value to you and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $900,000 is closer to my desired price than Bob's initial offer, it's still below my minimum value of $1,200,000. I'm not desperate to sell, and I have a guaranteed alternative with John. 

**Strategy:**

I'll reject Bob's offer and try to push him closer to my desired price. It's important to maintain a firm stance, especially considering I have a backup option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $900,000 is still a bit below what I need to make this work. I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This is a fair compromise, and it allows us both to benefit from this deal."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$950,000:** This price is a compromise that allows me to make some profit while still being more appealing to Bob. It's a significant increase from his previous offer but still below my ideal price.
* **Message:** I emphasize my willingness to compromise while also highlighting the benefits of the deal for both of us.

**Strategy:**

I'm attempting to find a middle ground that's acceptable to both of us. By offering a compromise, I'm hoping to encourage Bob to accept my counteroffer. If he rejects again, I'll have to reassess my options and potentially consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Alice. I understand your position, but I must stick to my budget. I am willing to pay $925,000 for your product. This price represents a reasonable compromise for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $925,000 is still below my minimum value of $1,200,000.  While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm not willing to accept a price that leaves me significantly less than what I consider a fair return.  

**Strategy:**

I've already made several concessions.  I believe I've reached a point where further negotiation is unlikely to lead to a satisfactory price for me.  Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) who is willing to pay my minimum price, I'm choosing to sell the product to him."
