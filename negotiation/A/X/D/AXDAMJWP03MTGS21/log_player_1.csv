Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Knowing its value, I believe a price of $1,350,000 is fair. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed sale at $1,500,000, aiming higher with Bob could yield a better return.
* **Strategic Pricing:**  The $1,350,000 offer is significantly above Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000) but still offers him a substantial discount compared to your backup offer.
* **Urgency and Scarcity:** By mentioning ""other interested parties"" and a ""limited-time offer,"" you introduce a sense of urgency and scarcity, potentially influencing Bob to act quickly.

**Outcome:**

* **If Bob Accepts:** You make a profit of $350,000 over your minimum.
* **If Bob Rejects:** You sell to John at your guaranteed price, still achieving your goal."
