It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice to see if you can get a better price.  $850,000 is above your target, so you should try to counteroffer."

Alice's offer:

Alice is getting closer to your target price, but $825,000 is still above your budget. It's worth trying another counteroffer to see if you can get closer to your goal."
