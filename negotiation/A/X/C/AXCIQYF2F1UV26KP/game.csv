"I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a unique opportunity to acquire a high-value item that will bring you great benefits. I'm willing to start with a price of $9,200, which is a fair and reasonable offer considering its worth to you.",9200.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay closer to $7,000. What do you think?",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $7,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $8,500, which is still a great deal for you considering the product's value to you.",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $8,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to increase my offer to $7,500.  That's a fair compromise, don't you think?",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're getting too far apart. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. I'm counteroffering at $8,000, which is the lowest I'm willing to go. I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",8000.0,Alice,5,
