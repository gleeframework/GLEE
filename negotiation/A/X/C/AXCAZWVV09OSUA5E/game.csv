"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to make a compromise, but I need to stay within my budget. Let me know if that's something you'd be willing to consider.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, $9,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,000, which still gives you a great deal. Let's meet halfway.",10000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $9,500. Would you be willing to accept that?",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm getting a bit frustrated with this back and forth. While I understand your budget, $9,500 is still quite a bit lower than what I'm hoping for. I'm willing to compromise one last time, but I'm sticking to $10,000. If you're truly interested, this is our final offer. ",10000.0,Alice,5,
