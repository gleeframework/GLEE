Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 200}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $200. This gives me a good margin, and hopefully, Bob will see the value in the product. If he rejects, I'll be prepared to negotiate but I'll always keep John's offer of $150 as my fallback option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is my floor price, I'm not willing to settle just yet. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer. There's still a chance Bob might be willing to pay more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}
```

I'm going to counter with $175. It's a compromise that hopefully shows Bob I'm willing to negotiate, but still leaves some room for profit. If he rejects again, I might consider selling to John to avoid wasting too much time."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $160
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $160 is only $10 less than my counteroffer, and it's a decent amount over my minimum.  It's worth it to accept rather than risk going back and forth again."
