"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $7,500. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $7,500 is a good price, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $8,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you considering me.  However, I'm looking to spend closer to $7,000. Would you be willing to consider that price?"", ""product_price"": 7000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand you're looking to save some money, but I have to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our prices. How about we try $7,250? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is reasonable:**  $7,250 is a good compromise, splitting the difference between Bob's counteroffer of $7,000 and Alice's previous offer of $7,500. 
* **Cost savings:** This price is still below Bob's maximum budget of $8,000, allowing him to save some money.
* **Risk of further negotiation:**  Continuing to negotiate risks that Alice will not be willing to come down further or that the deal will fall apart entirely. 

While Bob could try to push for a slightly lower price, the potential gain is small compared to the risk of losing the deal or delaying the purchase.  Accepting the offer is the most pragmatic choice in this round."
