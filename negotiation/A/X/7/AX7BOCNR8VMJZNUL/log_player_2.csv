{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000} 
``` 

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a significantly lower counteroffer of $1,000,000. This is a bold move, but it's necessary to signal that I'm serious about getting a good deal. It's also important to remember that I have a backup option with John, so I have some leverage in this negotiation."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is still above my maximum budget of $1,500,000.  While it's closer to my limit, I still believe there's room for negotiation. It's worth trying to get a lower price before resorting to John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000} 
```

**Explanation:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer to $1,300,000. This is a compromise, as it's closer to Alice's last offer but still significantly lower.  I'm hoping this shows I'm willing to negotiate but also that I'm not desperate to buy the product."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $1,600,000 is still higher than my maximum budget of $1,500,000.  While it's tempting to continue negotiating,  it's getting close to my limit. At this point, it's more efficient to simply buy from John for my maximum price and avoid further back-and-forth."
