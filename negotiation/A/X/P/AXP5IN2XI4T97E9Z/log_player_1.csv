I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's tempting to sell to him for $1,100,000, I believe I can get a better price by continuing negotiations."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $1,250,000?  This price still leaves you a good profit margin, and it's fair for me considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 1250000}

Round 4

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While it's tempting to accept and make a small profit, I believe I can still negotiate a better price.  It's worth holding out a few more rounds to see if we can get closer to my desired price."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Let's try $1,225,000. This is a good compromise for both of us and still allows you a healthy profit margin.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1225000}

Round 6
