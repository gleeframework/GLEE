{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000.  It's a great deal for you, and it's a fair price considering its value. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's high enough to be potentially appealing to Bob, but still leaves room for negotiation. It's important to remember that you have a fallback option with John, so you don't need to settle for anything less than $1,200,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time and consideration, Alice. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $900,000 is closer to my minimum, I still have a better option with John. I'm going to counteroffer Bob to see if I can get closer to my goal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little further, but I'm hoping we can settle on $950,000. This would be a great deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're trying to find a sweet spot, Alice. However, $950,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I was thinking more along the lines of $925,000. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While $925,000 is getting closer to my desired price, it's still not enough. I've already had a few rounds of negotiation with Bob, and it seems he's not willing to budge much further. Since I have a guaranteed buyer in John who's willing to pay my minimum, I'm going to take the safe route and sell to John for $1,200,000."
