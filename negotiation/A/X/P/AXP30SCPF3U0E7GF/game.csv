"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1500000. I think this is a fair price considering its value and rarity.",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1500000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in this product, and I'm willing to pay $1000000 for it.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1000000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to consider a compromise. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1350000. This is a significant discount from my original offer, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1350000 is still a bit higher than what I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $1150000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the fact that I have another buyer waiting. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1150000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to negotiate a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1150000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $1275000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great value for the product.",1275000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1275000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $1200000, which is a significant step up from my previous offer. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",1200000.0,Bob,6,
