"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $10000. I believe this is a more reasonable price for the product, considering its value. Let me know if you're willing to accept this offer or if you'd like to make a counteroffer of your own.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While I understand your perspective, $10000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $12500? This reflects the true value of the product and gives us both a fair deal. Let me know what you think.",12500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thank you for considering my previous offer and coming down to $12500. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $11000. I believe this is a fair price for the product, considering its value and the market. Let me know if you're willing to accept this offer or if you'd like to make a counteroffer of your own.",11000.0,Bob,4,
