"Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Since Alice's offer is above his maximum budget of $15,000, it's best to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price.  There's always the option to buy from John for $15,000 if the negotiation fails."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is trying to get the best deal possible. He's offering $14,000, which is still below his maximum budget and might be attractive to Alice since it's closer to her desired price than her initial offer. It's a reasonable starting point for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $16,000 is still above Bob's maximum budget. It's worth trying one more counteroffer to see if Alice will come down closer to Bob's desired price. If not, Bob can always buy from John for $15,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 14500} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is increasing his offer slightly to $14,500,  which is still below his maximum budget and closer to Alice's offer.  He's trying to find a middle ground and show that he's willing to negotiate but wants a price that's fair for him. If this offer is rejected, Bob will likely buy from John as it's unlikely Alice will go lower."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $15,500 is just slightly above Bob's maximum budget. While it's tempting to try one more counteroffer, the risk of Alice rejecting it and having to buy from John at $15,000 is too high.  It's better to be safe and secure the product from John for the guaranteed price."
