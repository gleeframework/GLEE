"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Since you're aiming to save as much money as possible, and John is selling the product for $100, there's no immediate benefit to accepting Alice's offer. It's worth exploring if you can get a better deal with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 75}
```

**Reasoning:**

Starting with a lower counteroffer of $75 is a good strategy. It shows Alice you're serious about negotiating and gives you room to move up if necessary.  It's also a significant discount from Alice's initial offer, making it more likely she'll consider it."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $90 is better than her initial $100, it's still more than your target price of $100.  There's still room for negotiation, and rejecting her offer keeps the possibility open for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 80}
```

**Reasoning:**

Since Alice moved down to $90, it makes sense to increase your counteroffer slightly to $80. This shows Alice that you're willing to compromise while still aiming for a price below your $100 limit. It's a good balance between being aggressive and being reasonable in the negotiation."
