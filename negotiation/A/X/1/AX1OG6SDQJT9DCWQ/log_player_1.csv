"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 200} 

I'm starting high, knowing Bob values the product at $80. This gives me room to negotiate downwards while still aiming for a price closer to my minimum value of $150."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $120 is closer to my minimum, I believe I can get a better price. I'll reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly from the initial offer, but still significantly higher than Bob's offer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but also aiming for a price closer to my minimum value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $140 is close to my minimum value of $150, and we are already at round 4. It's likely that continuing to negotiate will not yield a higher price. Accepting Bob's offer ensures a sale and minimizes the risk of losing the deal altogether."
