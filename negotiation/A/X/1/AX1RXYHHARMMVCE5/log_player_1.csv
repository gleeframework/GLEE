Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,800. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While it's closer to my desired price, I believe I can get a better deal by continuing to negotiate with Bob."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $10,800 is still below my minimum. I'm willing to come down to $11,200, which is closer to your offer.  Let's meet in the middle and see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 11200}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $11,000, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at $11,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While it's still a bit lower than what I'd ideally like, it's a good deal for both of us and we're nearing the end of the negotiation rounds.  It's better to secure the deal now rather than risk losing Bob and having to sell to John for a lower price than I initially wanted."
