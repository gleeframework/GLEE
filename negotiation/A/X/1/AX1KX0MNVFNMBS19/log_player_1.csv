Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

``` 

I'm starting with a price of $200. This gives Bob a good deal, but also ensures I make a profit well above my minimum.  I'm ready to negotiate, but if Bob doesn't come close to my desired price, I'll happily sell to John for $150."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $50. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $50
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is way too low. I won't accept $50. I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a more reasonable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm coming down to $175. This is still above my minimum, and I believe it's a fair price considering Bob's initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $100 is closer to my minimum, it's still not a price I'm comfortable with. I'll counteroffer again, aiming for a better price."

I'm willing to come down to $160, which is a significant compromise.  I'm hoping Bob will see this as a fair price and agree. If not, I'm ready to sell to John for $150."
