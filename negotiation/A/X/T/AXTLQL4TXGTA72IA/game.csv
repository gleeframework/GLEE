"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to go up to $9000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. I'm starting to think about buying from John, but I'd rather negotiate with you if possible. What do you think?",9000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $10500 is still a bit above your budget, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more compromise. I can offer it to you for $10000.
