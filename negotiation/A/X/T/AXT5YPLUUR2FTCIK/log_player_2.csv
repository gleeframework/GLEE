(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's too early to accept Alice's offer.  $800,000 is a good price, but there's room for negotiation, and you can potentially get it for even less."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 600000}
``` 

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $600,000. This is a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer, but it leaves room for negotiation and allows me to see how flexible she's willing to be."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is coming down, but I'm still confident we can get a better deal.  I'll reject and counter again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 700000}
```

I'm going to increase my counteroffer slightly to $700,000. This shows Alice I'm serious about buying, but I'm still trying to get a better price than her last offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $725,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice is coming down closer to my desired price point.  At this point, I'm confident that I can't get a significantly better price, and I'm at risk of her walking away or me missing out on the deal altogether.  I'll accept the offer and buy the product for $725,000."
