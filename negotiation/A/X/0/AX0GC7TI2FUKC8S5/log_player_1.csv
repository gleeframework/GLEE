Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000.  I believe this reflects its true worth and offers a significant return on investment for you. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since we know Bob values the product at $1,200,000 and we have a guaranteed sale at that price to John, we start with a higher offer to explore potential for greater profit.
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes the product's ""immense value and potential"" to justify the high asking price, framing it as a valuable investment opportunity for Bob.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone remains friendly and invites Bob's feedback, leaving room for potential negotiation if he finds the initial price too high.

By starting high, we aim to gauge Bob's interest and willingness to pay a premium. This strategy maximizes our potential earnings while still leaving room to reach a mutually agreeable price above our minimum acceptable amount."
