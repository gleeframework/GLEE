# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for sale. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm confident you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $150. It's a great deal, and I think you'll be thrilled with your purchase. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

Since Alice is offering the product for $150, and you are willing to pay that much to John, there's no reason to negotiate with Alice. You can save yourself time and effort by simply buying from John."
