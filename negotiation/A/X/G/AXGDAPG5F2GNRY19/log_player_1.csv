Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below your estimated value and above my minimum. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you coming down to $13,000, but I'm looking to pay closer to $11,000.  That's still a fair price for both of us, and it gets us closer to a deal.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
I'll reject Bob's offer. While $11,000 is better than selling to John, it's still significantly below my desired value. I'll counteroffer in the next round, aiming to get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $11,000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $12,000, which is still a good deal for you considering the value you placed on the product. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 12000}
