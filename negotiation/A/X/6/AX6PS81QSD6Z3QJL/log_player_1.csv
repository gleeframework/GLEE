Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair starting point considering its potential benefits to you. What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 1100000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I recognize the product's value, that price point is a little too high for me. I'd be willing to consider purchasing it for $650,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your reply. I understand your perspective, but $650,000 is significantly below its true worth and what I'm willing to accept.  Could you consider a figure closer to $950,000? This feels like a more reasonable compromise."", ""product_price"": 950000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $950,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $800,000? That's a fair offer considering John is offering me the same deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is revealing that John is offering him a similar product for $800,000.  This means there's no incentive for Bob to go higher, and he might even try to push the price lower in future rounds. Since you have a guaranteed offer from John for $1,200,000, it's in your best interest to take the sure thing and maximize your profit."
