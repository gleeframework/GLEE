Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm offering it to you for $175. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Offering $175 gives room for negotiation while still leaving a profit margin for myself. 
* **Positive Tone:**  A friendly message helps build rapport and encourages Bob to consider the offer.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The message clearly indicates that I'm willing to negotiate, which is important to keep Bob engaged. 
* **John as Backup:** Knowing John is willing to pay $150 provides a safety net if negotiations with Bob fall through."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $175 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $100 for it.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $100 is below my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Negotiation Opportunity:**  Bob's willingness to negotiate gives me a chance to find a price that works for both of us.  
* **John's offer as a safety net:**  Knowing John is willing to pay $150 allows me to be firm in my counteroffer without fear of losing out entirely."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate you making a counteroffer.  While $100 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $125.  This price still gives me a fair margin, and it's significantly closer to your offer.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 125}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  My counteroffer of $125 is a significant compromise from my initial offer, showing willingness to negotiate.
* **Justification:**  The message provides a reason for the counteroffer, explaining that it's a fair margin for me while also being closer to Bob's offer.
* **Maintaining a Profit Margin:**  $125 is still above my minimum acceptable price, ensuring I don't lose money on the deal. 
* **Positive and Encouraging:**  The tone remains friendly and encouraging, making Bob more likely to continue negotiating."
