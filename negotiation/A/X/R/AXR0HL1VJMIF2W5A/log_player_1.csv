{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident it's worth the price. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly above my minimum, hoping to leave room for negotiation while still getting a good return.  I'm also being friendly and trying to build a positive rapport."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $9,000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $7,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
