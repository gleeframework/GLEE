,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're interested in the product, but $9,000 is significantly below my asking price.  How about we split the difference?  I'm willing to come down to $10,500.  What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,000 and $10,500. How about we try $9,750?",9750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your flexibility, but $9,750 is still a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference again? I'm willing to come down to $10,125.  This would be a fair compromise, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us.  What do you say?",10125.0,Alice,5,

"I understand that $10,125 is still a bit above my budget, but I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we try $9,800?",9800.0,Bob,6,
