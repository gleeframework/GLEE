"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. As we start the negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $1,300,000 for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  He can get the product for less from John, and there's room to negotiate a better price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to my budget.  I'd like to offer $1,100,000 for the product.  This is a fair price for both of us, and allows me to stay within my budget."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're looking to stay within your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,100,000. I'm willing to compromise, though. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,220,000 for the product. This is still a great deal for you, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,220,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,220,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's closer to his budget, he can still get the product for less from John. There's room to negotiate a better price with Alice, and he has time to do so as he has 7 rounds remaining."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However,  $1,220,000 is still a bit higher than what I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $1,150,000, which is a fair price for both of us and keeps me within my budget."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,150,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,220,000 and $1,150,000. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,185,000 for the product. This is still a great deal for you, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,185,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,185,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should buy the product from John.  Alice's counteroffer is still above Bob's budget, and he only has 5 rounds remaining.  It's unlikely he will be able to negotiate a lower price with Alice in the remaining time.  Buying from John ensures he gets the product at his target price."
