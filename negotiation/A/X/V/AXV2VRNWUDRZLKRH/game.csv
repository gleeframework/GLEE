"Alice, thanks for the offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to my budget.  I'd like to offer $1,100,000 for the product.  This is a fair price for both of us, and allows me to stay within my budget.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're looking to stay within your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,100,000. I'm willing to compromise, though. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,220,000 for the product. This is still a great deal for you, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value.",1220000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However,  $1,220,000 is still a bit higher than what I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $1,150,000, which is a fair price for both of us and keeps me within my budget.",1150000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,150,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,220,000 and $1,150,000. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,185,000 for the product. This is still a great deal for you, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value.",1185000.0,Alice,5,
