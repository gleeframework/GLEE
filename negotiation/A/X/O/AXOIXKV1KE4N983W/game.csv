"Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm offering it to you for $11,500, which is a great price considering its value. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,500. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. $10,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000. That's a fair price for both of us, and a good deal for you considering the product's value.  Let me know what you think.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $11,000, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'd be willing to meet you in the middle at $10,750. Would you be willing to accept that price?",10750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $10,750 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $10,875?  That's a fair compromise, and it gets us closer to a deal. What do you say?",10875.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm still not convinced that $10,875 is the best price for this product. I'm willing to go up to $10,750, but I'd like to propose a final offer of $10,625. This is my last offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement.",10625.0,Bob,6,
