"Bob, I understand your perspective. While I appreciate your offer, $1050000 is a bit too low for me at this point.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $1100000.  This price still allows you to make a profit, and it's closer to what I need to make this deal work for me. Let's keep the negotiation moving forward.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
