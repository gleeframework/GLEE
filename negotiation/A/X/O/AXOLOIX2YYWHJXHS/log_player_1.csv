"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,800,000. It's a fantastic deal, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset for you. Let's see if we can make this work!"", ""product_price"": 1800000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price higher than what the product is worth to Bob, but still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Positive message:** I'm framing the offer as a positive opportunity for Bob, emphasizing its value.
* **Open to negotiation:** I'm expressing my willingness to negotiate, which might encourage Bob to counteroffer.

**Next Steps:**

I'll closely analyze Bob's response and adjust my strategy based on his counteroffer, or if he rejects my initial offer.  I'm prepared to make concessions, but I won't go below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. If the negotiations stall or I don't feel confident about reaching a deal, I can always turn to John and secure my guaranteed price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,800,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product,  which is still a fair price for its value. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $1,000,000 is far below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. Accepting this offer would result in a significant loss.
* **Potential for negotiation:**  While Bob's initial offer is unacceptable,  he's shown a willingness to negotiate. I believe there's still room to find a middle ground.
* **Maintaining leverage:**  Rejecting his offer keeps my leverage and allows me to make a counteroffer. 

**Next Steps:**

I will counteroffer with a price higher than Bob's offer, but still below my initial price. I'll try to find a price that's appealing to Bob while ensuring I still make a profit.  I'll also continue to monitor the progress and consider selling to John if negotiations with Bob become unproductive or drag on too long."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,000,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. This price reflects the true value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us. Let's find common ground and close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1600000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a lower price:** I'm lowering my price from $1,800,000 to $1,600,000. This shows a willingness to compromise while still ensuring a profit for myself.
* **Emphasize value and fairness:** I'm reiterating the value of the product and framing the counteroffer as a fair deal for both parties. This aims to appeal to Bob's sense of reason and encourage him to accept.
* **Open to negotiation:** I'm explicitly saying ""Let's find common ground"", indicating my openness to further discussion.

**Next Steps:**

I'll carefully observe Bob's response to this counteroffer. If he rejects it, I will continue to negotiate, aiming for a price closer to $1,500,000, but only if I believe there's a chance of securing a deal. However, I'm always prepared to walk away and sell to John if negotiations become unproductive or if I'm concerned about running out of time."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,600,000 is still above my budget. I'm prepared to offer $1,200,000 for the product. This reflects a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price that allows us both to come to an agreement.  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** $1,200,000 is significantly less than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. Accepting would mean a considerable loss.
* **Limited room for negotiation:** While Bob has shown a willingness to compromise, the gap between our desired prices is still substantial.  
* **Maintain leverage:** Rejecting his offer allows me to maintain leverage and control the negotiation.

**Next Steps:**

I'll need to carefully weigh my options. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round, but I'll need to be strategic. I need to find a price that's appealing to Bob while still allowing me to earn a reasonable profit. If Bob continues to reject offers, I'll have to seriously consider selling to John to secure my guaranteed price, especially if the rounds are limited."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $1,200,000 simply doesn't cover the value of this product.  I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000, which is a significant compromise on my end.  This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us.  Let's work together to close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moderate Compromise:** I'm lowering my price from $1,600,000 to $1,400,000. This shows flexibility and a willingness to meet halfway, but still maintains a profit margin above my minimum acceptable price.
* **Emphasize Value and Fairness:**  I'm continuing to emphasize the product's value and framing the offer as a fair deal. This appeals to Bob's sense of reason and encourages a positive response.
* **Direct and Actionable:**  I'm making a direct offer with a clear price point and stating my desire to close the deal. 

**Next Steps:**

I'll closely monitor Bob's response. If he rejects this offer, I'll need to reconsider my strategy.  The gap between our desired prices is narrowing, but I'm concerned about running out of time.  If negotiations don't progress, I'll seriously consider selling to John and securing my guaranteed $1,500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  I see your willingness to compromise, and I appreciate it.  However, $1,400,000 is still a bit higher than I can comfortably afford.  I'm prepared to offer $1,300,000. This is a strong price point that I believe reflects the product's value while staying within my budget.  Let's work together to close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** $1,300,000 is below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. Accepting would mean a considerable loss.
* **Limited time:**  With only four rounds left, time is running out. I need to carefully consider my options.
* **Potential for a deal:** Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum price, and he's showing a willingness to negotiate. 

**Next Steps:**

I will make a counteroffer in the next round, aiming for a price closer to $1,400,000 or potentially even $1,450,000.  However, if Bob continues to reject my offers, I will seriously consider selling to John to secure my guaranteed $1,500,000.  I need to balance my desire for a higher price with the risk of losing the deal altogether."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued interest and your willingness to negotiate. $1,300,000 is a step in the right direction, but still falls short of what I need to make this deal work.  I'm prepared to come down to $1,450,000.  This price acknowledges the value of the product and represents a fair compromise for both of us.  Let's work together to finalize this agreement."", ""product_price"": 1450000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Counter:** I'm raising my counteroffer slightly from $1,400,000 to $1,450,000. This shows I'm still willing to negotiate, but it also maintains a position closer to my minimum acceptable price.
* **Time Pressure:** With only three rounds left, I'm trying to push for a deal while still protecting my profit margin. 
* **Positive Tone:** I'm maintaining a positive tone, emphasizing collaboration and mutual benefit. This could encourage Bob to accept.

**Next Steps:**

I'm carefully watching Bob's response. If he rejects this offer, I'll have to seriously consider selling to John.  While I'd prefer to close with Bob, I'm running out of time and need to ensure a profitable outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. While $1,450,000 is closer to what I can afford, I need to stay within my budget. I'm offering $1,350,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us both to come to an agreement. Let's see if we can close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is running out:** We are now in Round 8, leaving only two rounds remaining.
* **Significant Price Gap:**  Even though Bob's offer is closer,  $1,350,000 is still $150,000 below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Risk of Losing the Deal:**  There is a high risk that Bob will continue to reject offers, especially as we approach the final rounds. 

**Next Steps:**

I've decided to sell to John and secure the guaranteed $1,500,000.  While I would have liked to make a higher profit, the risk of losing the deal entirely is too great.  It's important to balance my desire for a higher price with the need to ensure a profitable outcome."
