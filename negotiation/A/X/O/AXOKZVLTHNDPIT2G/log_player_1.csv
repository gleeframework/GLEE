"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $175.  It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very useful.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Tone:** Using a friendly and positive tone can help build rapport and encourage Bob to consider the offer.
* **Value Proposition:** I'm highlighting the potential value of the product to Bob, making it more appealing.

**Strategy:**

This initial offer sets the stage for a negotiation. I'm aiming to gauge Bob's interest and potentially get him to make a counteroffer. If he rejects outright, I'll need to adjust my strategy based on his reaction and the remaining rounds.  The option to sell to John for $150 provides a safety net if the negotiation with Bob fails."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but $175 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Counteroffer:** Bob's offer of $120 is significantly lower than my minimum desired price of $150. 
* **Negotiation Strategy:**  While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm not going to give away the product for less than what it's worth to me. 
* **Maintaining Position:** Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to maintain my position and potentially secure a better deal. 

**Next Steps:**

I will counter with a price that is closer to my desired price point but still leaves room for compromise. The goal is to find a price that's acceptable to both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $120 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down a bit.  How about $160? This would still allow me to get a fair price for the product, and I believe it's still a good deal for you considering its value.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 160}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm countering with a price that's closer to my desired price point of $150 but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Finding a Middle Ground:**  I'm trying to find a price that is a compromise between my minimum price and Bob's offer.
* **Value Justification:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value and the benefits he'll get from buying it.

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer shows Bob that I'm willing to negotiate but I'm not going to settle for a price that's significantly below my minimum. By offering a price close to my desired value, I'm hoping to encourage Bob to accept the deal or at least make a more reasonable counteroffer. If he rejects this offer, I'll have to re-evaluate my options based on the remaining rounds and the risk of selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down to $160, but I'm still a bit far from my budget. I'd be willing to meet you halfway between $120 and $160, which would be $140. Would you be open to that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Counteroffer:**  Bob's offer of $140 is still below my minimum desired price of $150. While it's closer, it's not a price I can accept.
* **Negotiation Strategy:** I need to maintain my position to potentially secure a better deal closer to my desired price.
* **Risk Assessment:**  The risk of selling to John is still present. I'll need to weigh the potential of a better offer from Bob against the guaranteed $150 from John.

**Next Steps:**

I will counter with a price that's closer to my minimum but still leaves room for negotiation. I'm aiming to find a price that balances the risk of selling to John with the potential of a more favorable deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your flexibility.  $140 is closer, but it's still just a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway between my last offer and yours, at $150.  This is my absolute minimum, but I believe it's still a fair price given the product's value.  Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 150}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer at Minimum:** This offer is my minimum acceptable price. It's a firm but fair position considering the product's value and Bob's budget.
* **Finality:** I'm framing this offer as my final attempt to find a mutually agreeable price.  
* **Emphasizing Value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's worth to encourage him to see the value in accepting this offer.

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer presents a clear and decisive position. It gives Bob a final chance to accept a price close to my minimum, while reminding him that selling to John is always an option.  It's a high-stakes round that will determine the outcome of the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $150 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $145, but that's as high as I can go. Would you be willing to accept that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $145
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** Bob's offer of $145 is very close to my minimum of $150. It's tempting to accept, but I have a few rounds left and I want to see if I can push for that last $5.
* **Potential for Higher Offer:** I'm not sure if Bob will go any higher, but the possibility exists. It's worth risking one more round to see if I can close the deal at a more favorable price.
* **Limited Time:** With only 4 rounds left, the risk of selling to John is becoming more apparent. However, I'm still hopeful that I can get a slightly better deal with Bob. 

**Next Steps:**

I will counter with a price slightly higher than Bob's offer. This will likely be my final offer, but I'm hoping Bob will see the value in closing the deal. If he rejects again, I'll have to weigh the potential of a future counteroffer against the guaranteed $150 from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still a bit away from my minimum. I'm willing to make one last concession and accept $147 for the product. It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close this deal. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 147}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Compromise:** This is my final offer, a compromise that's closer to Bob's last offer but still above my minimum.
* **Emphasis on Fairness:**  I'm framing this as a mutually beneficial solution, highlighting the fairness for both parties.
* **Limited Rounds:** With only 3 rounds remaining, I'm pushing for a quick resolution to avoid the risk of selling to John.

**Strategy:**

This offer is a calculated risk. It's a strong compromise that could potentially close the deal, but it leaves little room for further negotiation. If Bob rejects, I'll have to make a critical decision: sell to John for the guaranteed $150 or risk further negotiation with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your last concession, but $147 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $145 and $147, which would be $146. That's the highest price I'm willing to pay. Let me know if that's acceptable to you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $146. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $146
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is Running Out:** We're down to the final three rounds. This means I'm at a high risk of not getting a better price from Bob.
* **Limited Room for Negotiation:**  The gap between my minimum price and Bob's offer is extremely small. There's no guarantee that Bob will raise his offer further. 
* **Risk Mitigation:** Selling to John provides a guaranteed profit of $150, which is closer to my desired price point.

**Strategy:**

With limited time remaining, and only a $1 difference between my desired price and Bob's offer, the risk of further negotiation is not worth the potential loss of profit. The guaranteed $150 from John is the safest and most sensible option at this stage."
