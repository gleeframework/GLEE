,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1400000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1100000 for the product. This reflects the value I see in it, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1100000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to my asking price.  I'm offering $1300000. It's a fair compromise that allows both of us to benefit from this deal. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1300000 is still a bit too much for me. I'm willing to go up to $1200000, which I believe is a fair compromise given the value of the product. Let's try to find common ground and get this deal done.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1200000 is still below my minimum. I'm willing to meet you halfway. My final counteroffer is $1250000. This is a significant reduction from my initial price, and I believe it's a fair offer for both of us.  Let's close this deal.",1250000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your effort to find common ground. However, $1250000 is still outside of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1150000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. This is my final offer, as I'm committed to staying within my budget. If this doesn't work for you, I'll need to explore other options.",1150000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand your constraints, but $1150000 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to make one final compromise to close this deal.  My counteroffer is $1200000.  This is a fair price that considers both our needs and allows us to move forward.  If you're not comfortable with this, I'll need to explore other options.",1200000.0,Alice,7,
