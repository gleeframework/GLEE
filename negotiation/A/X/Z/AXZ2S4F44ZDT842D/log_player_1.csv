Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested, but $110 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with. Would you be willing to do $95?  I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
