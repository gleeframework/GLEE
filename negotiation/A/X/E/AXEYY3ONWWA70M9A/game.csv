"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the price of $2000000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1500000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",1500000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I have to consider the value I've put into this product, and I'm not willing to go as low as $1500000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $1750000. Is this a price you'd be comfortable with?",1750000.0,Alice,3,
