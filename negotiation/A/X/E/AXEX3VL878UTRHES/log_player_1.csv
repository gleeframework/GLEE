Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 11500} 

I'm starting with a price that is a bit above my minimum, but still leaves room for negotiation.  This gives Bob some incentive to bargain, but also shows him that I'm serious about getting a good price.  I'm confident that I can still get a better price than John's offer if the negotiation goes well."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While it's closer to my ideal price, I'm confident I can still get a better price.  I'll counter with a slightly lower price in the next round, hoping to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11250}
```

I'm counteroffering with $11,250. This is a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's offer. It shows him that I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm still determined to get a price that's fair to me. I'm hoping this will get us closer to an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob has come back with his original offer of $11,000. While this is not my ideal price, it is still better than selling to John. I believe that continuing to negotiate might lead to a stalemate, or worse, might even cause Bob to walk away entirely.  Therefore, I am accepting his offer and closing the deal."
