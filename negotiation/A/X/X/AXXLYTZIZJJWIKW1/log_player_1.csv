Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at the special price of $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", 
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  I want to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($80) as possible without going below my minimum ($120).
* **Create Urgency:** The ""limited time"" phrase adds a bit of pressure for Bob to make a decision.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** While unlikely, starting slightly below my minimum allows for the possibility of Bob countering with a slightly higher offer.

**Important Note:** Even if Bob rejects this offer, I'm guaranteed to sell the product to John for $120, ensuring I don't lose money."
