Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the value in this product, $1,500,000 is a bit steep for me at the moment.  I'm willing to pay $1,200,000, which I believe is a fair price considering its potential.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.
