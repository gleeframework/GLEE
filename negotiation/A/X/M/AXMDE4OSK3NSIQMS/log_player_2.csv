"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to acquire a valuable product that holds significant potential for your business. I understand you may not be familiar with its full worth, but I'm confident it could be a game-changer for you. I'm willing to let it go for $950000, which is a price I believe reflects its true value and offers you a significant return on investment. Please consider this offer carefully, as it won't be available for long. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly lower than your maximum budget of $1,200,000.  Accepting this offer saves you $250,000, which is a substantial amount.  While you don't know the true value of the product, the risk of missing out on a potential bargain outweighs the risk of overpaying."
