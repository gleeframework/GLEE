"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. I think this is a great deal, considering its true value is worth much more to me. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is quite a bit higher than I had in mind. This product would be valuable to me, but closer to $6,000 would be more realistic. What do you think?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $12,000 might be a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer it to you for $9,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, considering the product's true value to me. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. How about we settle on $7,500?  That feels like a fair compromise.",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $7,500 is a good compromise, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for that price. I'll offer you a new price of $8,500. This is the closest I can get to meeting you in the middle. What do you think?",8500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're getting close! I'm willing to make this work, but $8,500 is a bit of a stretch. How about $7,800?  That's a very competitive offer.",7800.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $7,800 is a competitive offer, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for that price. I'll offer you a new price of $8,200. This is the highest I'm willing to go, considering the product's true value to me. What do you think?",8200.0,Alice,7,
