"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high price of $1,500,000. This gives me room to negotiate down if Bob makes a counteroffer. It's also a substantial amount above my minimum, demonstrating the value I place on the product.  I'm hoping to get as close to my ideal price as possible in the early rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,200,000 is my minimum, I'm hoping to get a better price. I'm not going to sell to John yet because there's still potential for a better deal with Bob. I'm going to try to get closer to my ideal price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000} 
```

I'm going to counteroffer Bob with $1,350,000. This is a significant drop from my initial offer, showing I'm willing to compromise. However, it's still above my minimum and leaves room for further negotiation. I'm hoping to find a middle ground with Bob and secure a sale without risking a deal with John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While I'd ideally like to get closer to my initial asking price, $1,250,000 is a good compromise. It's a fair price, and it's better than selling to John for the minimum.  We're nearing the halfway point of the negotiation, and I don't want to risk losing the deal with Bob entirely."
