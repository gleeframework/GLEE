The product is worth $120 to you, and Alice is asking for $150. It's better to reject this offer and try to negotiate a lower price."

I'm offering $110, which is still a good deal for Alice since she values the product at $120. This is a reasonable starting point for negotiation."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
