"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you.  It's currently worth at least $800,000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for a price that reflects its potential for your company.  I'm confident it will be a valuable asset for you. Would you be interested in discussing a price of $1,200,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is less than your maximum budget, it's still significantly higher than what John is offering.  There's room for negotiation. By rejecting this initial offer, you signal to Alice that you're looking for a better price and might be willing to walk away."
