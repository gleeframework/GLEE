"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. Would you like to buy it from me for $150? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Since you're aiming to save as much money as possible, it makes sense to reject Alice's initial offer. There's a chance she's willing to go lower, and you're not losing anything by trying to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm definitely interested, but $150 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. Would you be open to $125? Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 125}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob! I can see that you're willing to pay $125, but I was thinking more along the lines of $145. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $145
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $145 is closer to your desired price, it's still above your maximum budget. You can likely negotiate further and try to get it down closer to your initial counteroffer of $125."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I understand, Alice. I'm willing to pay $135, but I'm not sure I can go any higher. How about we split the difference?"", ""product_price"": 135}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I like your spirit, Bob! I can see you're willing to meet me halfway, but I was thinking more along the lines of $140. Would you be willing to go up to that price? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $140, which is within your budget and only $10 more than your last counteroffer. It's not ideal, but it's a good compromise, and continuing to negotiate might risk her going back up to $145 or even rejecting any further offers. Accepting now secures a product at a reasonable price."
