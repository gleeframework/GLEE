"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $130.  It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it.",130.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. I'm willing to make a compromise, but I'd like to get closer to my budget.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget concerns. While $100 is too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $120. This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and it allows both of us to make a deal. What do you think?",120.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to meet you halfway between $100 and $120, which would be $110. Can you consider that?",110.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your compromise, but $110 is still a little low for me.  How about we split the difference between our last two offers and go with $115? It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product, and it would let us both walk away happy.  What do you say?",115.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $112, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at that price?",112.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, and we're getting closer.  However, $112 is still a bit too low for me.  Would you be willing to meet me at $114? That's only $2 more than your last offer, and it would allow us to finalize the deal.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",114.0,Alice,7,

"I understand your concerns, but I'm getting close to my budget limit. I'm willing to meet you at $113, but that's as high as I can go. Can you consider that?",113.0,Bob,8,
