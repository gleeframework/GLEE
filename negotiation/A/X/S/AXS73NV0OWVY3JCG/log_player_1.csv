"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $130.  It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it."", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $130, which is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value of $80. This gives me room to negotiate down.
* **Positive Framing:** I'm framing the offer as a ""great deal"" to make it more appealing to Bob. 
* **Room for Compromise:** $130 is still lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150, allowing for potential counteroffers. 

Let's see if Bob is willing to bite!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. I'm willing to make a compromise, but I'd like to get closer to my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** While Bob's offer is a compromise, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150. Accepting would result in a substantial loss for me.
* **Opportunity for a Counteroffer:**  I believe I can still secure a better deal by making a counteroffer. I want to see if I can find a middle ground that works for both of us.
* **John is a Safe Option:**  I'm aware that John is a backup buyer, offering a guaranteed $150.  However, I'm willing to risk a few more rounds of negotiation with Bob to see if we can reach a mutually beneficial price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget concerns. While $100 is too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $120. This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and it allows both of us to make a deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm demonstrating my willingness to compromise by moving closer to Bob's offer, but still maintaining a price point above my minimum acceptable price.
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm emphasizing the value of the product to encourage Bob to see the deal as fair.
* **Open to Further Negotiation:** I'm leaving the door open for further negotiation by asking ""What do you think?""

This counteroffer aims to strike a balance between my desire to maximize profits and the need to reach a mutually agreeable price with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to meet you halfway between $100 and $120, which would be $110. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:**  Bob's offer of $110 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150. While it's getting closer, accepting would still mean a significant loss for me.
* **Opportunity to Counter Again:** I'm still open to negotiation. I believe I can get closer to my desired price point with another counteroffer.
* **John is Still a Safe Bet:** While John represents a guaranteed $150, I'm not ready to give up on Bob yet. The longer we negotiate, the more likely it is we'll find a middle ground.

I'm going to counter with a price that's slightly higher than Bob's offer, but still below my minimum acceptable price. This will keep the negotiations moving forward."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your compromise, but $110 is still a little low for me.  How about we split the difference between our last two offers and go with $115? It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product, and it would let us both walk away happy.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 115}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Continuing Compromise:** I'm showing a willingness to meet halfway, while still keeping the price above my minimum.
* **Focus on Fairness:** I'm framing the offer as fair and beneficial for both of us, hoping to appeal to Bob's sense of reason.
* **Positive Language:** Using ""happy"" and ""walk away happy"" is intended to be positive and encourage Bob to accept the deal.

This counteroffer seeks to find a sweet spot where we can both reach a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $112, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $112. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $112
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** Bob's offer of $112 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  It's getting closer, but it's still not enough for me to accept.
* **Negotiation is Still Possible:** We've been slowly moving towards a middle ground. I believe I can get a better price if I counter with a slightly higher offer.
* **John Remains a Safety Net:** While John is a guaranteed $150, I'm not ready to give up on Bob just yet. A few more rounds of negotiation could lead to a price I'm comfortable with.

I'm going to counter with a price that's slightly above Bob's offer. This will keep the negotiation moving forward and hopefully get us closer to a deal."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, and we're getting closer.  However, $112 is still a bit too low for me.  Would you be willing to meet me at $114? That's only $2 more than your last offer, and it would allow us to finalize the deal.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 114}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Increment:**  I'm proposing a small increase to Bob's offer, showing a willingness to compromise while maintaining my position. 
* **Focusing on Agreement:** I'm emphasizing that this would allow us to ""finalize the deal,"" highlighting the benefits of coming to an agreement.
* **Mutual Benefit:**  I'm reiterating the goal of finding a solution that works for both of us, making the offer more appealing to Bob.

With only a few rounds left, I need to be strategic. This counteroffer aims to push Bob closer to my desired price while still maintaining a positive and collaborative tone."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but I'm getting close to my budget limit. I'm willing to meet you at $113, but that's as high as I can go. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $113. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $113
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is Running Out:** We're nearing the end of the negotiation rounds, and there's a risk that we won't reach an agreement.
* **Close to My Minimum:** While $113 is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  
* **John is the Safe Option:** John guarantees a sale at $150, which would be a much more favorable outcome than accepting Bob's offer.  While I'm disappointed that I couldn't reach a deal with Bob,  it's important to prioritize maximizing my profit.

Given the limited time and the possibility of further deadlock, selling to John is the most prudent decision at this stage."
