{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**  $500,000 is a great price, but there's room to negotiate further and potentially save more money. It's worth exploring counteroffers before resorting to buying from John."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 350000} 
```

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 375000}

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:** Alice is still above my desired price point, but the negotiations seem to be reaching a stalemate. I'm hoping to push for a lower price one last time before considering buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 400000} 
```

**Reasoning:**  Alice is getting closer to my ideal price. This counteroffer shows I'm willing to meet her halfway, but I'm not going to go much higher. If she rejects this, I'll probably need to seriously consider buying from John."

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $450,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**  Alice is now asking for more than my initial offer. While I'm not entirely happy with the price from John, I've exhausted my negotiation options with Alice. With only a few rounds left, the risk of getting stuck with a higher price from Alice is too high. I need to secure the product now, and John's offer is still significantly cheaper than my maximum budget."
