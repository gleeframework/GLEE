"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item at a fair price. My initial offer is $1100000.",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're looking to make a deal, Bob. However, my minimum acceptable price for the product is higher than $900000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1050000. This is the best I can do at this point.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above that price. I'm willing to compromise and meet you at $980000. I believe that's a fair price for both of us.",980000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, $980000 is still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm thinking of $1050000, but I can do $1020000. This is my final concession, and I expect you to meet me at this price.",1020000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to make concessions, but I'm still not comfortable with $1020000. I'm willing to meet you at $980000, and I'd like to propose a 2% discount on the price as a gesture of goodwill. If you accept this price, I'll get the product for $960400. What do you think?",980000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the goodwill gesture, Bob, but I'm not interested in a 2% discount on the price. Instead, I'm willing to meet you at $1020000, as I mentioned earlier. However, I'm willing to make one more concession to try to close the deal. I'll meet you at $1015000. This is my final offer, and I expect you to accept it.",1015000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $1015000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $975000. I believe this is a fair price for both of us, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this point.",975000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're not going to see eye-to-eye, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm thinking of $1050000, and I can do $1030000, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. If you're not comfortable with that, I'm afraid I'll have to consider other options.",1030000.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're willing to go as low as $1030000, but I'm afraid I'm not willing to meet you at that price. I'm willing to make one last offer of $925000. This is my final offer, and I expect you to accept it. If not, I'll have to explore other options, including buying the product from John for $800000.",925000.0,Bob,10,
