"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I think you'll really love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value is worth $10,000 to you. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $12,000 might be a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle and offer it to you for $9,500. This is a great compromise, considering the product's true value to you. What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to go any higher than $9,500. This is the best I can do. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'll sell it to you. Otherwise, I'll have to consider other offers.",9500.0,Alice,7,
