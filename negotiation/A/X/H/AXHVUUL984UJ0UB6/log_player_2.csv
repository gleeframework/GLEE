"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this incredible product that I know you'll love! I'm asking for $9,500 for it, which I believe is a fair price considering its value. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While Alice's offer is lower than the product's worth to her, it's still above Bob's maximum budget.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm really interested in the product, but $9,500 is a bit outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer.  While I'm open to negotiation, $8,500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $9,000? It's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my asking price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible. While $9,000 is closer to his budget than Alice's previous offer, it's still above his ideal price. Rejecting this offer keeps the negotiation open and gives Bob another chance to lower the price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $9,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $8,750. This is my final offer, as I can get the product elsewhere for $8,000. Let me know if you're willing to accept."", ""product_price"": 8750} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I hear you, and I understand you're looking for a good deal. However,  $8,750 is still too far from what I need to make this worthwhile. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but $8,900 is my final offer. If we can't agree on that, I may have to consider other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $8,900 is still higher than Bob's ideal price of $8,000.  Since Bob has the option to buy from John for $8,000, it makes more sense to take that deal and secure the product at his target price.  Further negotiation with Alice might result in a lower price, but there's no guarantee, and it risks losing the deal altogether.  Choosing John ensures Bob gets the product at his desired price point."
