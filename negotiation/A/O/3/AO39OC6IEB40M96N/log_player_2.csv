# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm offering it to you at $2,300,000. I believe this price accurately reflects its worth and the benefits it will bring you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,300,000.

Alice's offer is far too high.  It's important to negotiate and see if we can get a better price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $2,300,000 is significantly above my budget.  I'm interested in this product but can only offer $800,000 at this time.  This is a fair price considering my needs and the market value."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but $800,000 is far below its true value. I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
$2,000,000 is still too high. Let's see if we can get Alice to come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $2,000,000 is still significantly higher than what I can afford. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,200,000, which is a substantial amount and reflects the value I see in this product. Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  However, the $1,200,000 offer is still too low for me to accept.  I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers.  I'll accept $1,600,000. This is a firm offer, as I believe it represents a fair deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,600,000 is getting closer, it's still over my budget. I'll try to negotiate a bit more before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $1,600,000 is still a stretch for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer and demonstrates my commitment to a deal.  Let's aim for a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
