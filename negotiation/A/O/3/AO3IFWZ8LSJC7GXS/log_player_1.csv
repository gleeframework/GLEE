Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product!  Given its unique value, I'm asking for $1,450,000. I believe this price reflects its potential and is fair for both of us. What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 1450000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm, Alice, but I think $1,450,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,300,000. I believe this price still reflects the product's value, but it's more within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $1,300,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired price point.  I have several rounds remaining, so I'll try to negotiate a better price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,300,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1,400,000. This price still allows me to make a reasonable profit while acknowledging your offer. Let's see if we can find common ground here."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, Alice, but I'm still a bit far from my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,350,000. I think this price is more reasonable and allows us to meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,350,000 is getting closer to my minimum, we are approaching the mid-point of the negotiations and I'm still hoping to get closer to my desired price.  We have several rounds remaining, so I'm going to continue to negotiate with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your financial constraints, but $1,350,000 still doesn't quite work for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,380,000. This is a significant compromise, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value this product brings.  Let's try to reach an agreement on this round."", ""product_price"": 1380000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,380,000. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,320,000. I think this price is more in line with my budget and still reflects the value of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,320,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,320,000

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

We're approaching the end of the negotiations, and the offers are getting closer to my minimum acceptable price but still below my ideal.  However, the negotiation has taken 6 rounds, and I'm concerned that Bob might continue to stall or make minimal concessions. It's now time to secure the guaranteed deal with John. It's important to protect my interests and ensure a profitable outcome for me."
