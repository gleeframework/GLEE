"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider my counteroffer?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm afraid $10000 is a bit below my minimum. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my target price. How about we meet at $12500?",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand that you're trying to get closer to your target price, but $12500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I can only go up to $11000. Can you consider my counteroffer?",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway again. However, $11000 is still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get closer to my minimum. How about we meet at $13000?",13000.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to make one more compromise. However, I've already made a significant concession by offering you the product at $13500. I'm not willing to go any lower than $14000. This is my final offer. If you're interested, I'm willing to sell the product to you at this price. If not, I'll have to consider other options.",14000.0,Alice,9,
