"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  $1,400,000 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000.  That's a significant discount from my initial offer, and it's still a fair price considering the value of the product to you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
