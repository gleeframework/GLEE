"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, I'm still firm on a price closer to my initial offer.  Let's split the difference. How about $1,125,000? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find the product to be worth it.",1125000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my budget with your latest offer. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $1,090,000?",1090000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm willing to come down a bit further, but $1,090,000 is still a bit low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,105,000? This gives us both a fair deal, and we can finalize this transaction. What do you think?",1105000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still trying to get as close to my budget as possible. How about we meet at $1,080,000? I'm willing to make a bit of a compromise, but I need to be mindful of my financial constraints.",1080000.0,Bob,6,
