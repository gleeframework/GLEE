"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer of $140. I understand that it's a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you the product for $160. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy it.",160.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're sticking to your offer of $140, but I'm still not comfortable selling at that price. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer you the product for $155. It's the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal.",155.0,Alice,5,
