"I have a unique opportunity to sell this product to you today. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really appreciate it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $18,000.",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit steep for me. This product would be valuable to me, but I have a budget in mind.  Would you consider $12,000?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you have a budget in mind, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $12,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering $14,000. This is a fair price, considering the value the product will bring to you.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, $14,000 is still a bit more than I'm looking to spend. How about $12,500? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",12500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob, but I'm not comfortable going below $14,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'm counteroffering $13,500. This is as low as I'm willing to go.",13500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm getting closer to my limit, but I still can't quite meet your price. Would you consider $12,750? This is a serious offer, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.",12750.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to make a serious offer, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go below $14,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'm counteroffering $13,800. This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to negotiate further.",13800.0,Alice,7,
