**Reasoning:** 

Bob has consistently been unwilling to meet at a price point that reflects the value of the product to me.  His latest offer of $1,700,000 is too far below my minimum. It's unlikely he'll significantly increase his offer in the remaining rounds.  It's time to cut my losses and secure the guaranteed $1,500,000 from John."
