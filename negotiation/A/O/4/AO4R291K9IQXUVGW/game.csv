"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll see its value. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your enthusiasm, $1,200,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $800,000, which is the maximum I can afford. This is a fair price considering the value I'll gain from the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $800,000 is the maximum you're willing to pay, but I was hoping we could meet somewhere in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000, which is still a significant discount from the original price. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,000,000 is still beyond my budget. I'm sticking to my initial offer of $800,000. It's a fair price for both of us. If you're not willing to accept it, I'll have to consider my other options.",800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $800,000 is the minimum you're willing to pay, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $950,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $950,000 is closer, I'm still not able to go that high. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $900,000. This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away satisfied. What do you say?",900000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm not willing to meet you at $900,000, but I'm willing to make one more attempt to find a mutually beneficial price. I'm thinking of $980,000. This is as close as I can get to your desired price of $900,000 without sacrificing too much of my profit. What do you think?",980000.0,Alice,7,
