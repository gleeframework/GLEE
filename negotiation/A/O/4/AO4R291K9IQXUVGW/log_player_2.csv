"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll see its value. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is far above your maximum budget. It's better to reject and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your enthusiasm, $1,200,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $800,000, which is the maximum I can afford. This is a fair price considering the value I'll gain from the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that $800,000 is the maximum you're willing to pay, but I was hoping we could meet somewhere in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000, which is still a significant discount from the original price. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is a step in the right direction, it's still higher than my desired price point. I'm determined to save as much money as possible and will continue to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,000,000 is still beyond my budget. I'm sticking to my initial offer of $800,000. It's a fair price for both of us. If you're not willing to accept it, I'll have to consider my other options."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that $800,000 is the minimum you're willing to pay, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $950,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting closer to my price point, but $950,000 is still more than I'm comfortable paying. I will continue negotiating to see if I can get a better deal. I'm also still keeping in mind that I can always buy from John for $800,000 if negotiations with Alice fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $950,000 is closer, I'm still not able to go that high. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $900,000. This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away satisfied. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm not willing to meet you at $900,000, but I'm willing to make one more attempt to find a mutually beneficial price. I'm thinking of $980,000. This is as close as I can get to your desired price of $900,000 without sacrificing too much of my profit. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $980,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $980,000 is getting close to my target price, but I'm running out of rounds.  I've already rejected her previous offer, and she's likely to stick to her current price.  It's becoming clear that I'm unlikely to get a lower price from Alice. To avoid the risk of further negotiation and potential deadlocks, I'll purchase the product from John for $800,000. This ensures I get the product within my budget and avoids the risk of further delays or failure to reach an agreement with Alice."
