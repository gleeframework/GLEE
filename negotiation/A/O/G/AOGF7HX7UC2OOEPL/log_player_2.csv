{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

This is too high of a price for Bob. He should reject the offer and see if he can get Alice to lower her price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}

Bob starts with a bold counteroffer, significantly lower than Alice's initial price. This will test Alice's willingness to negotiate and hopefully start the conversation on a price closer to Bob's limit."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's lower than her initial offer, it's still above Bob's limit.  He has more rounds to negotiate and can try to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Bob should reject Alice's offer. It is still above his limit of $15,000, and with only 5 rounds left, he should keep trying to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

Bob should now make his final offer at his limit of $15,000. It's time to see if Alice is willing to meet him at this price, or if she'll continue to try and get a higher price.  If she rejects this offer, Bob should be prepared to go to John for the guaranteed price."
