"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be interested in. I'm asking for $100 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm aiming for a price close to the middle ground between my minimum ($80) and Bob's perceived value ($120). 
* **Positive opening:** I want to start the negotiation on a friendly note and highlight the potential value for Bob.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  A $100 offer gives me some space to negotiate down if necessary, without feeling like I'm giving away too much."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer but $100 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $90. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value vs. Risk:**  Bob's offer is only $10 less than my initial offer, but it's still a decent profit for me.  
* **Time is money:**  Continuing to negotiate risks dragging out the process and potentially losing Bob as a buyer.
* **John's offer:**  While John's offer of $80 is guaranteed, it's significantly lower than Bob's offer.  

By accepting Bob's offer, I secure a good price and avoid the uncertainty of further negotiation."
