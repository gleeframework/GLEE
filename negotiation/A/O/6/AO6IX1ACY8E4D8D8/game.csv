"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase my product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,100,000 is fair. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the price of $1,100,000. Would you consider lowering the price closer to my maximum budget of $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $800,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to negotiate, how about we meet halfway at $950,000?",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Alice. While I understand the value of the product, I still feel that $950,000 is beyond my current budget. I would like to propose a price of $900,000 to see if we can reach an agreement.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $900,000 is still quite a bit below my bottom line.  I could consider $925,000, but that's my final offer.",925000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your latest offer, Alice. I've considered your proposal carefully, and while I respect your position, I must respectfully decline. I am still committed to staying within my budget of $800,000. I hope this aligns better with your considerations.",800000.0,Bob,6,
