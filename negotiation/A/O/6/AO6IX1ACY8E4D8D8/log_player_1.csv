Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the price of $1,100,000. Would you consider lowering the price closer to my maximum budget of $800,000?

Bob is clearly not budging from his $800,000 offer.  It's time to cut my losses and move on to John who is offering a price that reflects the product's true value."
