"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $9,500 is a good price, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $8,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice, but $9,500 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $8,500.  Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit to $9,000, but that's my final offer.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to get the product for as low as possible. While $9,000 is closer to Bob's budget than Alice's initial offer, it's still above his maximum. Rejecting the offer gives Bob another chance to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $9,000 is still out of my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $8,750, which is a fair compromise.  Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 8750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $8,750 is still a bit too low for me. Let's meet in the middle.  I'm willing to go down to $8,900.  This is my final offer.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $8,900 is closer to Bob's budget and a good compromise, it's still above the maximum Bob wants to pay.  Rejecting the offer gives Bob another opportunity to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm really trying to make this work, but $8,900 is still a bit too much for me.  I'm willing to go up to $8,800, which is a fair compromise and right at my limit.  Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 8800}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but I'm also trying to get a fair price for my product.  How about we split the difference?  I'll go down to $8,850.  This is my final offer.  If you accept, we can close the deal.  If not, I'll have to consider selling to someone else. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,850. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,850
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $8,850 is a great deal and much lower than Alice's initial offer, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $8,000. At this point, it's more beneficial for Bob to buy the product from John for a guaranteed $8,000, as there's no guarantee Alice will accept a lower offer and it's not worth risking going over his budget."
