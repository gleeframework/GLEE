"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer Alice, but $9,500 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $8,500.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit to $9,000, but that's my final offer.  Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $9,000 is still out of my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $8,750, which is a fair compromise.  Let's make this deal happen.",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $8,750 is still a bit too low for me. Let's meet in the middle.  I'm willing to go down to $8,900.  This is my final offer.  What do you say?",8900.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm really trying to make this work, but $8,900 is still a bit too much for me.  I'm willing to go up to $8,800, which is a fair compromise and right at my limit.  Let's close this deal.",8800.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but I'm also trying to get a fair price for my product.  How about we split the difference?  I'll go down to $8,850.  This is my final offer.  If you accept, we can close the deal.  If not, I'll have to consider selling to someone else.",8850.0,Alice,7,
