"Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to acquire a valuable product for a price well below its true worth. While I value it at $1,500,000, I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000. This represents a significant savings for you, and I'm confident you'll find this offer appealing.  Consider this a chance to secure a valuable asset at a competitive price.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
