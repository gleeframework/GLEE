Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $925,000. This is a fantastic deal considering what you stand to gain."", 
""product_price"": 925000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,000,000.
* **Your Minimum:** You need at least $800,000. 
* **Maximizing Profit:**  Offering a price slightly below Bob's valuation ($925,000) significantly increases the chances of him accepting while still securing a substantial profit for you.

This strategy aims to find a sweet spot that's appealing to Bob but also highly profitable for you."
