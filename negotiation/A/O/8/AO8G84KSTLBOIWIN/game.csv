"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to offer you $9,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500.  This is a fair compromise, considering your initial offer.  What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $10,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $9,500. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.  What do you think?",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9,500 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,000, which is a significant compromise on my part. Let's close this deal and find a mutually beneficial agreement.  What do you say?",10000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting closer.  I'm willing to go up to $9,750.  Let's make this deal happen.  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",9750.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand we're getting close, but $9,750 still doesn't quite work for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10,250.  This is my final offer, and it's a fair compromise considering our previous discussions.  Let's close this deal and move forward.",10250.0,Alice,7,
