"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I really like the product, but I have to be mindful of my budget.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget concerns, but $12,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,000? I'm confident you'll find it's a fair price for the value you'll get.",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the effort to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit hesitant at $13,000. Would you be willing to consider $11,500? I'm really interested in the product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget.",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $11,500 is a bit too low for me to accept, but I'm willing to come down to $12,500. This is my final offer, and I think it's a fair compromise that recognizes the product's value.",12500.0,Alice,5,
