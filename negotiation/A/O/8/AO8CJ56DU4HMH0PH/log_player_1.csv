Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for sale at a special price of $200. I think it's a great deal for the value it provides. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 200}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate your willingness to sell the product. However, I believe I can find a better deal elsewhere. I am willing to pay $150 for the product. Please let me know if this is acceptable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

Bob's offer is his highest valuation of the product.  Since I can sell to John for $150, which is equal to Bob's offer and my minimum acceptable price, it makes the most sense to sell to John and avoid further negotiation."
