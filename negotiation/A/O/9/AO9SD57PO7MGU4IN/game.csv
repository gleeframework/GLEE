"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this unique product. It's worth a great deal to both of us, and I believe we can strike a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm starting with a price of $1,200,000, reflecting its value and the potential it holds for your business. I'm open to discussing your thoughts and finding a price that works for both of us.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I think the product is worth less to me than you're asking. I'm willing to pay $800,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the market demand. I'm open to further negotiations, but I need to stay within my budget. What do you think?",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $800,000 is below my initial asking price, it's still considerably less than the product's true value. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to lower my price to $1,050,000. This price reflects a significant discount while still allowing me to receive a fair return on my investment. I'm confident that this is a price that works for both of us, and I'm open to further discussions if needed.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice, but I still think the product is worth less to me than you're asking. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it, but I need to stay within my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our current prices, so I'm offering $950,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and the market demand. What do you think?",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest and willingness to negotiate. While $950,000 is closer to what I'm seeking, it's still not quite there yet. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $975,000. This price reflects a compromise and takes into consideration your budget while still allowing me a reasonable return. Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",975000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our current prices again, so I'm offering $962,500. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and the market demand. I'm willing to go up to this price, but I need to stay within my budget. What do you think?",962500.0,Bob,6,
