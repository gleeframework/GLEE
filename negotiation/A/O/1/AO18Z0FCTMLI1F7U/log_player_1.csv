Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product, and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm asking for $100, but I'm open to discussing a fair price."", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price of $100, which is higher than my minimum value of $80. This gives me room to negotiate and potentially get a better price. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm signaling to Bob that I'm willing to negotiate, which makes him more likely to engage in a conversation.
* **Positive Framing:** I'm highlighting the product's value and suggesting that Bob would benefit from owning it.

This strategy aims to start the negotiation in a strong position while leaving room for flexibility. I'm willing to lower my price if necessary, but I'm also prepared to walk away if Bob doesn't meet my expectations."
