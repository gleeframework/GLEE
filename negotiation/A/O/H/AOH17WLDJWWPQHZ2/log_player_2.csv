Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that will meet your needs. I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,000. Is this something you'd like to consider? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:

Round 2

{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $9,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $7,500 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 7500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $8,500. I've already compromised a lot, and I need to make a profit. I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal, but the price remains at $8,500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob has reached his limit. Alice is unwilling to go lower than $8,500, and Bob is only willing to pay $8,000.  Rather than continuing to negotiate and potentially wasting more time, Bob decides to buy the product from John for $8,000.  This ensures that Bob gets the product at his desired price without further negotiation."
