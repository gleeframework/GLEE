"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,600,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 1600000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm beginning the negotiation significantly above both my minimum price and Bob's perceived value. This allows room for negotiation and creates the perception that the product is highly valued.
* **Gauge Bob's Interest:**  The message is designed to be open-ended, inviting Bob to respond and reveal his level of interest and price sensitivity. 
* **Alternative Option:**  I'm keeping in mind that I have a guaranteed offer from John, giving me leverage in the negotiation with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but given my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price closer to my maximum willingness to pay. My counteroffer is $900,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Room for Negotiation:** Bob's counteroffer is closer to his perceived value, indicating potential for a deal. 
* **Unacceptable Offer:**  $900,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.
* **Leveraging John's Offer:**  I will use John's offer as leverage to push for a higher price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $900,000 is significantly below its true market value. I've had substantial interest in this product, and to be completely transparent, I have another offer closer to my asking price. However, I value this negotiation and believe we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. Would you be willing to consider $1,400,000?"",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong but Flexible:** I'm holding firm on a price well above Bob's offer but below my initial ask. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but not desperate.
* **Leveraging Competition:**  Mentioning the other offer (John) without revealing the specific price creates urgency and emphasizes the product's value. 
* **Seeking Compromise:** I'm still aiming for a price that's beneficial for me while acknowledging Bob's constraints and inviting him to meet me closer to the middle ground."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. Thank you for providing more details about the situation. Considering the value of the product and the current market conditions, I am willing to increase my offer to $1,100,000. I hope this proposal is within the range that could lead to a successful negotiation. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acceptable Offer:**  Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is above my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. 
* **Strong Negotiation Position Unlikely:** While I could potentially push for a slightly higher price, the difference is not significant enough to risk losing the deal entirely. Bob has shown a willingness to negotiate, but his offer is already above his initial perceived value.
* **Time Value:**  Prolonging the negotiation further might not yield a significantly better outcome, and I risk losing Bob altogether. Accepting now secures a good profit."
