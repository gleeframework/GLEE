"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential worth to you, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,400,000.  I'm open to discussing this further, so please let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is higher than the product's worth to her, but still within your budget. However, there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting her offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a better price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you countering.  While that price is tempting, I believe the product's true value justifies a higher price point. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,375,000. This offer represents a fair compromise, don't you think?

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down from her initial price, which is a good sign, but her new offer is still above your ideal price point. Rejecting her offer allows you to make another counteroffer, potentially securing a price closer to your target."
