Round 2
Bob's offer:

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $7,500 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $8,000. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob and see if we can find a price that works for both of us."
