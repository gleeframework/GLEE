{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

$400,000 is a good starting point, but you can likely get a better deal. Rejecting the offer allows you to counter and potentially save more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer to see if Alice is willing to negotiate. A $100,000 reduction from her initial offer is a good starting point for bargaining."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is coming down in price, but it's still not at a point where I'm ready to accept. I'll counter again to try and get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 325000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer slightly to $325,000. This shows Alice I'm serious about buying the product but I'm still aiming for a lower price. This is a good middle ground to see if she's willing to meet halfway."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $337,500

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting closer to my target price. It's still a good deal compared to buying from John.  Accepting at this point is likely the best option to secure the product at a fair price."
