Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $15,000. It's a fantastic deal, and I believe it will be highly valuable to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 15000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$15,000:** This is a starting point that is significantly higher than my minimum value ($10,000) but hopefully not too unreasonable for Bob to consider.
* **Message:** I am trying to be friendly and encouraging, while also highlighting the potential value of the product to Bob. 

This strategy allows me to:

* **Test the waters:** I'm gauging Bob's interest and willingness to pay a premium for the product. 
* **Leave room for negotiation:** If Bob rejects this offer, I can lower the price a bit in subsequent counteroffers. 
* **Maintain leverage:** By mentioning John's offer, I subtly indicate that I have other options and am not desperate for a sale."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $9000 for it. Can we meet in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is significantly lower than my initial offer, it's still higher than my minimum acceptable price. However, I want to see if I can get closer to my initial asking price.  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to counter-offer and potentially secure a better deal.  

I'll aim for a price closer to my initial $15,000, but  I'll need to be realistic given Bob's stated budget constraints."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints.  While $9,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $12,000. This reflects the value of the product and gives us both a good deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm proposing $12,000, which is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer. This shows flexibility while still aiming for a price closer to my target.
* **Message:** I'm acknowledging Bob's budget constraints but also emphasizing the value of the product. I'm trying to find a middle ground that feels fair to both of us. 

This strategy aims to:

* **Maintain leverage:**  I'm not accepting Bob's low offer immediately, showing that I'm not desperate to sell. 
* **Explore potential agreement:**  I'm hoping that $12,000 is a price Bob is willing to consider, given his stated interest in the product. 
* **Position myself well:**  If Bob rejects this offer, I can either lower my price slightly or move on to John, knowing I've already made a reasonable attempt to negotiate with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $12000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $10000 for the product. I'm hoping we can meet at a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $10,000 is my minimum acceptable price, and it's the same price I can get from John.  Since I'm not sure if I can get a better price from Bob, it's in my best interest to accept his offer. This ensures a quick sale and a guaranteed profit."
