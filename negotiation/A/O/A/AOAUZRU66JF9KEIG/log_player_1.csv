"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a unique product that I think you'd be interested in. I'm offering it to you for $10,000. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($8,000) to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Friendly tone:** I'm keeping the message positive and inviting to build rapport.
* **Highlighting value:** I mention that the product is ""unique"" to pique Bob's interest and potentially increase his perceived value. 
* **Leaving the door open:** I ask for Bob's thoughts, giving him a chance to counter without feeling pressured. 

This strategy allows me to gauge Bob's interest while maximizing my potential profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $9000. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* Bob's counteroffer is closer to my minimum, but I'm not desperate. I'm still confident I can get a better price. 
* I'm going to counter again to try and squeeze out a bit more profit. 
* I want to see if Bob is genuinely interested or just trying to get a bargain."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $9,000 is still below my desired price point. How about we meet in the middle at $9,500? Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-counter:** I'm acknowledging Bob's offer but standing my ground. I'm not giving in entirely.
* **Compromise:** I propose a middle ground, suggesting a price that's closer to my desired price while still being slightly lower than my initial offer.
* **Maintaining the momentum:** I'm keeping the conversation positive and open-ended, encouraging Bob to continue negotiating.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between staying firm on my desired profit and demonstrating flexibility to keep Bob engaged in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'd like to try to find a compromise. How about we meet at $9200? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Close to target:** Bob's offer is only $200 below my desired $9,400. This is a good compromise.
* **Risk of losing momentum:** Continuing to counter risks losing Bob's interest and potentially ending up with the lower price of John's offer.
* **Time is a factor:** We are already in round 4, and the negotiation clock is ticking.

At this point, it's more beneficial to secure the sale at a price that is close to my desired value rather than risk losing Bob and ending up with John's lower offer."
