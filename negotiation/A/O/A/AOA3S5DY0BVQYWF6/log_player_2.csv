"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this great product at a special price of $14,000. It's a fantastic deal, and I think you'll love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer of $14,000 is better than John's price of $15,000, there's still room for negotiation.  Bob should reject the offer and try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate the enthusiasm, but $14,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  I'd be interested in buying it for $12,500. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $13,750. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll find it's worth every penny. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $13,750 is better than John's price of $15,000, Bob is still trying to get the best possible price. He can likely negotiate lower. Bob should reject the offer and try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $13,750 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm happy to pay $13,000 for the product.  This would be a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident it's a fair price."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not willing to go as low as $13,000, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $13,500. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is good:**  At $13,500, Alice's offer is better than John's price of $15,000. 
* **Limited negotiating room:**  Alice has indicated she's not willing to go lower, and there's a chance she might reject another counteroffer. 
* **Risk of losing out:** Bob has only 5 rounds left.  If he keeps rejecting, he risks losing the opportunity to buy from Alice and being forced to buy from John at a higher price.

While Bob might like to push for a lower price, it's likely more beneficial to accept this offer and secure the product for a good price, rather than risk a deal falling through."
