"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate the enthusiasm, but $14,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  I'd be interested in buying it for $12,500. What do you think?",12500.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $13,750 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm happy to pay $13,000 for the product.  This would be a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident it's a fair price.",13000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm not willing to go as low as $13,000, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $13,500. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for you.",13500.0,Alice,5,
