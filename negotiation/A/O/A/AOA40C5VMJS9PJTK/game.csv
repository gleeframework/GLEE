"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the purchase of this amazing product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value is worth $10000 to you. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer but $12000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. Would you consider $9500?  I believe this is a fair price that benefits both of us. ",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9500. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $11000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the benefits it will bring to you. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11000 is still outside my budget.  How about $10500?  This is a fair price that allows us both to benefit from this transaction.  Let's aim for a mutually beneficial outcome.",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $10500 is still a bit above your target, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm counteroffering at $11200. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value and my initial offer. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm open to a deal. What do you think?",11200.0,Alice,5,
