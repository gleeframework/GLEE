"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the purchase of this amazing product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value is worth $10000 to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is higher than your maximum budget of $10,000. It's not a good deal for you. You should reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer but $12,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. Would you consider $9,500?  I believe this is a fair price that benefits both of us. "", ""product_price"": 9500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9500. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $11000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the benefits it will bring to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's counteroffer is lower than her initial price, it's still above your budget. It's better to try and negotiate a lower price again.  You can still get the product for $10,000 from John, so there's no rush to accept Alice's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11,000 is still outside my budget.  How about $10,500?  This is a fair price that allows us both to benefit from this transaction.  Let's aim for a mutually beneficial outcome."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $10500 is still a bit above your target, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm counteroffering at $11200. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value and my initial offer. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm open to a deal. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's final counteroffer of $11,200 is still above your budget. It's better to go with the guaranteed price of $10,000 from John.  While there's a chance Alice might come down further, you've already had several rounds of negotiation and there's no guarantee she will reach your desired price."
