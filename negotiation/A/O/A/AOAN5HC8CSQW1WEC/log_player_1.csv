{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is moving slowly, and we're still significantly above his perceived value. While there's a chance he might go higher, the difference between his offer and John's guaranteed offer is getting smaller with each round.  We need to push Bob closer to our acceptable range."

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you've made a final offer, but I'm still a bit far from my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to be at $900,000 or lower. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial deal.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**  Bob is holding firm, and it's unlikely he'll go significantly higher than $900,000. We've reached a point where the potential gains from continuing to negotiate with Bob are outweighed by the certainty of John's offer. Selling to John ensures we get our minimum acceptable price."
