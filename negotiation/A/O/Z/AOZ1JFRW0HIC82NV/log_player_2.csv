Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 significantly undervalues this product and its potential.  I could consider a price of $1,900,000. This is a more realistic reflection of its worth.

Alice's offer:

**Reasoning:** While Alice is coming down on her price, she's still significantly above your maximum budget and John's offer. It's unlikely she'll move closer to $1,000,000, especially since she stated her last offer was final. Cutting your losses now and going with John guarantees you get the product within your budget."
