"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer but that's far too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $800,000 for this product.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 significantly undervalues this product and its potential.  I could consider a price of $1,900,000. This is a more realistic reflection of its worth.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, we are still very far apart on price.  To be frank, I am exploring other options. I could go up to $900,000 if you are willing to negotiate further.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but the value of this product is substantial. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000.  This is my final offer, as I believe it's a fair compromise.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
