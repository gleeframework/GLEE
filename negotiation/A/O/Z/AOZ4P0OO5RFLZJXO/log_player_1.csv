Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm offering it at $12,000."", 
""product_price"": 12000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Start High:**  Alice knows Bob values the product at $8,000 and she wants to maximize her profit. Starting with a price higher than Bob's valuation leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Leave Room to Negotiate:** The $12,000 offer is a strong opening, but it allows Alice to potentially come down in price if Bob negotiates well, while still staying above her minimum acceptable price.
* **Alternative Buyer:** Knowing John will buy the product for $10,000 gives Alice a strong fallback position. She doesn't need to settle for less than that."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $12,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $9,000 is still below Alice's minimum acceptable price of $10,000. While closer to her target, Alice knows she has a guaranteed offer from John. She will try to negotiate a better deal with Bob before resorting to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for your offer, Bob.  I understand your perspective on the price.  While I value this product at a higher price point, I'm willing to come down to $11,000 for a quick sale.  This is a significant discount and I believe it's a fair offer considering the value you'll gain."", 
""product_price"": 11000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** Alice needs to show she's willing to negotiate, but not too much. Reducing her offer by $1,000 is significant enough to encourage Bob while still staying above her minimum.
* **Justifying the Price:** By highlighting the value Bob will gain and framing the price as a ""quick sale"" discount, Alice adds weight to her counteroffer.
* **Maintaining Leverage:** Alice still holds the stronger position knowing John is waiting. This allows her to be firm without seeming unreasonable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is incrementally increasing his offers, but it's clear he's unlikely to reach Alice's $10,000 minimum.  Continuing to negotiate might yield a slightly higher offer from Bob, but it's risky. John represents a guaranteed $10,000, making it the safer and more profitable choice at this point."
