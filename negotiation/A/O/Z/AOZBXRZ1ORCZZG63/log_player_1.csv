Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's valued at $1,000,000 and I believe it would be a game-changer for your business. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,200,000.  Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900000 for the product. I believe it's a great opportunity, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is a significant amount, it's still below the minimum I'm willing to accept. I have 10 rounds to negotiate, and there's a chance I can get closer to my target price. I also have the safety net of selling to John for $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget concerns. While I appreciate your offer, $900,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.  This is a substantial discount from my initial offer, and still reflects the significant value this product offers.  I'm confident we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $1050000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $975000. Can you consider this revised offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $975,000 is getting closer, it's still below my minimum threshold.  I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob, as he's shown he's interested in the product. There are still 6 rounds remaining, and I believe I can potentially reach a more favorable agreement."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, and I'm willing to continue negotiating. While $975,000 is still a bit lower than I'd like, I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000.
