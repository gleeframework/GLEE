"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900000 for the product. I believe it's a great opportunity, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget. Can you consider my offer?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget concerns. While I appreciate your offer, $900000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1050000.  This is a substantial discount from my initial offer, and still reflects the significant value this product offers.  I'm confident we can find common ground.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $1050000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $975000. Can you consider this revised offer?",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, and I'm willing to continue negotiating. While $975000 is still a bit lower than I'd like, I'm willing to come down to $1000000.  This is a significant compromise, and reflects the true value of this product for your business. Let's make this deal happen.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
