Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,200,000 from John, making this your ""walk-away"" point.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,500,000.
* **The Zone of Possible Agreement (ZOPA):** Exists between $1,200,000 (your minimum) and $1,500,000 (Bob's maximum). Any price within this range can lead to a deal.

**Strategy**

You want to secure the highest price within the ZOPA. Starting high gives you room to negotiate down if needed.

**Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm proposing a price of $1,450,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and potential for your business."",
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **High Starting Point:**  $1,450,000 leaves room for negotiation while aiming closer to Bob's maximum valuation.
* **Confident Tone:** The message positions the product as highly valuable.
* **No Justification:** Avoid giving reasons for the price, as it opens you up to counter-arguments.

**Important Considerations**

* **Bob's Response:** Be prepared to negotiate if Bob counters. You have leverage knowing John's offer exists.
* **Relationship:**  If a long-term relationship with Bob is important, you might be slightly more flexible.

**Remember:** This is just one possible offer. The optimal price will depend on your negotiation style and risk tolerance."
