{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save money. Alice's offer is above Bob's maximum budget.  It's better to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price.  While buying from John is a guaranteed option, there's a chance Bob can get a better deal by continuing to negotiate with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob is offering a price that is $1,000 below his maximum budget. This is a significant discount from Alice's initial offer, but still leaves room for Alice to make a profit. This counteroffer shows that Bob is serious about buying the product but is also willing to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is still higher than Bob's maximum budget of $12,000. Even though it's lower than the initial offer, it's still not a good deal for Bob. Since Bob can buy the product from John for $12,000, it's better to continue negotiating with Alice. There's still a chance that Bob can get a better price, or at least a price closer to his maximum budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Explanation:**

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is still above Bob's maximum budget of $12,000. While it's closer to what Bob is willing to pay, there's no reason to accept it yet. Bob has already shown a willingness to negotiate and is getting closer to his desired price. Rejecting the offer and making another counteroffer can potentially lead to a better deal, or at least a price closer to his budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is increasing his offer again, getting closer to Alice's price but staying within his budget. This counteroffer demonstrates a willingness to compromise while still aiming to achieve a better price. The offer is also closer to the price John is offering, making it a more enticing option for Alice to consider."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is still $1,000 above Bob's maximum budget.  While continuing to negotiate might lead to a better deal, there's no guarantee. Given that John offers the product for Bob's maximum budget, it's a safer and more certain option. Bob can buy from John and avoid further negotiations. This choice ensures that Bob gets the product for the price he is willing to pay."
