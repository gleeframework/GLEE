"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a great opportunity for us to work together. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,000.",9000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm interested, but $9,000 is a bit higher than I'd like to go.  Would you consider $8,500?  That's a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to make this deal happen.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit above your target. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $9,200. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's a fair compromise.",9200.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9,200 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to pay $8,800, which is a fair price for both of us.  I'm confident we can close this deal.",8800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your desire to split the difference, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable going below $9,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and sell the product to you for $9,100. This is as low as I can go, but I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product.",9100.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $9,100 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,900, which is a fair price for both of us. It's only $200 away from your offer, and it allows us to close this deal. Let's make it happen.",8900.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that $8,900 is a tempting offer, Bob, but I'm still not willing to give up too much profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and sell the product to you for $9,050. This is the last concession I'm willing to make, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",9050.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're looking for a good price, but $9,050 is still a bit too much for me. I'm willing to pay $8,950, which is a compromise for both of us. It's only $100 away from your offer, and I'm confident we can close this deal. What do you say?",8950.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $8,950 is still a bit above your target, but I'm not willing to go any lower. I'm willing to give you a final concession and sell the product to you for $9,000. This is the absolute lowest price I can accept, and I hope we can finally come to an agreement.",9000.0,Alice,9,
