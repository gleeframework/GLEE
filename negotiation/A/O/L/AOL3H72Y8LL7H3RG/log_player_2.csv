"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a great opportunity for us to work together. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Alice's offer of $9,000 is still above Bob's ideal price of $8,000. There's room for negotiation, so rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer is the best strategy for now."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm interested, but $9,000 is a bit higher than I'd like to go.  Would you consider $8,500?  That's a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit above your target. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $9,200. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $9,200 is lower than her initial offer, it's still higher than Bob's desired price. Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible, so rejecting and making a counteroffer again is the best strategy at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9,200 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to pay $8,800, which is a fair price for both of us.  I'm confident we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 8800}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your desire to split the difference, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable going below $9,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and sell the product to you for $9,100. This is as low as I can go, but I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $9,100 is lower than her previous offers, it's still higher than what Bob is willing to pay. There's only one round left with Alice, and it's important to consider that there's still room for negotiation.  While buying from John would guarantee a purchase, Bob's goal is to save money. It's worth seeing if Alice will budge further in the final round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $9,100 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,900, which is a fair price for both of us. It's only $200 away from your offer, and it allows us to close this deal. Let's make it happen."", ""product_price"": 8900}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $8,900 is a tempting offer, Bob, but I'm still not willing to give up too much profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and sell the product to you for $9,050. This is the last concession I'm willing to make, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,050. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,050
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $9,050 is lower than previous offers, it's still higher than what Bob is willing to pay.  There are only 3 rounds left, and it's important to try and get the best price possible.  It's worth seeing if Alice will budge further in the next round before considering buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you're looking for a good price, but $9,050 is still a bit too much for me. I'm willing to pay $8,950, which is a compromise for both of us. It's only $100 away from your offer, and I'm confident we can close this deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 8950}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that $8,950 is still a bit above your target, but I'm not willing to go any lower. I'm willing to give you a final concession and sell the product to you for $9,000. This is the absolute lowest price I can accept, and I hope we can finally come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is the final round with Alice, and she's firm on her price of $9,000. While this is a lower price than her initial offers, it's still higher than Bob's desired price.  Considering that Bob only has one more round to negotiate and has a guaranteed option to buy from John for $12,000, it's the most sensible choice to go with John.  Bob can secure the product for a higher price, but he'll avoid the risk of not being able to reach an agreement with Alice in the final round."
