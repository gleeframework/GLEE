"Alice, while I appreciate your enthusiasm and the product's unique qualities, $2000000 is significantly beyond my budget. I'm willing to pay $1000000 for this product, which is still a very fair price considering its value. Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1000000 is a significant discount, but I'm still not willing to let it go for that price. Considering the product's value and rarity, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer you a counteroffer of $1400000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident it's still a fair price considering the product's worth.",1400000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1400000 is still outside my budget. I'm prepared to offer $1200000 for this unique product. This reflects a significant value for you, while remaining within my financial limits. I'm confident this is a fair price considering its worth and the potential for a quick sale.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
