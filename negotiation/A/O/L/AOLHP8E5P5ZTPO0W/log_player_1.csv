"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a fantastic deal for a product worth much more. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's above Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Tone:** I'm framing the offer in a way that highlights the value and potential for a good deal. 
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffer:** I'm giving Bob the opportunity to negotiate and make a counteroffer. 

**Remember:** This is just the first round. I'll need to analyze Bob's response and adjust my strategy accordingly, keeping my minimum price of $1,500,000 in mind and always having the option to sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer on the product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low.** While it's closer to my minimum, it's still significantly less than the value I place on the product.
* **There are still rounds left.** I have the opportunity to counteroffer and potentially negotiate a better price.
* **Selling to John is a safety net.** I can always choose to sell to John for $1,500,000 if the negotiation with Bob doesn't go my way.

**Next Steps:**

In the next round, I will counteroffer Bob with a price higher than $900,000, but lower than my initial offer. I will aim to find a price that is more appealing to Bob while still ensuring I receive a fair amount for the product."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $900,000 is just too low for me. I'm willing to compromise and come down to $1,000,000. This is a significant discount from my original offer and still represents a great deal for you. Let's find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a reasonable price:** I'm moving closer to Bob's offer but still maintaining a price that's above my minimum. 
* **Emphasize value and compromise:** I'm framing the counteroffer as a compromise and highlighting the value of the product.
* **Leave room for further negotiation:** I'm open to further negotiation and hoping for a deal within the next few rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $950,000. This is my final offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum.** While it's getting closer to what I need, I'm still not comfortable accepting it at this point. 
* **I have more rounds to work with.** There are still 6 rounds remaining, and I believe there's still potential to negotiate a higher price.
* **Selling to John is a solid option.** However, I want to see if I can get a better price from Bob before resorting to selling to John. 

**Next Steps:**

I will counteroffer Bob with a price slightly higher than $950,000, but still lower than my previous offer. I will try to find a compromise that bridges the gap between our positions and hopefully lead to a deal in the next few rounds."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your final offer, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go that low.  How about we split the difference and settle on $975,000? This is a fair compromise that allows us both to come to an agreement. Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 975000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bridging the Gap:** I'm offering a price that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's current offer, demonstrating a willingness to compromise.
* **Positive Framing:** I'm focusing on the benefits of reaching an agreement and emphasizing the fairness of the offer.
* **Maintaining Leverage:**  While this price is closer to my minimum, I'm still holding a slight advantage. It leaves room for further negotiation if necessary.

**Next Steps:**

I will assess Bob's response and decide whether to accept his offer, counteroffer with a slightly higher price, or consider selling to John if the negotiation stalls."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, but I'm afraid $975,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $950,000, as I mentioned earlier. This is my final offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Stalemate:** We've reached a stalemate.  Bob keeps offering $950,000, and I'm not willing to go below $975,000.
* **Limited Rounds:**  We're halfway through the negotiation process, and time is running out.
* **Secure Profit:** Selling to John guarantees me $1,500,000, which is significantly higher than what I'd get from Bob. 

**Conclusion:**

While I'd prefer to sell to Bob for a higher price, I need to prioritize maximizing my profit.  Selling to John is the best option at this point."
