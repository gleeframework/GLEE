"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, though. How about $8500? That's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $8500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $7750. Can you consider that?",7750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but I'm really close to my bottom line.  $7750 just won't work for me. Let's split the difference - I'll come down to $8000. This is my final offer. Let me know if you're interested.",8000.0,Alice,5,
