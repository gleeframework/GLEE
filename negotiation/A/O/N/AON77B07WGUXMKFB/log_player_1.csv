Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product.  Given its unique value, I'm initially proposing a price of $22,000.  I'm confident you'll recognize its worth."", ""product_price"": 22000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $22,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product, given its value to me.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","Bob is significantly under my lowest acceptable price, but he's at least in the right ballpark now. I'll try to negotiate him up, but I need to be mindful of John's offer.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you working with me.  To be completely transparent,  $22,000 is quite a bit lower than I can go.  How about we meet in the middle at $18,000?"", ""product_price"": 18000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $18,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm firm on my offer of $10,000.  It's a fair price given the product's value to me.  Let's work together to reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","Bob seems pretty stuck at $10,000.  It's unlikely he'll go much higher. I'm better off taking John's guaranteed offer.
