"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. Would you be willing to consider that price?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $1,200,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's find a middle ground.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1,600,000, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $1,300,000. Can you consider that?",1300000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, $1,300,000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to compromise further and come down to $1,450,000. This is a significant reduction from my previous offer, and it's a price that reflects the true value of the product. I'm confident it's a deal we can both agree on.",1450000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,450,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to offer $1,250,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget constraints. Can you consider this offer?",1250000.0,Bob,6,
