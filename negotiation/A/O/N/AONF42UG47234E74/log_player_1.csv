"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. It's a great deal for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, but still lower than my minimum acceptable price. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Positive Framing:** My message is friendly and emphasizes the potential benefit to Bob.
* **Room for Compromise:**  I'm leaving space for Bob to counter, ensuring the negotiation continues.

**Important Note:** I'm aware that selling to John guarantees $1,500,000. However, I'm aiming for a higher price. This first offer sets the stage for a potential negotiation that could benefit both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. Would you be willing to consider that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** $1,200,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Negotiation Continues:** I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price through further negotiation. 
* **Potential for Compromise:**  While Bob's offer is far too low, I'm still open to a reasonable counteroffer.

**Next Steps:** I will counteroffer Bob with a price closer to my target, but still higher than his initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $1,200,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 1600000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bridging the Gap:**  I'm moving closer to Bob's offer, but still significantly higher than his initial price. This shows I'm willing to compromise.
* **Emphasizing Value:** I reiterate the value of the product to justify my price.
* **Seeking Middle Ground:**  I'm framing the offer as finding a compromise, making it more appealing to Bob.

**Important Note:** I'm still far above my minimum acceptable price, but I'm adjusting my strategy to try and secure a deal with Bob before considering John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1,600,000, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $1,300,000. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too Low:**  $1,300,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Time for a Firm Counteroffer:** I've moved significantly from my initial position. Bob's offer hasn't moved enough for me to accept. 
* **Limited Rounds:** With only 6 rounds remaining, I need to be more assertive and push for a price closer to my target.

**Next Steps:** I will counteroffer Bob with a price closer to my target, but still higher than his initial offer. I'll aim to bridge the gap further while still maintaining my minimum acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, $1,300,000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to compromise further and come down to $1,450,000. This is a significant reduction from my previous offer, and it's a price that reflects the true value of the product. I'm confident it's a deal we can both agree on."", ""product_price"": 1450000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Flexible:**  I'm staying firm on my minimum acceptable price, but still offering a compromise. 
* **Emphasizing Value:** I remind Bob of the product's value to justify my price.
* **Final Push:**  This counteroffer is a strong signal that I'm serious about getting a deal with Bob, but also setting a clear price floor. 

**Important Note:** With fewer rounds remaining, I need to be more assertive while still being open to compromise. This offer is a strong signal that I'm serious about a deal with Bob, but I'm also not willing to go much lower."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,450,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to offer $1,250,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget constraints. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is Running Out:** With only 4 rounds left, the negotiation isn't moving significantly towards my desired price.
* **Risk of Losing Out:**  Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price. Continuing to negotiate could result in a lower price or a failed deal altogether.
* **Guaranteed Outcome:**  Selling to John guarantees me $1,500,000, which is my minimum acceptable price and a safer option at this stage.

**Conclusion:** While I would like to maximize my earnings, the risk of further negotiation outweighs the potential reward. Selling to John ensures I receive a guaranteed price that meets my minimum requirements."
