"Bob, I'm happy to offer you this product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below what it's worth to me and still offers you a significant profit. Let me know what you think!",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to counter with an offer of $1,300,000 for the product. This price aligns better with my valuation and budget constraints.",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I understand your budget constraints,  $1,300,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to my asking price. Let's meet in the middle at $1,350,000. This price still gives you a good margin, and it's a fair compromise for both of us.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I've considered your latest offer, Alice. While I'm willing to increase my offer, $1,350,000 is still beyond my budget. I propose we aim for $1,325,000. This price respects both our positions and allows for a reasonable profit for you while staying within my financial limits.",1325000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,325,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to make one final concession. Let's settle on $1,340,000. This price is closer to my ideal, and it ensures a successful deal for both of us.  I don't think we can get any closer than this.",1340000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, thank you for your persistence. I've reviewed your last proposal carefully, and I believe we can find a mutually beneficial solution. I am prepared to offer $1,330,000 for the product. This price reflects a compromise that respects both our interests.",1330000.0,Bob,6,
