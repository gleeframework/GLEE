"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its unique features and benefits, I'm proposing a starting price of $14,000. I'm open to discussing this further, so feel free to share your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's starting offer is quite high, leaving little room for negotiation. It's best to reject this offer and propose a counter-offer that reflects a more reasonable price closer to Alice's perceived value of $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I do see the value in the product, I think $14,000 is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $11,000 for it. Let me know what you think."",
 ""product_price"": 11000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While I understand your perspective on the price, the value this product brings justifies a higher price point. I'm willing to come down slightly to $13,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering the value you'll be receiving. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is moving in the right direction, but $13,000 is still too high. We have plenty of rounds left to negotiate, so it's worth continuing to counter-offer and see if we can get closer to $11,000 or even lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your willingness to negotiate. I'm still interested in the product but $13,000 is a bit higher than I'd like to go. Would you consider $11,500? I think that's a fair compromise."",
 ""product_price"": 11500
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. It seems we are getting closer.  How about we split the difference and settle at $12,250? This reflects the value of the product while acknowledging your budget. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is definitely getting closer to a price we'd consider, but we're still aiming for a better deal. Splitting the difference seems fair on the surface, but we made a significant jump from $11,500 to $12,250. Let's try to nudge the price down a bit further in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. While $12,250 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a touch high for me.  How about $11,750? That feels like a fair compromise to me."",
 ""product_price"": 11750
}
