"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I do see the value in the product, I think $14,000 is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $11,000 for it. Let me know what you think.",11000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While I understand your perspective on the price, the value this product brings justifies a higher price point. I'm willing to come down slightly to $13,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering the value you'll be receiving. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thanks for your willingness to negotiate. I'm still interested in the product but $13,000 is a bit higher than I'd like to go. Would you consider $11,500? I think that's a fair compromise.",11500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. While $12,250 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a touch high for me.  How about $11,750? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",11750.0,Bob,6,
