Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $10,000. I believe it provides significant value, and I'm confident you'll find it worthwhile. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a price closer to Bob's maximum perceived value.
* **Justification:** While not essential, hinting at the product's value can make a higher price more palatable.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone is suggestive, not demanding. This invites Bob to counter-offer, starting a negotiation.

**Important Considerations:**

* This strategy assumes some flexibility in Bob's budget and a willingness to pay a premium if he finds the product valuable. 
* It's crucial to gauge Bob's interest and adjust your approach in subsequent messages based on his responses."
