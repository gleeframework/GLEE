Alice's offer: The product price will be $95.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
It's better to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price. You have room to negotiate since you're willing to pay $80, and Alice is willing to sell for $100."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

It's still worth trying to negotiate further. You can likely get a better price than $90, and you have the option to buy from John for $80 as a fallback."

``` 
Alice is getting closer to your price, but it's better to take the guaranteed deal with John at $80. You're only one round away from running out of time, and there's no guarantee Alice will accept your next offer."
