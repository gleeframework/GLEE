{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

$800,000 is a good price, but it's still possible to get it lower.  Since I have 10 rounds, I want to see if I can negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 600000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming for a 25% discount from Alice's initial price. This shows I'm serious about negotiating and willing to walk away if necessary.  I'm hoping this will push Alice to consider a lower price, but I'm prepared to adjust my offer if needed in subsequent rounds."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is willing to come down a bit, but I'm still hoping to get a better price. I'll counteroffer again, aiming to get closer to my ideal price point before considering buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 650000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly from the previous round, showing I'm willing to compromise. This is a good middle ground between my previous offer and Alice's latest counteroffer. I'm hoping to reach an agreement within the next few rounds."

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $725,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down significantly from her original offer and is now within a reasonable range of my target price.  While I would love to negotiate further, I'm concerned about running out of rounds. Accepting this offer ensures I get the product at a good price while minimizing the risk of having to buy from John at a much higher price."
