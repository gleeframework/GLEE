"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand you're looking to spend less, but I need to make a profit on this deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $9000. Let me know if this works for you.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet halfway, but $9000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to spend.  I'm willing to pay $8500.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",8500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to get the best deal, Bob. However, I've already compromised by meeting you halfway and then again by reducing the price from $9000 to $8500 was not acceptable. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'm counteroffering at $8750. This is my final offer, so let me know if it works for you.",8750.0,Alice,5,
