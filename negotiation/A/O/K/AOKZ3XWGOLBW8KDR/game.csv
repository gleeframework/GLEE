"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $13,500. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $15,000. I believe it's a fair starting point for our negotiation.",13500.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer Alice, but I'm hoping to get a better price.  I'm willing to pay $12,500 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering your own valuation and the fact that I could get it for $15,000 elsewhere.  What do you think?",12500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm still looking to get a better price for the product. Considering our initial discussion, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $14,000. This is a fair compromise, taking into account the product's value to you and my own minimum price. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. I'm still trying to stay within my budget, and I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. How about $13,000? It's a fair price that's closer to my preferred range and still gives you a good profit. Let's make this happen!",13000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not comfortable selling the product for $13,000, as it's below my minimum price. Considering our previous discussions, I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $13,750. This is a final compromise, and I hope we can reach an agreement at this price.",13750.0,Alice,5,
