Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its worth, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,500,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 1500000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,500,000 is well above my budget.  Given the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $800,000.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $800,000 is significantly below its true value.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,200,000?  This feels like a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 1200000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,200,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm prepared to go up to $950,000, which is closer to my initial offer.  Let's try to reach an agreement that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

While Bob is moving closer to my price, it's clear he's unlikely to reach $1,000,000 quickly. John offers a guaranteed $1,000,000 which, at this point, is preferable to the risk of continuing negotiations with Bob."
