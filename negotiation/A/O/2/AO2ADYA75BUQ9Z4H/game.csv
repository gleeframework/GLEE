"Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its worth, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,500,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts?",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,500,000 is well above my budget.  Given the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $800,000.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $800,000 is significantly below its true value.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,200,000?  This feels like a fair compromise.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,200,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm prepared to go up to $950,000, which is closer to my initial offer.  Let's try to reach an agreement that works for both of us.",950000.0,Bob,4,
