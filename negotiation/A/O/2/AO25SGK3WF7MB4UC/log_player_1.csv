Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value to someone with your expertise, I'm proposing a price of $925,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I do have other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 925000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's $1,000,000 valuation as possible, maximizing profit over selling to John.
* **Negotiating Room:** Starting high allows room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.
* **Sense of Urgency:** Mentioning ""other interested parties"" motivates Bob to act quickly.
* **Justification:**  Hinting at the product's value to Bob (""your expertise"") provides a reason for the high price.

This strategy aims to secure a price significantly higher than John's offer while leaving Bob feeling like he's getting a reasonable deal on something valuable to him."
