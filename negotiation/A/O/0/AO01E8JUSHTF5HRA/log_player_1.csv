Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $11,999. I think it would be incredibly valuable to you, however, if you choose to pass, I do have another interested buyer."",
""product_price"": 11999
}
``` 
 
**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** The goal is to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($8,000) as possible while still exceeding your minimum price ($12,000).
* **Create Urgency:**  Mentioning another buyer (John) introduces a sense of urgency and scarcity, potentially pushing Bob to act quickly. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** While the offer is high, it leaves a small window for Bob to potentially counter-offer. If Bob engages in negotiation, you can slightly lower the price while still staying above your minimum.

**Important Note:** This is a starting point.  How you adjust your strategy will depend on Bob's response and any information you gather during potential negotiations."
