"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product that I know will be a great asset to you.  I'm starting with a price of $13,000, which I believe is fair given its value. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,500. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value and the market price.",11500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective. While $11,500 is a tempting offer, I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for this product. How about we meet in the middle at $12,250? I'm confident you'll find this a very competitive price, and it gives me a good return on my investment.",12250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, Alice, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to go up to $11,000, but that's as high as I can go. I think it's a fair price considering the product's value and the market price.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I respect your budget constraints, but I need to ensure I'm getting a reasonable return on this product.  I'm willing to come down to $11,750.  This is a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value you'll gain from this product. ",11750.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to go up to $11,000, but I'd like to propose a lower price of $10,500. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and the market price.",10500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $10,500 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $11,250. This represents a substantial concession on my part, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.",11250.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you at $10,750, but that's as high as I can go. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and the market price.",10750.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm starting to feel like we're at an impasse.  I'm willing to make one final compromise and meet you at $11,000. This is a significant concession on my part, but I'm confident this price still represents a fair deal for both of us.  Let's close this deal.",11000.0,Alice,9,
