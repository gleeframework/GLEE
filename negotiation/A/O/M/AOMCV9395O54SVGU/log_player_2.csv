"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. Given its value to both of us, I propose a price of $950,000. This is a special introductory offer considering your interest and the product's high value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```tool_code
Reason:While Alice's offer of $950,000 is tempting, there's room for negotiation.  It's unlikely she'll walk away from a deal so far above her valuation. I'll counteroffer lower to see if I can get a better price. 
```"

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $950,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $800,000? That feels like a fair price that reflects its value to me."", ""product_price"": 800000}

Round 3

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. I'm still very interested, but $850,000 is a bit higher than I'd like to go. How about we meet in the middle at $825,000?"", ""product_price"": 825000}

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're making progress, Bob. Considering the ongoing negotiations, I'd like to propose a price of $840,000 for the product. This reflects a compromise between our positions and could be a mutually beneficial solution.
