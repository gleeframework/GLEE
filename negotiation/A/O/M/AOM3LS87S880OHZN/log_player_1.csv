"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $10,000, which is above Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive Framing:** I'm using positive language to highlight the value of the product and encourage Bob to consider the offer.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message makes it clear that I'm open to negotiation, which could lead to a mutually beneficial outcome. 
* **Backup Plan:**  I'm keeping John in mind as a backup option if the negotiation with Bob doesn't work out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit too high for my budget.  Would you consider $6,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $6,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. 
* **Negotiation potential:** I believe there is still room for negotiation. Bob is clearly interested in the product, and we can try to find a middle ground. 
* **Time on my side:** We have 8 rounds left, and I can afford to continue negotiating with Bob. 

**Next Step:** I will make a counteroffer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate your interest!  While $6,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to come down to $8,500. This is still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-offer:**  I'm rejecting Bob's low offer but showing flexibility by offering a price that's closer to his perceived value.
* **Reasonable Compromise:** $8,500 is a reasonable compromise that still allows me to earn a substantial amount. 
* **Reiterate Value:**  I'm emphasizing the deal's value to Bob to encourage him to accept. 
* **Closing the Gap:**  I'm signaling my desire to close the deal, but leaving some room for further negotiation if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $8,500 is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $7,000. Would you be willing to meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still too low:** While Bob is getting closer to my minimum, $7,000 is still below my acceptable price point.
* **Negotiation space:** We have six rounds left, and I'm confident we can find a middle ground that works for both of us.
* **Holding firm:** I need to hold firm on my price to avoid selling at a loss.

**Next Step:** I will make another counteroffer in the next round, aiming for a price closer to my ideal outcome."

```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing flexibility by coming down from $8,500 to $7,500, but still remaining above Bob's current offer.
* **Appealing to fairness:** I'm framing the price as ""fair for both of us,"" which could appeal to Bob's sense of equity.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, you're getting closer!  How about we split the difference and settle at $7,250?

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:** While Bob is getting very close, $7,250 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.
* **Negotiation potential:** We have four rounds left, and I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.
