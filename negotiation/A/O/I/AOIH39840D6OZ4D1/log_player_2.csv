"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $119. I believe it holds significant value, and this price reflects its worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $119. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $119
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Buying from Alice for $119 is cheaper than buying from John for $120.
* While the product is only worth $80 to Alice, this doesn't affect your decision, as your goal is to get the best price, not necessarily a ""fair"" price."
