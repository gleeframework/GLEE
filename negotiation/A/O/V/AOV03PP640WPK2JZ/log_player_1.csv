"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the chance to purchase this product. I know you'll find immense value in it. I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000. This is a starting point for our discussion, and I'm open to hearing your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I begin with a price significantly higher than both my minimum ($1,000,000) and Bob's perceived value ($800,000). This provides room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's eagerness.
* **Open to Negotiation:** My message explicitly states my willingness to negotiate.  This encourages Bob to participate actively and potentially reveal more about his valuation.
* **Anchoring:** By starting with a high number, I aim to anchor the negotiation in my favor. Even if Bob rejects this initial offer, his counteroffer might be influenced by this high starting point.

**Important Considerations:**

* While I have the option to sell to John for $1,000,000, I want to explore if I can secure a better deal with Bob.
* I need to carefully observe Bob's reactions and counteroffers in subsequent rounds to adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for considering my budget. I understand the value of the product, but I am only able to offer $950,000. I hope we can reach an agreement that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's counteroffer of $950,000 is getting closer to my minimum price, but it's still below what I'm willing to accept. I believe there's room for negotiation. By rejecting his offer, I signal that I'm looking for a higher price and encourage him to improve his offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While your offer is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit below the value I place on this product. To move things forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the true worth of what's being offered."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** I've made a significant concession from my initial price, coming down by $150,000. This shows Bob I'm flexible and willing to negotiate. 
* **Maintaining a Strong Position:** However, my counteroffer is still substantially higher than both his offer and my absolute minimum. I want to keep a firm anchor on the price and signal that I'm not desperate to close a deal at any cost.
* **Justification:** I've provided a brief justification for the price, emphasizing the inherent value of the product. This reinforces the idea that I'm not just bargaining arbitrarily.

**Looking Ahead:**

I'm curious to see Bob's reaction to this counteroffer.  It will reveal a lot about how much he values the product and his willingness to pay a premium for it.  I'm prepared to adjust my strategy in the next round based on his response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate your flexibility. I would like to counter with an offer of $1,050,000. I hope this helps us reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,050,000 is now above my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. While I could try to push for a slightly higher price in the next round, there's a risk that Bob might walk away or that our negotiations could drag on, potentially causing me to miss out on a good deal. 

Accepting this offer ensures a profit and avoids the risk of continuing the negotiation."
