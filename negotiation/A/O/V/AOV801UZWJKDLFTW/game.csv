"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I agree the product is valuable, I'm working with a tighter budget. Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're working with a tighter budget, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000. Considering the product's value and its potential, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $1,050,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a price you'll find reasonable.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. How about we settle at $975,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're close, Bob, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go below $1,050,000. Considering the product's value and the fact that we're getting close to the lower end of the market value, I'm willing to make a slight concession. I can offer it to you for $1,025,000. This is my final compromise, and I'm hoping we can meet at this price.",1025000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, you're right, we're close! To bridge the gap, I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000.  This is a strong offer, and I'm hoping we can seal the deal.",1000000.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $1,000,000, Bob, but I'm still a bit short of my target. Considering the product's value and the fact that we're very close to the final stretch, I'm willing to make a final concession. I can offer it to you for $1,050,000, but only if you're willing to meet me at this price. If not, I'll have to explore other options.",1050000.0,Alice,7,
