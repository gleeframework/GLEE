"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $130 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $60?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I appreciate your interest, but $60 is well below what I'm willing to accept. Let's meet in the middle. How about $90?  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",90.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $75 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $85. Let's find a way to make this work for both of us.",85.0,Alice,5,
