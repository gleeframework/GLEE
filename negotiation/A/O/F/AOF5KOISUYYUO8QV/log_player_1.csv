"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $135. It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it's well worth the price. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 135}
``` 

This initial offer is a good starting point. It's a bit below my minimum acceptable price ($150), but it still gives me room to negotiate if Bob rejects it. I'm also being friendly and optimistic, which might encourage him to accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $125. Would you be willing to meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $125 is above Bob's initial valuation, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'll reject his offer and see if I can push for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm still not quite there.  I'm willing to come down to $130. That's a good price for you, and it's still fair for me. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 130}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant, but I'm willing to meet you halfway again. How about $127.50? That's my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $127.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $127.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not comfortable selling for that price. I'll reject his offer and see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $127.50 just isn't enough for me. I'm willing to go down to $129. It's a fair price for both of us.  Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 129}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close, but I'm still not comfortable with $129. How about $126? That's my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $126. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $126
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is getting lower, and we are running out of rounds. It's better to sell to John for $150 and guarantee a profit.  I'm not willing to risk further negotiations with Bob as I may end up with a lower price than what John is offering."
