Bob's offer:

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Since Bob is unwilling to go above $9,000 and my minimum acceptable price is $8,000, it's not beneficial to continue the negotiation. It's better to sell the product to John for $8,000 than to further reduce the price for Bob."
