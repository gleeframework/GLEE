Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to buy this product, which I know you'll find valuable, for $9,500. It's a fantastic deal!"", 
""product_price"": 9500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's $10,000 valuation as possible. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting high allows for potential negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer. 
* **Secure the Sale:** Offering a price significantly lower than Bob's valuation increases the likelihood he'll accept without pushing for a lower price.

By pricing high but still leaving Bob with a perceived gain ($500 savings), this offer maximizes the potential profit while still making the deal attractive to Bob."
