Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think would be really valuable to you. I'm asking for $100 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price of $100, knowing that Bob values the product at $120. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Room for Compromise:** This offer leaves space for Bob to counter without me feeling like I'm giving away too much profit.
* **Positive Tone:**  The message is friendly and inviting, which helps create a good starting point for the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for offering the product, Alice. I appreciate your suggestion, but my budget allows me to spend no more than $80 on this item. Would you consider reducing the price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Minimum Value:** While Bob's offer is the minimum I'm willing to accept, I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price.
* **Negotiation Potential:** Rejecting his offer allows me to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a better price.
* **No Urgent Need:** I'm not in a rush to sell, so I can afford to continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While $80 is my absolute minimum, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $90? This still leaves me with a decent profit, and it's closer to your budget."", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  This offer shows I'm willing to negotiate but also maintains a profit margin for me.
* **Middle Ground:**  $90 is the middle point between my initial offer of $100 and Bob's offer of $80.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm still friendly and understanding, hoping to build rapport."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still looking to stay within my budget. Could we possibly aim for $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:**  $85 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $80.
* **Potential for Further Negotiation:** While I could try to push for $90 again, I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely.
* **Time Factor:**  The back-and-forth negotiation is taking time, and I don't want to risk Bob changing his mind or getting a better offer elsewhere.  $85 is a decent profit, and accepting now is the most sensible option."
