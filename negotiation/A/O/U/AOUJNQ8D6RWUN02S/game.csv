"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product has potential, I think $950,000 is a bit steep. Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the price, however,  $700,000 significantly undervalues the true potential and worth of this product. I'm willing to negotiate, so I propose a price of $875,000. This reflects a more accurate valuation while still leaving you with a significant return on your investment.",875000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $875,000 is still a bit high for my budget. How about we split the difference closer to your last offer at $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,4,
