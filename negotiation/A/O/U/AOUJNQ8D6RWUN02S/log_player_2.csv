Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the price, however,  $700,000 significantly undervalues the true potential and worth of this product. I'm willing to negotiate, so I propose a price of $875,000. This reflects a more accurate valuation while still leaving you with a significant return on your investment.
