Alice's offer is getting closer to my desired price, but there's still room for negotiation. It's worth trying to see if we can get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

Alice's offer: The product price will be $725,000.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

Alice's offer is close enough to my desired price and we've already had several rounds of negotiation. It's probably not worth risking a further rejection and ending up having to buy from John at a much higher price."
