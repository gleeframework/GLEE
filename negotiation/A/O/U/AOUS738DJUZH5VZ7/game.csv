,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $8,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I can't go below $9,500. Let's meet in the middle. This product is truly worth it to you.",9500.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you're willing to come down to $9,500, but I'm still a bit far from that. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $9,000. Can we meet in the middle at $9,250?",9250.0,Bob,4,
