"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be really interested in. It's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for a fair price.  Let me know if you're interested and we can discuss the details. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","I'd like to reject Alice's offer. I'm looking to save as much money as possible, and $100 is higher than my budget of $120. I'll consider buying the product from John instead.
