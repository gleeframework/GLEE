Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this item to you today for $200. I think you'll find it's a great deal for what it offers."", ""product_price"": 200}
``` 
 
I am starting with a price significantly higher than my minimum and Bob's perceived value. This leaves room for negotiation while aiming for a higher profit margin."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the item, but I was hoping to stay within my budget. Would it be possible for us to negotiate the price down to $175? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $175. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $175
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $175 is a reasonable profit, I believe there's still room for negotiation. Bob's message suggests he's quite interested in the product. I'll counter with a price closer to his offer but still above my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate you countering. I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $185?  That's a very fair price for this."", ""product_price"": 185}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your price, Alice. I understand the value of the item, but I'm still looking to keep my expenses low. Could we perhaps agree on $180? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $180
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob is clearly interested but price-sensitive. $180 provides a solid profit margin, and continuing to negotiate might risk losing the sale altogether."
