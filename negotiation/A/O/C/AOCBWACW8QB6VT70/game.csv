"I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product's potential, $1,200,000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'm willing to offer $850,000, which is still a fair price considering the value you place on it.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $850,000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $1,050,000. This is a fair compromise that should satisfy both of our interests.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,050,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to offer $900,000, which is closer to what I can afford and still a good deal for you. Let's meet in the middle on this.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000. I can offer you a slight discount, but I need to make sure I get a fair price for the product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $950,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment.",950000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your need for a fair price, but $950,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $925,000. This is a fair compromise that should allow us to both get a good deal. Let's close this deal.",925000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're close to a deal, Bob. However, $925,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I get a good price for the product. I can offer it to you for $975,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment.",975000.0,Alice,7,
