{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Value to Bob:** The product is worth $15,000 to Bob.
* **Alice's Offer:**  $14,000 
* **John's Price:** $15,000

Accepting Alice's offer means Bob saves $1,000 compared to buying from John.  While Bob could potentially try to negotiate further with Alice, there's no guarantee of a better price.  It's in Bob's best interest to accept Alice's offer."
