"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to acquire a valuable asset. I believe it's worth a significant investment, and I'm willing to make a deal that benefits both of us. I'm offering the product to you for $1,000,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,000,000 is less than your maximum budget, you know you have another option with John for $1,200,000.  There's a chance Alice might be willing to lower her price further to avoid losing the sale. By rejecting this offer, you open the door for potential negotiation."
