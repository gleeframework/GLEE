I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's tempting to take the $90,  I'm confident I can get a better price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  $102 is a fair price considering the value of the product to both of us, and I don't want to risk losing the deal by continuing to negotiate."
