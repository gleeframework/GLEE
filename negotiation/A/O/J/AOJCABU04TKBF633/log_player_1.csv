"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and think you'd really love it. I'm offering it to you for $110. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price slightly above my minimum value ($100) to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Positive tone:**  I'm using a friendly and encouraging tone to make Bob feel comfortable and open to negotiation. 
* **Value proposition:** I'm highlighting the potential benefits of the product for Bob to increase his interest.

This initial offer sets the stage for a potential negotiation, while also providing an opportunity to see if Bob is seriously interested in the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. Would you be willing to consider a price of $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:** While $90 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired price point. 
* **Potential for higher price:** I believe I can still negotiate a better deal with Bob.
* **John's offer is a safety net:**  Having John's offer of $100 gives me the flexibility to reject Bob's offer without losing out on a guaranteed sale. 

I'll counter Bob's offer in the next round, aiming to bridge the gap between our positions."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! I'm willing to come down a bit, but $90 is still a little low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $95? That would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing flexibility by offering a price closer to Bob's offer, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate.
* **Middle ground:**  $95 represents a fair middle ground between my previous offer and Bob's, increasing the likelihood of agreement.
* **Focus on fairness:**  I'm framing the offer as a win-win situation for both of us, emphasizing fairness and mutual benefit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. Would you be willing to consider a price of $85? I think that's a more reasonable price for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:** $85 is well below my minimum acceptable price of $100.
* **Limited negotiation room:**  I've already made concessions and there's little room for further compromise.
* **John's offer is a sure thing:** Selling to John guarantees me my minimum price and avoids further negotiation with Bob. 

While I'd prefer to get more for the product, it's not worth risking a lower price or delaying the sale further.  John's offer provides a secure and acceptable outcome."
