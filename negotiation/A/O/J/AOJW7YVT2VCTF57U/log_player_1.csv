I'm starting with a price of $2,000,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value, but I believe it's a reasonable starting point. I want to see if Bob is seriously interested and gauge his potential willingness to pay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my minimum value, I believe I can still get a better price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1900000}
```

I'm going to counteroffer with $1,900,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still above Bob's offer.  I'm hoping this will encourage him to come closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While it's a bit lower than I'd like, it's still above my minimum value and a significant amount of money. Further negotiation might result in a slightly higher price, but the risk of losing the deal altogether is too high.  I'm happy to accept $1,700,000 and move on."
