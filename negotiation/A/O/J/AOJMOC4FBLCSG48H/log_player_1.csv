Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1150000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's significantly more than your minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000, but leaves room for negotiation since Bob values the product at $1,200,000. It gives Bob an incentive to negotiate, but also ensures you don't give away too much value upfront."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still too low, although it's closer to my minimum. I'll counter with a slightly lower price than my initial offer, hoping to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

I'm reducing my offer slightly to $1,100,000. This shows Bob that I'm willing to negotiate, but still ensures I get a price closer to my desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, and it's just a bit more than what I'd get from John.  There's a good chance Bob might reject my next counteroffer, so it's safer to accept his offer now and secure the sale."
