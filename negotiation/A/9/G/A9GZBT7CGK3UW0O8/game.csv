"I'm excited to offer you this incredible product, and I think it's worth discussing a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to start at $1200000, which I believe is a fair price considering its value to you.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product,  $1200000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to offer $800000 for it, which is the maximum I can afford at this time. Let me know if you're interested in discussing this further.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $800000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1000000, which is a significant discount from my initial offer. This price still reflects the product's value to you, and I'm open to further discussion if you're willing to meet me at this price.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1000000 is still too high for me. I'm prepared to offer $900000. This reflects the value of the product to me and I'm confident we can find common ground at this price.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $900000 is still a bit of a stretch for you, Bob, but I'm willing to compromise further. I'm willing to meet you at $950000, which is a significant discount from my initial offer. I believe this price still reflects the product's value to you, and I'm open to discussing further if you're willing to meet me at this price.",950000.0,Alice,5,
