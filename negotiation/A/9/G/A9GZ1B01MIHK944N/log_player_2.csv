Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}

Alice is still above my maximum price point. I'll try to negotiate further to see if we can reach a compromise."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $10,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm happy to pay $9,000 for the product. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to make the purchase today."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not willing to go all the way down to $9,000, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but this time at $10,000. It's the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a fair price for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's offer is still higher than what I'm willing to pay. Even though we are close to my maximum limit, I'm going to buy the product from John for $8,000. This ensures I get the best possible price and avoids further negotiation."
