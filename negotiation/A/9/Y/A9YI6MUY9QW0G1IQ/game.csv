"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $18000. This is a fair price considering its value to you is $8000. I'm looking forward to hearing back from you.",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think $18000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $12000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me is $8000. I hope we can come to an agreement.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer of $12000. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to sell it to you for $16000. This is a compromise that I think is fair, considering the value you place on the product and the value I place on it.",16000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $16000 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $14000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our initial offers. I hope we can find a mutually agreeable price.",14000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your latest counteroffer of $14000. I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers, so I'm proposing a price of $15500. This is the highest price I'm willing to consider, and I think it's a fair compromise given the value of the product.",15500.0,Alice,5,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Alice. I understand that you're trying to find a compromise, but $15500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. I'll meet you halfway between our last two offers, so I'll propose a price of $13500. I hope this is a price we can agree on.",13500.0,Bob,6,
