You have three options:

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than buying from John:** Alice is offering the product for $1,150,000, which is lower than John's price of $1,200,000.
* **Alice's offer is within your budget:** You're willing to spend up to $1,200,000, and Alice's offer is below that. 

Therefore, accepting Alice's offer saves you $50,000 compared to buying from John."
