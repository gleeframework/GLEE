Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your confidence in the product, but I'm a bit constrained on my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $9,000 for the product. I think it's a fair price considering the market value.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above $9,500. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so I'll offer $9,750 for the product. I think it's a fair price for both of us.

I'm going to hold out for a bit longer.  While $9,750 is getting closer, I'm still confident I can get a better price.  I have a few more rounds to work with before I need to sell to John."
