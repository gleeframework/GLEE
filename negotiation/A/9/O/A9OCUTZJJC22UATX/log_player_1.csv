Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe you'll find valuable. It's worth $150 to you, right? I'm willing to offer it to you for $140."", 
""product_price"": 140
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** You know Bob values the product at $150.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $100.
* **Maximizing Profit:** Offering the product at $140 allows you to capture a significant portion of the value difference ($40) while still ensuring Bob gets a deal ($10 discount).
* **Backup Offer:**  Knowing you have John as a guaranteed buyer at $100 provides leverage in negotiations with Bob."
