Round 2

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $95?  I'm confident you'll find this a fair price."", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $95 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $90. Let's meet in the middle and make this deal happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see you're willing to negotiate, which I appreciate.  $90 is closer, but I'm still not quite there.  How about we meet in the middle at $92.50?  This would be a fair price for both of us, and we can finalize the deal."", ""product_price"": 92.5}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $92.5 is still a bit high for me. I'm sticking with my offer of $90.  This is a fair price, and I'm ready to close the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $100. While I'd like to get a bit more, it's clear that Bob won't go higher than $90, and we've already gone through several rounds of negotiation. It's better to secure the $100 from John and avoid any further potential delays or complications with Bob."
