"Hi Alice, $110 is a bit too steep for me. I'm willing to pay $85 for the product. Let's see if we can make this work.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $95?  I'm confident you'll find this a fair price.",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $95 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $90. Let's meet in the middle and make this deal happen.",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're willing to negotiate, which I appreciate.  $90 is closer, but I'm still not quite there.  How about we meet in the middle at $92.50?  This would be a fair price for both of us, and we can finalize the deal.",92.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $92.5 is still a bit high for me. I'm sticking with my offer of $90.  This is a fair price, and I'm ready to close the deal.",90.0,Bob,6,
