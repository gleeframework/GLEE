"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to acquire a unique product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations."", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** We're aiming high to give ourselves room to negotiate down while still securing a price significantly above our minimum. 
* **Justification:**  While we don't reveal the product's worth to us, mentioning ""immense value and potential"" subtly hints at its significance and justifies the high price.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  Phrasing like ""initial proposal"" and ""starting point"" makes it clear that we're open to negotiation and finding a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I'm looking to save as much as possible. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value and the market conditions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,200,000 is a good offer, we still have room to negotiate. Bob's message suggests he's price-sensitive but still sees significant value in the product. We'll counter with a slightly lower price to test his willingness to move closer to our desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,275,000. This price reflects the true value of this unique product, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations."",
""product_price"": 1275000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** We're making a smaller concession ($25,000) than Bob's initial drop ($100,000) to signal that we're not desperate to close the deal at any price. 
* **Reiterating Value:**  We're continuing to emphasize the product's unique value to justify the higher price point. 
* **Compromise:**  By moving closer to his price, we show willingness to negotiate and find a mutually agreeable solution."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your willingness to compromise, but I'm still looking to save as much as possible. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value and the market conditions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Profit:** $1,200,000 is a significant profit margin over our minimum of $800,000.
* **Stalled Negotiation:** Bob has now repeated his offer of $1,200,000 twice, indicating he might be unwilling to go higher. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Continuing to negotiate risks losing Bob without guaranteeing a significantly better offer. It's better to secure a good deal now than potentially end up with John's lower offer later."
