"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $13,000, which is still a great deal for both of us.  Let's try to find a solution that works for everyone.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand your position. How about we meet in the middle at $11,500? That seems like a fair compromise.",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see your point, but $11,500 is still a little too low for me.  How about we split the difference and I offer you the product for $12,500?  This would be a great deal for you, and it would allow me to get closer to my asking price.  What do you think?",12500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, it seems like we're getting closer.  How about $12,000?  That's a fair price, and it would allow us to close this deal today.",12000.0,Bob,6,
