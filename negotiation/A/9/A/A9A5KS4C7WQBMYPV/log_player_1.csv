"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to offer you this product for $1,300,000. It's a significant investment, but I believe it will be well worth it for you.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm aiming for a price closer to my minimum value.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  $1,300,000 leaves space for a few rounds of negotiation without risking losing the deal entirely. 
* **Positive tone:**  A friendly and encouraging message can help build rapport and make Bob more likely to consider the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but that price is a bit too high for me. Could you do $900,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum:** I won't accept a price that's so far below my minimum value. 
* **There are still rounds left:** I can continue negotiating and try to reach a more acceptable price.
* **Selling to John is a safety net:** I can always choose to sell to John if the negotiations with Bob fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $900,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.  This reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a reasonable decrease:** I'm showing flexibility but still keeping the price above my minimum. 
* **Highlighting the value:** Emphasizing the value of the product to Bob helps justify the price. 
* **Positive and collaborative tone:** This encourages Bob to continue negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. $1,100,000 is still a bit more than I had in mind. Would you consider $950,000? That would make it easier for me to move forward. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:**  Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Negotiation is ongoing:** I have several more rounds to try and close the deal at a more favorable price.
* **John is always an option:** If the negotiations fail, I can sell to John and guarantee my minimum value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, and I'm willing to continue negotiating. However, $950,000 is still too far below my minimum. I'm prepared to come down to $1,050,000. This reflects the value of the product and gives us both a chance to close this deal.  Let's aim for a win-win situation."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small compromise:** I'm showing flexibility by lowering the price slightly, but not by much.
* **Emphasizing value:** I'm reiterating the value of the product to justify the price.
* **Positive and collaborative tone:**  I'm keeping the conversation friendly and focused on finding a solution that works for both of us. 
* **Moving closer to the middle:** I'm trying to find a price that's closer to the middle ground between our initial offers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  How about $975,000? I think that's a fair compromise and would allow us to wrap this up. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:** Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price.
* **Limited rounds remaining:** We have only four rounds left, and I want to make sure I get the best possible price.
* **John remains a viable option:** If the negotiations fail, I can sell to John and secure my minimum value.

I'm going to counteroffer Bob in the next round, but I'll need to be careful. I want to bridge the gap without going too low."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to see we're making progress.  $975,000 is still a bit below what I need to make this work for me. However, I'm willing to come down to $1,025,000. This offer reflects the value of the product and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement.  Let's aim to reach a final decision this round."", ""product_price"": 1025000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small compromise:** I'm lowering the price by $25,000, showing willingness to meet halfway.
* **Emphasis on value:** I reiterate the product's value to justify the price.
* **Urgency:** I suggest a final decision in this round, creating a sense of urgency for Bob.
* **Middle ground:** This offer is closer to the middle ground between our two positions.

This is a risky move because we're getting close to my minimum. However, I believe this is the best chance to reach an agreement with Bob before resorting to selling to John."
