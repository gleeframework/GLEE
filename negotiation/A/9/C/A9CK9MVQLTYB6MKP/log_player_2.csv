"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you my product for $1,100,000.  It's a fantastic opportunity for you, and I believe this price reflects its value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $1,100,000 is a good price, it's still above Bob's maximum value. There's room for negotiation, and it's worth exploring counteroffers to see if Alice will come down in price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your offer, I'm not quite ready to go that high. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. This price is fair considering my budget and the value of the product to me. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:** Bob wants to maximize his savings, so he's starting with a significant counteroffer, $50,000 below Alice's initial price. This shows Alice he's serious about negotiating.
* **Fairness:**  The price is presented as a fair compromise. Bob acknowledges the product's value but emphasizes his budgetary limitations. 
* **Opening the Door:**  This counteroffer gives Alice room to counter without immediately hitting Bob's bottom line. It starts a back-and-forth that could lead to a mutually agreeable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm still hoping for a price closer to my initial offer. How about $1,075,000? This gives us both room to compromise and allows you to get a good deal. Let's see if we can find common ground here. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Closing the Gap:** Alice has come down $25,000 from her initial offer, and Bob is only $25,000 above his maximum value. This is a good opportunity to close the deal and avoid further negotiation.
* **Risk of Rejection:** If Bob rejects this offer, there's a risk that Alice will counter with a higher price, pushing Bob closer to his limit.  
* **Buying from John:** While buying from John for $1,000,000 is still an option, accepting Alice's offer saves Bob some time and effort."
