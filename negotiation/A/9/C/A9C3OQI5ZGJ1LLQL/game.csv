"Alice, thank you for your offer.  While I recognize the value of this product, $1,800,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows.  I'd like to propose a price of $1,400,000.  I believe this is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",1400000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $1,400,000 is too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,600,000?",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,600,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,500,000. This is a fair price, and I'm confident we can reach a deal.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
