Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe I can find a better deal elsewhere. I am willing to pay up to $950000 for your product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $950,000 is a decent amount, it's still below the value of the product to me. I want to see if I can get closer to my asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but I'm not willing to go that low.  I'm sure you realize the value of this product is far greater.  Let's meet in the middle.  How about $1,050,000?  This price reflects both our needs and the exceptional value of the product."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

Bob's offer is now at the value of the product to me, and it's better than selling to John.  I'm going to accept it."
