"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, I'm afraid $1200000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1800000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and uniqueness. What do you think?",1800000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still interested in the product, but I think $1800000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'm counteroffering at $1500000. Can you consider this price?",1500000.0,Bob,4,
