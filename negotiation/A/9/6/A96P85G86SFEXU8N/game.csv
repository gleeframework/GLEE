"I appreciate your time, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, and I appreciate your interest.  However, $90 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $105. This is still a good value for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",105.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above $100, which is the price I'm aiming for. Would you be willing to meet me at $98?",98.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're sticking to your price point, and I appreciate your persistence.  While $98 is closer, it's still a bit below what I need. I'm willing to go down to $102.  This is a fair compromise, and I think it's a good deal for both of us. Let's try to close this deal.",102.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. I'm getting close to making a decision, but I'd like to try to get a bit closer to my target price. Would you be willing to meet me at $99?",99.0,Bob,6,
