"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,500,000. I'm open to discussing this further, but I believe this is a fair starting point considering the benefits it offers.

Alice's offer:
