"Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,500,000. I'm open to discussing this further, but I believe this is a fair starting point considering the benefits it offers.",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product has value, $1,500,000 is too high for me. I'd be willing to consider purchasing it for $800,000.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counter-offer.  However, $800,000 is significantly below its true value and potential.  I'm willing to meet you halfway â€“ how about $1,250,000?",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me. While $1,250,000 is closer, it's still a bit too high for my budget.  Could you do $950,000?  That would be a fair deal.",950000.0,Bob,4,
