{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $100, which is closer to my minimum value of $120. This gives me room to negotiate if Bob counteroffers. 
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a positive tone and highlighting the value of the product to encourage Bob to accept. 

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, I've made a good profit.
* If Bob rejects, I'll assess his counteroffer and decide whether to accept or make a new counteroffer, keeping in mind John's offer of $120 as my fallback option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate it, but I was hoping to keep my budget under $80. Would it be possible for us to negotiate the price down to $85? I'm really interested in purchasing the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  Bob's offer of $85 is significantly below my minimum value of $120 and even lower than what John is offering. 
* **Potential for Higher Price:** There's still room for negotiation. I believe I can get a higher price from Bob. 

**Next Steps:**

* **Counteroffer:** I will counteroffer Bob with a price that's closer to my minimum value. I'll also try to understand why Bob is so insistent on a low price and see if I can address his concerns. 
* **John as a Backup:**  I'll keep John's offer of $120 in mind as my fallback option if negotiations with Bob don't work out."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within a certain budget. While I appreciate your interest, $85 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but how about we split the difference?  Would you be interested in paying $95 for the product? This would still give you a great deal, and it would allow me to make a fair profit. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a compromise by splitting the difference between my previous offer ($100) and Bob's offer ($85).
* **Appeal to Value:** I'm reminding Bob that he's getting a great deal even at $95, emphasizing the product's value. 
* **Flexibility:** I'm showing flexibility by being willing to come down from my initial price, while still ensuring I get a reasonable profit.

**Next Steps:**

* **Analyze Bob's Response:**  I'll carefully analyze Bob's reaction to this counteroffer. 
* **John as Backup:** I'll continue to keep John's offer of $120 in mind as a safety net in case negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, given my budget constraints, I'm unable to meet the price of $95. I've done some research and found a similar product for $80 elsewhere. I believe this aligns better with my current financial situation. Thank you for considering my offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  Bob's offer of $80 is far below my minimum value of $120 and  even lower than what John is offering.
* **Limited Negotiating Room:**  It's clear that Bob is not willing to budge much on his price, and there's little chance of him coming closer to my minimum.
* **John Offers a Better Deal:**  John is offering me $120, which is a significantly better deal for me than what Bob is offering.

**Next Steps:**

* **Selling to John:**  I will sell the product to John for $120.  This ensures I get a good price and avoid further negotiation with Bob."
