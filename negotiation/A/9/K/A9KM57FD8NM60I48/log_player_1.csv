"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this valuable product to you for $140. I believe it offers significant value at this price."", ""product_price"": 140} 

**Reasoning:** Starting high allows room for negotiation. Since Bob values the product at $150, there's a good chance he'll accept a price slightly below that, especially if I frame it as a valuable opportunity."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $140 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $120 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:** While $120 is a reasonable profit, I believe I can still negotiate a better price with Bob. Bob's counteroffer suggests he's willing to pay more than his initial offer, so I'll aim for a price closer to $130 in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position but I value the product at a higher price point.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $130?"", ""product_price"": 130}

**Reasoning:** I'm aiming for a compromise to close the deal quickly. $130 is a good profit margin and still a favorable price for Bob compared to his valuation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the compromise, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'd be willing to pay $125 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**  Bob is incrementally increasing his offer, but it's unlikely he'll go much higher than $125. Accepting this offer secures a $25 profit, which is a good outcome.  Dragging the negotiation further with diminishing returns and the risk of losing Bob altogether isn't worth the potential $5 difference."
