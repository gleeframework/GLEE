Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of the strategy for Alice's offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Alice's Bottom Line:** Alice will accept no less than $1,500,000 for the product because she has another buyer (John) lined up at that price.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,200,000.  This means he won't pay more than this amount.
* **The Zone of Possible Agreement (ZOPA):** There's no overlap between Alice's minimum acceptable price and Bob's maximum price. This makes a deal impossible unless one party changes their valuation.

**Alice's Optimal Strategy**

Since Alice knows Bob won't pay more than $1,200,000, any attempt to negotiate within that range is pointless. Her best move is to offer a price slightly lower than John's offer to create the illusion of a deal for Bob.

**The Offer**

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product at a special price of $1,490,000. I believe it's an exceptional opportunity, and I'm confident you'll find tremendous value in it."", ""product_price"": 1490000}
```

**Explanation**

* **High but ""Discounted"" Price:**  The price is significantly higher than Bob's valuation, but slightly lower than what John is offering. This might create a sense of urgency or the feeling of a deal for Bob.
* **Confident Messaging:**  The message emphasizes the value of the product and avoids any hint of desperation on Alice's part.

**Outcome**

It's highly likely Bob will reject this offer. In that case, Alice moves on to John and secures her guaranteed $1,500,000. This strategy ensures Alice gets the best possible outcome in a situation where a mutually beneficial deal with Bob isn't feasible."
