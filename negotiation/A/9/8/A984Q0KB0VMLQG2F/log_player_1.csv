# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my desired price, I believe I can still get a better deal. I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can reach a compromise."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $9,500 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,800. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product. Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 9800}
