"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $8,000 for the product. Let me know what you think.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, though. How about $10,500? It's still a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you say?",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  While I understand the product's value, I'm trying to stick to a budget. Would you consider $9,000? That's a significant jump from my previous offer.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9,000 is still too far off from what I need to make this worthwhile.  I'm willing to go down to $9,500. This is my final offer, and if you're serious about acquiring this product, I think we can close the deal. What do you say?",9500.0,Alice,5,
