"Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe will be valuable to you. I'm offering it to you for $10,000. This is a great price, as it's significantly less than its value to me. Let me know what you think!",10000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'd like to see if we can meet in the middle.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer.  However, $8,500 is quite a bit below what I need to make this worthwhile. How about we split the difference and go with $9,250? This would still be a great deal for you, considering the value of the product.",9250.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand your perspective, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $9,000. I think that's a fair price considering the value of the product and my budget.",9000.0,Bob,4,
