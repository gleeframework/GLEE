"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,100,000, which is a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.** While it's a good starting point, it's still above your maximum budget of $1,000,000.
* **There's room for negotiation.** You can potentially get a better price from Alice.
* **John is a backup option.** If you can't reach a deal with Alice, you have a guaranteed way to purchase the product for your maximum price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you starting the negotiation.  However, $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to offer $950,000 for the product.  This reflects its value to me and leaves room for a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000, which is a compromise between our initial offers. I believe this price reflects the product's value and is a fair deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high.** While she's come down, it's still above your ideal budget.
* **You have room to negotiate further.** A counteroffer could potentially bring the price closer to your maximum.
* **John is still a viable backup.**  You can always go with John if the negotiations with Alice stall."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However,  $1,050,000 is still a bit higher than I can go at this point. Let's try to bridge the gap. I'm willing to offer $1,000,000 for the product. This is my final offer, and it reflects its value to me."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I'm willing to meet you at $1,020,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,020,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,020,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high.**  Even with the concession, $1,020,000 exceeds your maximum budget.
* **Negotiations are getting tough.** Alice is unlikely to come down further, and continuing to negotiate risks losing her entirely.
* **John is the best option.** You have a guaranteed deal with John for your maximum price, and there's a chance that Alice will come back with a better offer later if you walk away."
