"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product.  I think it would be perfect for you and I'm confident you'll find it worth every penny.  How about we start the conversation at $10,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject the offer.  $10,000 is way over his budget, and he can get the product for $8,000 from John. It makes sense to try and negotiate with Alice first, but if she doesn't come down significantly, he should just buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $10,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is capped at $8,000. Would you be willing to consider that?"", ""product_price"": 8000}
