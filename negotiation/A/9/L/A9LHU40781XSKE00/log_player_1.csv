Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $140. It's in great condition and worth a lot to the right person. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

This offer starts at a high price, but it's still below the value Bob places on the product. It leaves room for negotiation, while also allowing me to make a good profit.  I'm hoping Bob will accept, but I'm also prepared to negotiate further if he makes a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $130. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $130 is a decent price, I'm still hoping to get closer to my initial asking price. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can push for a slightly higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping to get closer to $140. Would you consider $135?  It's a fair price considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 135}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $130. Would you be willing to meet me at $132? It's a good compromise, and I think we can both be happy with that price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $132. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $132
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

$132 is a good price considering Bob's initial offer and the potential of further negotiation.  It's closer to my desired price and avoids the risk of going back and forth or ultimately selling to John for a lower price."
