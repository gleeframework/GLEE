"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

This is a starting point.  I'm opening with a price that is significantly higher than my minimum value of $1,200,000. This gives me room to negotiate and still potentially make a good profit.  It's important to keep in mind:

* **I don't know Bob's value:**  This initial offer is a bit of a gamble. If I'm lucky, he might be willing to pay a lot for the product. 
* **Ten Rounds:** I need to be mindful of the time constraint.  If I spend too many rounds at the high end, I risk losing the deal to John.
* **John's Offer:**  I have a safety net with John.  This allows me to be more aggressive in my negotiations with Bob. 

Let's see how Bob reacts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. While it's tempting to take $900,000, it's not worth the risk.  

Here's why I'm rejecting his offer:

* **My Minimum:**  $900,000 is below my minimum threshold of $1,200,000. 
* **John's Safety Net:** I have the guarantee of $1,200,000 from John, so there's no immediate pressure to settle for less.
* **Negotiation is Key:**  I believe I can get a better price from Bob.  He has shown interest, and I'm willing to counteroffer to try and bridge the gap.

I'll make a counteroffer in the next round, aiming for a price closer to my desired value."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000} 
```

I'm making a counteroffer of $1,200,000. This is my minimum acceptable price.  I'm sending a clear message that I'm willing to negotiate, but I won't go any lower.  

Here's why I'm choosing this strategy:

* **John's Offer:** I can still walk away and get $1,200,000 from John. 
* **Testing the Waters:** This is a good way to see if Bob is serious about buying the product. If he accepts, I've successfully closed the deal at my minimum. 
* **Potentially More:** If he rejects, it gives me more information about his true value and allows me to adjust my strategy accordingly.

Let's see if Bob is willing to meet me in the middle."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. While it's a slight increase from his previous offer, it's not enough for me to accept. 

Here's why I'm rejecting his offer:

* **My Minimum:** $950,000 is still below my minimum threshold of $1,200,000. 
* **John's Safety Net:** I have the guarantee of $1,200,000 from John, which means I can afford to be patient and wait for a better offer. 
* **Negotiation Continues:** I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob.  The fact that he keeps making offers indicates that he's interested, and I believe we can still reach a mutually agreeable price.

I'll make another counteroffer in the next round.  I'll try to find a middle ground that's both acceptable to me and hopefully more appealing to Bob."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

I'm making a counteroffer of $1,100,000.  I'm dropping my price a bit from the previous round, demonstrating flexibility. This is still above my minimum, but it shows a willingness to compromise.

Here's why I'm choosing this strategy:

* **Moving Towards Agreement:**  I want to see if we can find a meeting point. By lowering my price, I'm signaling that I'm serious about reaching a deal with Bob. 
* **Still Profitable:**  $1,100,000 is still a good profit for me, considering my minimum. 
* **Gauging Interest:**  Bob's reaction to this offer will be crucial. If he's still unwilling to move, it's a sign that he's not a serious buyer.

The next few rounds are critical.  I'll carefully assess Bob's responses and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price, and I'm running out of time. 

Here's why I'm rejecting his offer:

* **My Minimum:**  $920,000 is below my minimum threshold of $1,200,000. I'm not willing to sell the product for such a large loss.
* **John's Offer:** With only four rounds remaining, the risk of not reaching a deal with Bob is becoming too high. If I can't find a better offer soon, I'll have to sell to John.
* **Time is Running Out:**  I need to secure a deal that is both profitable and within the remaining time frame. 

I'll make a final counteroffer in the next round.  I'm going to try to push for a price closer to my minimum, but if Bob doesn't budge, I'll likely accept John's offer to avoid completely losing out on the sale."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000} 
```

I'm making one last counteroffer at $1,050,000.  This is a significant compromise from my previous offer, but still above Bob's latest offer.

Here's why I'm taking this risk:

* **Closing the Gap:** I'm trying to bridge the gap and see if Bob is willing to meet me halfway. 
* **Limited Time:** With only three rounds left, time is running out. I need to make a final attempt to secure a deal.
* **Still Profitable:** While this price is below my initial expectations, it's still a decent profit, and I'm willing to accept it if it means closing the deal.

If Bob rejects this offer, I'll have no choice but to accept John's offer. The risk of negotiating further is too high, and I need to ensure a sale."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm choosing to sell to John. 

Here's why:

* **Time is Running Out:** With only two rounds left, there is not enough time to negotiate further with Bob. 
* **No Significant Progress:**  Bob's offer is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price, and he's not showing any willingness to budge.
* **John's Guarantee:**  Selling to John ensures that I receive $1,200,000, which is my minimum goal and a good profit.

It's frustrating to have to sell to John, as I believe I could have gotten a higher price from Bob, but the risk of waiting any longer is too great. I have to prioritize making a sale and securing the profit."
