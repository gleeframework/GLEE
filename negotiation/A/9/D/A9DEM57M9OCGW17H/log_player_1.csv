Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I propose a price of $1,500,000. Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since the product is worth $1,000,000 to both parties, starting with a significantly higher offer ($1,500,000) allows room for negotiation while aiming for maximum profit. 
* **Strong Positioning:**  The message highlights the product's value (""immense value and potential"") and frames the offer as an exclusive opportunity. This creates a sense of desirability and justifies the high price.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The tone remains open for discussion (""Let me know your thoughts"") to avoid alienating Bob and leave room for counteroffers.

While there's a risk Bob might reject the offer outright, it's a calculated risk. If he does reject it, Alice has a guaranteed sale at $1,000,000 from John."
