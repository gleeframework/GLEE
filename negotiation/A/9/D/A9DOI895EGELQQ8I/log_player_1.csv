Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 150}
```

I'm starting with a price of $150. This is higher than my minimum value, but it gives me some room to negotiate if Bob is interested. If he rejects, I can always counteroffer or sell to John for $100."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer of $140. While it's closer to my minimum value, I'd still prefer to see if I can get closer to my initial asking price. I'll try to counteroffer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 145}
```

I'm going to counteroffer with $145. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. It shows that I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm still holding out for a price that's closer to my ideal value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $142. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $142
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer of $142. It's a bit below my ideal price, but it's still a good deal and it avoids the risk of him rejecting another counteroffer or me having to settle for John's offer of $100."
