"Alice, thank you for the offer, but $850000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm really interested in the product, but I can only offer $600000 right now.  Let me know what you think.",600000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $600000. I appreciate your interest in the product, and I'm willing to consider a counteroffer. After careful thought, I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $750000. This is a fair price, considering the product's unique value and the effort that went into creating it. What do you think?",750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $750000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go to $700000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the value we've both discussed. What do you say?",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $700000 is your final offer, but I'm still not comfortable selling the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target price. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $725000. This is a compromise that I think is fair, considering the product's value and the effort that went into creating it. What do you think?",725000.0,Alice,5,
