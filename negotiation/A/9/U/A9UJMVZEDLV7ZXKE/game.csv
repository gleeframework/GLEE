"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you! After considering your potential interest, I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,200,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's value to you, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire this valuable asset. Let me know if this is something you'd like to discuss further or if you'd like to make a counteroffer.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you considering my interest. While I recognize the value of the product, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for it.  This is a fair price that reflects the value to me and allows for a mutually beneficial deal. Let me know if you're open to discussing this further.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer of $1,050,000. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, and I'm willing to consider your proposal. However, I still believe the product is worth more to me than that. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $1,175,000. This is a fair price that takes into account your valuation of the product and my own minimum requirements. Let me know if this is something you'd like to discuss further.",1175000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thanks again for your flexibility.  I understand your perspective on the value of the product, but $1,175,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this stage.  I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000 for the product,  which is a fair compromise and allows us both to get a good deal.  I'm confident this is a price we can both agree on.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your revised offer of $1,100,000. I appreciate your willingness to compromise, and I'm willing to consider your proposal. However, I still believe the product is worth more to me than that. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer: I'll sell the product to you for $1,125,000. This is a fair price that takes into account your valuation of the product and my own minimum requirements. If this is not acceptable to you, I'm willing to reconsider selling to John for $1,500,000.",1125000.0,Alice,5,
