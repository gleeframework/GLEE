"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire this valuable asset. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900,000. This is a competitive price, considering its worth to you is $1,200,000. I'm looking forward to your response.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I agree this product would be valuable for me, but $900,000 is a bit high for my budget. Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $700,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $850,000. This is a fair price, considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  While $850,000 is closer, it's still a bit of a stretch for me. Could we settle on $750,000? I think that's a fair compromise.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go below $800,000. I'm willing to make a small concession, though. I'll meet you at $790,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",790000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $790,000 is still a bit high for me. How about we split the difference and settle at $770,000? That would work well for me.",770000.0,Bob,6,
