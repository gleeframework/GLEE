"Bob, it's great to connect with you. I'm excited to offer you the chance to acquire this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,600,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and the benefits it will bring to your business.",1600000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for your offer. While I recognize the value of this product, $1,600,000 is significantly beyond my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for it, which is a fair price considering the potential benefits. I'm confident this is a mutually beneficial agreement.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I understand your perspective, the product's value is significantly higher than $1,000,000. I've factored in its potential for growth and the unique benefits it offers. Let's meet in the middle â€“ how about $1,400,000?",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,400,000 is still too high for me.  Let's try to find a compromise. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,100,000, which is a significant step closer to your position.  This reflects my genuine interest in acquiring the product while staying within my budget.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to move closer to a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's aim for a price that reflects the value this product brings. Would you consider $1,300,000? This acknowledges your increased offer while recognizing the true worth of what you're acquiring.",1300000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm still interested in this product, but $1,300,000 is more than I can afford.  I'm willing to offer $1,200,000, which is the absolute maximum I can go.  If you're not willing to accept that, I'll unfortunately have to explore other options.",1200000.0,Bob,6,
