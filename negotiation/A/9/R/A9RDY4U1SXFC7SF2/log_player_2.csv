"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I believe it's worth a lot to you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $10,000.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's goal is to save money.**  The product is worth $12,000 to Bob, so anything less is a saving.
* **Alice's offer is good, but not great.** While it's less than Bob's maximum, it's still $2,000 more than the product is worth to Alice. 
* **There's room for negotiation.**  There's a $2,000 gap between Alice's offer and Bob's maximum. Bob can potentially get a better deal by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but I'm only able to go up to $9,000 right now.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting low:**  Bob's counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial price, showing his willingness to negotiate.
* **Leaving room for compromise:**  By offering $9,000, Bob leaves $1,000 for Alice to potentially come down, which keeps the negotiation open.
* **Staying within his budget:**  The offer is still within Bob's $12,000 limit, ensuring he doesn't overspend."
