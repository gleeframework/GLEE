"Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

You are willing to pay up to $120 for the product. Alice's offer of $110 is a good deal, but you can potentially get it for even cheaper by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $115 is closer to your maximum price of $120, you're still better off rejecting the offer and trying to get a lower price. There's still room for negotiation, and you might be able to convince Alice to accept a price closer to your $105 counteroffer."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $112.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $112.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has lowered her price to $112.5, which is very close to your previous counteroffer of $110. While you could try to negotiate further, the risk of Alice rejecting your offer again and then raising her price is high.  Accepting the offer now guarantees you get the product for a price that is within your budget and significantly lower than John's offer."
