"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $10,000 is too high for me. I'm willing to pay $6,000 for the product. It's a fair price considering my budget.",6000.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I understand you're looking for a good price, but I'm on a tight budget. How about we meet in the middle at $7,500? That's a fair compromise.",7500.0,Bob,4,
