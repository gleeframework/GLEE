"Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While $750,000 is a tempting offer, it's a bit below what I need to make this work. I'm willing to come down to $825,000.  This is a significant discount from my original offer, but it still reflects the value of this product. Let's see if we can bridge the gap.",825000.0,Alice,3,
