"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you! I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're both aware, this product is worth $1,200,000 to you. Considering its value, I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000 for the product. I think this is a fair starting point, and I'm open to negotiations. What are your thoughts?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, I'm hoping to find it at a slightly lower price point. Would you consider $950,000?",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand your desire to negotiate the price, but I'm not quite comfortable with $950,000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm proposing a new price of $1,050,000. This is a fair compromise, taking into account the value you place on the product and my initial offer. What are your thoughts?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $1,050,000 is closer to what I had in mind, but it's still a bit high for my budget. How about we settle at $1,000,000 even? That would be a good compromise for both of us, I think.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your desire to get closer to your budget, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm not comfortable going all the way down to $1,000,000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to make another counteroffer. I'm proposing a price of $1,030,000. This is a reasonable compromise, taking into account the value you place on the product and our previous discussions. What are your thoughts?",1030000.0,Alice,5,
