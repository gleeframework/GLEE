"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you! I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're both aware, this product is worth $1,200,000 to you. Considering its value, I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000 for the product. I think this is a fair starting point, and I'm open to negotiations. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand your desire to negotiate the price, but I'm not quite comfortable with $950,000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm proposing a new price of $1,050,000. This is a fair compromise, taking into account the value you place on the product and my initial offer. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000

How about we settle at $1,000,000 even? That would be a good compromise for both of us, I think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your desire to get closer to your budget, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm not comfortable going all the way down to $1,000,000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to make another counteroffer. I'm proposing a price of $1,030,000. This is a reasonable compromise, taking into account the value you place on the product and our previous discussions. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,030,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,030,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

It's unlikely Alice will go much lower. Accepting at $1,030,000 secures a significant saving compared to John's offer."
