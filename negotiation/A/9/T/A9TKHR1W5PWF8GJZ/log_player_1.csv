You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","Bob's offer is lower than what I was hoping for, but it's still a decent price. Since the product is worth $10,000 to him, I think I can do better than $9,500. I'll reject Bob's offer and send a counteroffer.

I'll offer the product to Bob for $11,000.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","I've already rejected Bob's offer at $9,500 once, and I'm not eager to go back to that price. Since I've already made a few counteroffers, I think it's time to consider selling the product to John for $10,000. John is willing to pay the full value of the product, and I'm not getting any closer to my desired price with Bob.
