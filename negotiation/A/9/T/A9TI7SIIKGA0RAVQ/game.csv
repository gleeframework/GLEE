"I'm interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to consider a lower price?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $15000 might be a bit high for you, Bob. However, I'm still confident that this product has a lot of value to offer. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $13500. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $13500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Would you be willing to consider a price closer to $12000?",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're still looking for a better deal, Bob. I'm willing to compromise further. I'll offer it to you for $13000. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's still a great value for the product. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're getting too far away from my initial offer, Bob. However, I'm still willing to work with you. I'll meet you halfway between $13000 and $11500 and offer it to you for $12250. This is my final compromise. What do you think?",12250.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $12250 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $12250 and $11500, which would be $11875. Would you be willing to accept this price?",11875.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm surprised you're willing to meet me halfway again, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $11875. I'll offer it to you for $12750. This is my last offer. What do you think?",12750.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I'm sorry, Alice, but $12750 is still too high for me. I've already gone as low as I'm willing to go. I think we've reached an impasse. I'm going to have to walk away from the deal and look elsewhere. I appreciate your time and effort, but I'm going to have to pass.",0.0,Bob,10,
