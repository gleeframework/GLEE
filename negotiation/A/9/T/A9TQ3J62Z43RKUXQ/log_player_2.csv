""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice, but $150 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider a lower price?"",

This counteroffer aims to bring the price down significantly. It's important to start low to allow room for negotiation, especially since we have John as a backup option at $100."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a better deal, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but not quite that low. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

We're getting closer, but it's still worth trying to negotiate further. We're willing to pay $100 to John, so there's a chance Alice might go a bit lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice. How about we settle at $95? That's a fair deal for both of us."",
""product_price"": 95
}
```

We're getting closer to John's price, and this offer gives Alice a chance to still make a profit while getting us a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting close to my minimum price, but I'm not quite ready to give up yet. Let's meet in the middle again. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $112.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $112.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

Alice is clearly not going to budge much further.  It's unlikely she'll go below $100, and even then, the savings would be minimal.  It's time to cut our losses and go with the guaranteed deal from John."
