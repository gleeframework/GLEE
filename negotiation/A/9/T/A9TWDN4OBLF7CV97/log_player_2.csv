"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am delighted to present our product to you. Given its unique value and potential impact on your business, we believe it is worth $1200000. We understand its importance to you and aim to strike a fair deal. Please let us know if this proposal meets your expectations or if you would like to discuss further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is lower than her own valuation of the product, it's still higher than Bob's maximum budget.  There's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for your offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value you've placed on this product,  $1,200,000 is still a bit above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for it.  Let me know if this works for you."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:** Bob's counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, reflecting his desire to save as much money as possible.
* **Negotiation Strategy:** This offer sets the stage for negotiation. It's reasonable enough that Alice may consider it, but it's still a substantial discount from her asking price, leaving room for further counteroffers if needed. 
* **Alternative:**  Bob is aware of the alternative option to buy from John for $1,000,000, so he's not offering an absurdly low price that would risk losing the deal entirely."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I appreciate your interest in our product and understand your budget constraints. I am willing to consider your offer of $1050000. However, due to the high demand for this product, I would like to propose an adjusted price of $1100000. This allows us to maintain a reasonable profit margin while still making the product accessible to you. Please let me know if this revised offer suits your needs. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Current Offer:** Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is still above Bob's ideal price, but it's closer to his budget and significantly lower than her initial offer.
* **Alternative:**  Buying from John for $1,000,000 is still an option, but the potential savings of $100,000 by accepting Alice's offer are significant. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** While further negotiation could potentially yield a lower price, there's a risk that Alice might become less flexible or even reject any further counteroffers. 

Accepting Alice's offer is the most logical choice, balancing the need for savings with the risk of losing the product altogether."
