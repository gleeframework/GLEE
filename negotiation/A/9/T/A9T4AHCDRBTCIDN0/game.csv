"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $6,000 for the product. Let me know what you think.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6,000. I can do $9,000, which is a compromise between our initial offer and your counteroffer. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Thanks for countering, Alice.  I appreciate the movement. How about we meet in the middle at $7,500?",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're getting closer, Bob! However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $7,500. I can do $8,500, which is still a good deal for you, but also reflects the value I think the product has. What do you think?",8500.0,Alice,5,
