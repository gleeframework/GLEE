"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to purchase this exclusive product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start the conversation at $1,800,000.",1800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, $1,800,000 is a bit outside of my budget. I'm willing to offer $1,400,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering my desired budget and the value of the product.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1,400,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer you a discount, but I need to make a profit, so I'll counter with $1,600,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my initial offer.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to compromise, $1,600,000 is still a bit out of my reach. Let's split the difference. I'm prepared to offer $1,500,000, which is my absolute maximum. If this isn't acceptable, I'm afraid I'll have to consider other options.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I can see you're really interested in the product, and I'm willing to make one more concession. However, I've already gone a bit lower than I'd like, and I need to make a profit. I can offer you a slight discount, but I'll need to get closer to my target. I'll counter with $1,650,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident you'll find it reasonable.",1650000.0,Alice,5,
