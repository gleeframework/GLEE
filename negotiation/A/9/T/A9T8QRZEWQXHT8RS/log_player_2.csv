# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to purchase this exclusive product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start the conversation at $1,800,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Reason: Alice's offer is higher than what Bob is willing to pay. Bob should reject and attempt to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, $1,800,000 is a bit outside of my budget. I'm willing to offer $1,400,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering my desired budget and the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $1,400,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer you a discount, but I need to make a profit, so I'll counter with $1,600,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my initial offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Reason: Alice's counteroffer is still higher than Bob's maximum budget.  Bob should reject and continue to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to compromise, $1,600,000 is still a bit out of my reach. Let's split the difference. I'm prepared to offer $1,500,000, which is my absolute maximum. If this isn't acceptable, I'm afraid I'll have to consider other options."", ""product_price"": 1500000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I can see you're really interested in the product, and I'm willing to make one more concession. However, I've already gone a bit lower than I'd like, and I need to make a profit. I can offer you a slight discount, but I'll need to get closer to my target. I'll counter with $1,650,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident you'll find it reasonable. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,650,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Reason: Alice's final offer is still higher than Bob's maximum budget.  Since Bob has reached his limit, it makes more sense to buy the product from John at $1,500,000.  While there is a chance Alice might lower her price in future rounds, it's too risky to keep negotiating with limited rounds remaining."
