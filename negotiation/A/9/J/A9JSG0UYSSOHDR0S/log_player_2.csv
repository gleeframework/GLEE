"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you a great deal on this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is within your budget ($12,000 < $15,000).** 
* **It's a better deal than buying from John.**
* **While you could potentially negotiate a lower price with Alice, it's not guaranteed, and the risk of losing the deal altogether is too high.**"
