"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value you place on the product, but I believe I can find something similar at a lower price elsewhere. However, I am interested in discussing potential ways to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. Would you consider reducing the price by $500?",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $9500 is still a bit low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $9750? This way, we both get a fair deal. What do you say?",9750.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your willingness to negotiate, Alice. I appreciate your offer of $9750. In light of this, I would like to propose a price of $9600. I hope this suggestion is acceptable and brings us closer to reaching an agreement.",9600.0,Bob,4,
