Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000. I believe this reflects a fair deal considering the significant returns you'll gain."", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest. 
* **Justification:**  The message highlights the ""immense value and potential"" to justify the high price, framing it as an investment rather than an expense. 
* **Backup Plan:** You have a safety net with John, ensuring you won't settle for less than $1,200,000. This allows you to be bolder in your negotiation with Bob.

This strategy aims to maximize your profit while still offering Bob a chance to secure the product."
