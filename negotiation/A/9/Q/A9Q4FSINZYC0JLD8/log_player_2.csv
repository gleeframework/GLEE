"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I'm excited to present our premium product, which is tailored to meet your specific needs and expectations. Given its exceptional value and quality, we believe it would be a perfect fit for your business. We're offering this remarkable opportunity to you today at an exclusive price of $950,000. This is a limited-time offer, and we're confident it will provide significant benefits to your organization. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's initial offer of $950,000 is still significantly higher than Bob's maximum budget of $800,000. It's reasonable to reject the offer and attempt to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of your product, $950,000 is above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $750,000 for it. This is my best offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the value we both place on this deal."", ""product_price"": 750000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but reasonable:**  Bob starts with a bold counteroffer, significantly lower than Alice's asking price. However, it's not so low as to be immediately insulting. 
* **Highlights value:** Bob emphasizes the value he sees in the product, making it clear he's not simply trying to lowball Alice.
* **Best offer:**  This sets the stage for future negotiations by stating this is his best offer, implying further concessions are unlikely."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your prompt response, Bob. I understand your budget constraints and appreciate your interest in our product. In light of your offer, I am pleased to extend a counteroffer of $850,000 for the product. This is a special consideration given the importance of this transaction to both of us. I believe this price reflects a fair compromise while still providing substantial value to your business. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's counteroffer of $850,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his maximum limit of $800,000.  It's worth continuing to negotiate for a lower price, especially since Bob can still walk away and buy from John for $800,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $850,000 is still slightly above what I can afford. I'm prepared to pay $800,000, my absolute maximum.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product and the fact that we are both eager to close this deal. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final offer:** Bob states this is his absolute maximum, raising the pressure on Alice to accept.
* **Emphasizes mutual benefit:** Bob highlights the shared interest in closing the deal, suggesting a compromise is possible. 
* **Strong tone:** While polite, the message is firm, conveying that Bob is serious about this price."
