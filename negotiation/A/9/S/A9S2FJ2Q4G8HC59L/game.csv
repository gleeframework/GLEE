"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $1,400,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $1,050,000?",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,050,000 is too far below what I need to make this worthwhile. I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000.  This price reflects the value of the product and allows us both to walk away happy. Let me know if you're interested in this offer.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $1,250,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something closer to $1,100,000.  Would that work for you?",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,100,000 simply doesn't cover my costs.  Let's meet in the middle at $1,175,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows for a successful transaction.  What do you think?",1175000.0,Alice,5,
