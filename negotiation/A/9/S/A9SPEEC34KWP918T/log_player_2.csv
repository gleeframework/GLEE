"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1400000. It's a fantastic deal, and I'm confident it's worth every penny. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

You can potentially get the product for less than $1,400,000. Alice values the product at $1,200,000, so there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows you to explore a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. How about $1,300,000? It's still a good deal for you and a fair price for me. Let's see if we can make this happen."", ""product_price"": 1300000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1300000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $1350000? This still leaves you with a substantial profit margin and is a fair price for the value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,350,000 is a good deal. It's still within your budget of $1,500,000 and closer to your target price. While you could continue negotiating, there's a risk that Alice will walk away or you'll waste time and not get the product. Accepting the offer ensures you get the product at a price that's better than John's."
