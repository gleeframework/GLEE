"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the opportunity, $1800000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $1400000 for the product. Let's see if we can find some common ground.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer. While $1400000 isn't quite where I need to be, I'm willing to consider a price of $1550000. This would allow me to move forward with the deal, and it's a good price considering the value of the product.  We only have a limited time to finalize this, so let's see if we can find an agreement that works for both of us.",1550000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, and $1550000 is closer to what I'm looking for. However, I'm still only able to offer $1500000 at this time. If you're willing to accept that price, we can finalize the deal. Otherwise, I'll have to explore other options.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
