"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this valuable product from me. I've given it a lot of thought, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000. This is a competitive price, considering its worth to you is $1,500,000. I believe this is a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $950,000 is less than your maximum budget, it's still significantly higher than John's offer of $1,500,000. Rejecting her offer opens the door for negotiation or allows you to purchase from John at a much lower price."
