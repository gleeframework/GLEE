# Alice's message: I have a unique opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm open to negotiations, but I need to make a starting point. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $12,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, that starting price is a bit high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd need a more reasonable offer.  Would you consider $6,000?"", ""product_price"": 6000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a more reasonable price, Bob. However, $6,000 is still a bit low considering the value of the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about $9,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While $9,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still a bit hesitant. How about we settle at $7,500? That feels like a fair compromise to me."", ""product_price"": 7500}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a compromise, Bob. $7,500 is a bit closer to your initial offer, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you at $8,500, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. I'm not getting any younger, and I'd like to close this deal soon. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** 

Alice has come down in price, but she's still trying to get more than your maximum budget of $8,000. You have a guaranteed option with John at your target price. There's no point in continuing to negotiate with Alice when you can get the product for the price you want elsewhere."
