"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be interested in. It's worth at least $12,000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $10,000.  This is a great deal for both of us, as it's still below my minimum and a good value for you. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice's offer of $10,000 is below her stated value, you know you can get the product for $8,000 from John.  You should reject this offer and see if Alice is willing to come down further."
