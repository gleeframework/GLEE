While Alice's offer is getting closer to my budget, it's still higher than what I'm comfortable with. I'll counteroffer again, but if she doesn't come down further, I'll buy from John."

Alice has come down to $1,350,000, but I'm not willing to go any higher than $1,200,000. At this point, it's more cost-effective to buy from John, even though he's selling it for a higher price. I'm confident that I can get a better deal later if I need to replace the product."
