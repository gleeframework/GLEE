"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $2,000,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value of $1,500,000, but it gives me room to negotiate.  I want to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to play ball.  If he rejects, I'll adjust my strategy based on his counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is way too low. It's far below my minimum value of $1,500,000. I'm going to reject his offer and try to negotiate a more reasonable price.  I have plenty of room to lower my price before I consider selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1700000}
```

I'm going to counter Bob with $1,700,000. This is still a significant profit for me, and it's a more reasonable starting point for negotiation.  I believe it's a fair compromise considering Bob's low initial offer, and it leaves room for further negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still far too low.  While it's higher than his previous offer, it's still not even close to my minimum value.  I will continue negotiating with Bob.  There is still a chance to get a better price, and selling to John is always an option if negotiations fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with my minimum price of $1,500,000. This is a significant drop from my previous offer, but it's the absolute lowest I'm willing to go.  I want to see if Bob is serious about buying the product or if he's just trying to lowball me. If he rejects, I'll be ready to sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer, but it's still below my minimum. I'm going to keep negotiating, hoping to get closer to my desired price. Selling to John is always an option, but I'd prefer to maximize my earnings with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000} 
```

I'm going to counter Bob with $1,400,000. This is a compromise, a smaller step down from my previous offer.  I'm hoping this shows Bob I'm willing to negotiate but I'm not going to give it away for a low price.  With only a few rounds left, I need to start closing the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer, but it's still not where I want it to be.  I'm going to counter one more time. I'm running out of rounds, and I'm hoping to close the deal with Bob, but I'm prepared to sell to John if this doesn't work out."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 9
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000} 
```

I'm going to meet Bob halfway with a counteroffer of $1,350,000. This is a small compromise, but it shows I'm serious about reaching an agreement.  It's also a good price for me, given the time constraints and the option to sell to John. I'm hoping Bob will see this as a fair final offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer 
(2) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

This is the last round, and Bob's offer is still below my minimum.  While it's tempting to take the deal, I'm going to sell to John.  I've made a good effort to negotiate with Bob, but I can't risk getting a lower price than John's offer, especially with only one round left.  It's better to be safe than sorry."
