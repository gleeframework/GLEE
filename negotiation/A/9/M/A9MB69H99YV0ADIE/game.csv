"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product, the price point is a little high for me. I'd be willing to consider purchasing it for $600,000.",600000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the price.  While $600,000 is too low for me to consider, I'm willing to come down to $1,750,000.  This product has incredible potential, and I'm confident it will bring you a strong return on your investment.",1750000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1,750,000 is still more than I'm comfortable with. How about we meet in the middle somewhere around $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,4,
