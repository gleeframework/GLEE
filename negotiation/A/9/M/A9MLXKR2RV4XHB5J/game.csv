"Hello Bob, I'm excited to show you this incredible product! I think you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better offer anywhere else.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the potential value of the product, $900000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'd be willing to pay $600000.  Let me know what you think.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $600000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $750000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and your initial interest. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $750000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $700000.  This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing me to acquire the product while ensuring you get a reasonable return on your investment.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer $725000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",725000.0,Alice,5,
