Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000.  I believe this represents a fair deal considering its worth. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to $1,200,000 as possible. However, offering that price to Bob will surely lead to rejection.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $1,100,000 leaves space for potential counter-offers from Bob, while still staying significantly above his perceived value.
* **Highlight Value:** The message emphasizes the ""value and potential"" of the product, aiming to nudge Bob closer to Alice's valuation.

**Important Note:** There's a risk Bob might reject this offer. However, since Alice has a guaranteed buyer at $1,200,000, it's a calculated risk to aim higher initially."
