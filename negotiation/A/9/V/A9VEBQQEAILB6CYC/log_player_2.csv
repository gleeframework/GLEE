Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $5,000?"",

}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest but $5,000 is significantly below what I'm willing to accept. I'm willing to come down to $9,000, which is still a good deal for both of us. Let's find a middle ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm still not comfortable with $7,000.  My minimum price is $8,000, which reflects the product's value to me.  Let's meet in the middle at $8,500. This would be a great deal for both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**  At this point, Alice has made it clear her absolute minimum is $8,000.  Since you can buy the product for that price from John without further negotiation, there's no benefit to continuing with Alice. You maximize your savings by going with John."
