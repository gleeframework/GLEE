"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. My initial offer for the product is $18000. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than my maximum budget of $8,000. It's too early to buy from John, as I have 10 rounds to negotiate with Alice and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your initial offer is a bit too high for my budget.  I'm interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $8,000 at this time. Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my initial offer and your offer. My revised offer is $12000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial offer, it's still above my budget. I'm willing to continue negotiating, aiming for a price closer to my $8,000 target.  I still have 7 rounds left, so there's time to see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $12,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $9,500.  Let's find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I can see you're serious about this product, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I need to make a profit, and $9500 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but this time I'll go a bit lower. My revised offer is $11000. Let's see if we can seal the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still higher than my budget, but we're getting closer. I'm willing to continue negotiating and see if we can reach an agreement within my budget.  I have 5 rounds left, so there's still time."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your need for a profit, and I'm eager to close this deal. However, $11,000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to offer $10,000, which is a significant increase from my last offer. Let's work together to find a solution."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. However, I'm starting to feel that we're getting close to my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target. My revised offer is $13000. Let's see if we can meet in the middle one last time. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $13,000 is still outside my budget, and we are down to our last three rounds. I've made multiple counteroffers, and it seems like Alice is unwilling to come down to my target price. It's time to cut my losses and buy the product from John for $8,000, which is within my budget. While I might be able to continue negotiating with Alice, there's no guarantee that we'll reach an agreement within my budget, and I risk losing the opportunity to buy the product from John."
