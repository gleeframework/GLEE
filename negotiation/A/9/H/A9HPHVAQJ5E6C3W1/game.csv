"Alice, your initial offer is a bit too high for my budget.  I'm interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $8000 at this time. Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my initial offer and your offer. My revised offer is $12000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $12000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $9500.  Let's find a middle ground.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I can see you're serious about this product, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I need to make a profit, and $9500 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but this time I'll go a bit lower. My revised offer is $11000. Let's see if we can seal the deal.",11000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand your need for a profit, and I'm eager to close this deal. However, $11000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to offer $10000, which is a significant increase from my last offer. Let's work together to find a solution.",10000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. However, I'm starting to feel that we're getting close to my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target. My revised offer is $13000. Let's see if we can meet in the middle one last time.",13000.0,Alice,7,
