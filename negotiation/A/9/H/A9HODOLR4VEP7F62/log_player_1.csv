Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 180}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $180. This gives me some room to negotiate while still ensuring I get at least $120 for the product, which is my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

Bob's offer is too low. I'm rejecting it and will counter with a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 150}
``` 

I'm going to counter with $150.  This is still a good deal for Bob, as it's lower than my initial offer, but it still gives me some profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $120 is my minimum acceptable price. There's no point in continuing the negotiation since I can secure the same price from John. Accepting Bob's offer guarantees the sale, while continuing might risk losing both buyers."
