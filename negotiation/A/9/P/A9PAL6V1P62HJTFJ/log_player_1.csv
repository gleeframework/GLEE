"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a fantastic [product description, e.g., vintage camera] that I think you'd really love. I'm asking for $250 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  That's a bit more than I was hoping to spend. I'd be interested in buying it for $150.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is the minimum I'm willing to accept, I have 10 rounds and the potential to get a better price. I'll see if I can negotiate higher in the following rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $150 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $200?  It's still a great deal for a [product description, e.g., vintage camera] in this condition."", ""product_price"": 200}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $200 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $175.  Let's see if we can find a compromise here. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $175. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $175
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm still aiming for a higher price than $175. With 6 rounds remaining, I believe there's room for negotiation. I'll see if I can push Bob a little further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. $175 is closer, but I'm still hoping for a bit more. How about $190?  That's a fair price for a product in excellent condition like this [product description, e.g., vintage camera]."", ""product_price"": 190}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm getting closer to your price, but $190 is still a little too much for me. How about $180?  If we can agree on that, I'm ready to buy. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $180
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $180 is only $10 away from my last counteroffer. With only 4 rounds left, I don't want to risk losing a sale altogether. Accepting his offer is the most sensible choice, as it's above my minimum and leaves room for me to potentially make more in future negotiations."
