Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 150}
```

I'm starting with a price of $150, as it's a reasonable starting point. This gives Bob room to negotiate while ensuring I make a profit above my minimum. I'm hoping to gauge Bob's interest and see how far he's willing to go."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $100 is my minimum acceptable price, I'm not ready to settle yet.  Bob's offer is too low, and I believe I can get closer to my initial asking price with some negotiation. I'll counteroffer to see if I can secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 125}
```

I'm counter-offering with $125. This is a compromise from my initial price, but it's still above Bob's offer and ensures I make a reasonable profit. I hope this demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while also maintaining my desired profit margin."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob has moved closer to my price with his offer of $115. This is a reasonable price for me, as it's above my minimum acceptable price and still allows me to make a profit.  While I could continue negotiating, there's a chance he might walk away. Accepting his offer ensures a sale and minimizes the risk of losing the deal."
