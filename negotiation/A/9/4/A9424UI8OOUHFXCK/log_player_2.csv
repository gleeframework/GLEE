"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a competitive price of $14,000. I believe it will be highly valuable for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice's offer of $14,000 is significantly higher than both your maximum price ($10,000) and John's offer ($10,000).  It makes sense to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your offer, but $14,000 is too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider a price closer to $8,000."",
""product_price"": 8000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** This counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's asking price, but it establishes a strong starting point for negotiation. 
* **Leaving Room to Negotiate:**  Offering $8,000 leaves room to gradually increase the offer if necessary, while still staying well below your maximum budget.
* **Signaling Interest:** The message expresses interest in the product, encouraging Alice to continue the negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $8,000 is too low, I'm willing to negotiate. How about we meet in the middle at $11,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice is coming down, but $11,000 is still higher than your alternative option of buying from John for $10,000. You have room to negotiate further and see if you can get closer to your target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you being willing to move on the price.  While $11,000 is closer, it's still a bit more than I was hoping to spend. Would you consider $9,000?"",
""product_price"": 9000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Increase:** This counteroffer shows willingness to compromise by moving closer to Alice's price, but not too drastically.
* **Strategic Positioning:** Offering $9,000 keeps the negotiation alive while aiming for a price point that's favorable to you and potentially acceptable to Alice. 
* **Maintaining Open Communication:** The message continues a polite and collaborative tone, encouraging Alice to continue negotiating."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $9,000 is cutting it too close to my bottom line. I could be persuaded to accept $10,000, but that's my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice has come down to your maximum price of $10,000, which matches John's offer. There's no point in further negotiation or going with John, as you won't get a better price."
