Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on this product. I think you'll find it valuable.  I'm willing to sell it for $90. What do you say?"",
""product_price"": 90
} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  You want to get as close to Bob's $100 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $90 leaves some room for Bob to feel like he's getting a slight deal if he negotiates you down a little. 
* **Avoid a Too-High Price:** Offering it at $100 or close to it risks immediate rejection, pushing Bob towards John's guaranteed $80 offer."
