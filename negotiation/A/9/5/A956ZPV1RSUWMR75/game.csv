"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but that price is a bit high for me.  Would you consider $100?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $100 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $125.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  What do you think?",125.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. How about we meet in the middle at $112?",112.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $112 just doesn't work for me. How about we split the difference and go with $118? This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and it's a significant compromise on my end. Let's close this deal!",118.0,Alice,5,
