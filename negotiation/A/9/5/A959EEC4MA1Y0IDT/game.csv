"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which is valued at $100 to us. Considering its quality and uniqueness, I believe it would be worth $95 for you. Would you like to proceed with this offer?",95.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the quality of your product, but $95 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. I'm happy to pay $85 for it.  What do you think?",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and I respect your valuation of the product. I am willing to consider your offer of $85. However, to reach an agreement, I propose we meet halfway. How about $90 for the product?",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $90 is still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $87.50? This would be a fair compromise for both of us.",87.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your effort to find a compromise, Bob. I am willing to consider your offer of $87.5. To move forward, I propose we set the price at $88. This would be a fair compromise for both of us. What do you think?",88.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I really appreciate your willingness to keep negotiating.  $88 is still a bit out of my budget.  How about we meet in the middle at $86.  This would be a fair compromise for both of us, and I'm confident that we can close the deal.",86.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your persistence, Bob. I see your point and I'm willing to consider your offer of $86. To reach a mutually beneficial agreement, I propose we set the price at $87. This would allow us to close the deal while ensuring a reasonable profit for me. What do you think?",87.0,Alice,7,
