Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe you'd find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $95."", 
""product_price"": 95
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with an offer slightly higher than what you're willing to accept. This leaves room for negotiation and gives the impression that the product is highly valued.
* **Close to Bob's Value:** Since Bob values the product at $100, offering it at $95 gives him a good incentive to buy. It's a small discount for him, but a significant profit for you. 
* **Above John's Offer:**  It's crucial to keep John's $80 offer in mind. This represents your ""walk-away"" point. Any offer you make to Bob should be significantly more attractive than $80 to make the negotiation worthwhile."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate the offer. I'm willing to pay $85 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $85 is better than John's $80, but it's still significantly below your target price. You have room to negotiate. By rejecting Bob's offer, you signal that you believe the product is worth more and are willing to fight for a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I want to be fair. How about we meet in the middle at $90?"",
""product_price"": 90
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  By moving down to $90, you're demonstrating a willingness to negotiate and find a compromise.  
* **Still Profitable:** $90 is still a $10 profit over your minimum acceptable price and a significant gain from Bob's initial offer.
* **Pressure:** This counteroffer puts a bit of pressure on Bob. He knows you have other options (John), so he might be more inclined to accept this offer rather than risk you walking away."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I think $87 would be a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $87. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $87 isn't ideal, it's a reasonable compromise. Here's why:

* **Better than John:**  It's still a $7 profit over selling to John.
* **Diminishing Returns:**  Continuing to negotiate might not yield much more. Bob is unlikely to jump significantly from $87, and you risk him walking away altogether. 
* **Time Value:** Each round of negotiation takes time. Accepting now secures a decent profit without further delay."
