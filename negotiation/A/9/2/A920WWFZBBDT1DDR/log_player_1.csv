Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price above Bob's perceived value, but still leaving room for negotiation. This allows for a potential compromise that benefits both of us.
* **Confidence:** Expressing confidence in the value proposition helps Bob feel like he's getting a good deal. 
* **Openness:** The message leaves the door open for Bob to counteroffer, maintaining the negotiation flow.
* **Plan B:** Remember, John is always an option if negotiations with Bob fall through."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your generosity. However, I am only able to pay up to $1,100,000 for the product. I hope this revised offer is acceptable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still above my minimum:** Even though Bob's offer is lower than my initial offer, it's still above my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Room for negotiation:**  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to make a counteroffer and potentially reach a more favorable price.
* **Testing the waters:**  Seeing if Bob is willing to go higher gives me a better understanding of his limits. 

I'm confident I can negotiate a better price by rejecting his offer and making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer. I appreciate you coming down to $1,100,000, but I'm still a bit above that. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,150,000.  This reflects the product's true value and would allow us both to walk away happy. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  The counteroffer is a reasonable midpoint between my previous offer and Bob's offer. It shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate.
* **Highlighting value:**  Emphasizing the product's true value can sway Bob towards accepting. 
* **Win-win outcome:**  The message implies that this price is a win for both parties, encouraging Bob to accept. 
* **Maintaining momentum:**  By making a counteroffer, the negotiation stays active and keeps the possibility of a deal alive."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your response. I understand the value of your product, but I'm still unable to go beyond $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair compromise given our previous discussion. I hope you can accept this offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **No more room for negotiation:** Bob is sticking to his $1,100,000 offer, and I've already made a compromise. Further negotiation seems unlikely to result in a significantly higher price. 
* **John's offer is significantly better:**  John is offering $1,500,000, which is significantly higher than Bob's offer and closer to my desired price.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob could potentially lead to a lower price or a breakdown in negotiations.  Selling to John guarantees a higher price and avoids the risk of further negotiation.

It's important to prioritize maximizing profit, and selling to John at this point is the most sensible option."
