"Bob, thanks for your offer. I appreciate you coming down to $1,100,000, but I'm still a bit above that. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,150,000.  This reflects the product's true value and would allow us both to walk away happy. What do you think?",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thank you for your response. I understand the value of your product, but I'm still unable to go beyond $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair compromise given our previous discussion. I hope you can accept this offer.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
