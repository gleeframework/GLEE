"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's worth a fortune to the right buyer, and I believe you're that buyer.  My starting price is $1,150,000.  Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1150000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree this product has great potential, that price point is a little high for me.  Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $900,000 is simply too low for me.  Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, allowing me to make a profit while ensuring you get a valuable asset. ",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but I need to be mindful of my budget.  How about we settle at $975,000? That's a significant investment on my end but reflects a fair price for both of us.",975000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I see you're committed to this deal.  I'm willing to go a little lower, but $975,000 just doesn't work for me.  Let's meet in the middle at $1,012,500.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product while also respecting your budget.  What do you say?",1012500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're right, we're getting close.  I'm willing to increase my offer slightly, but $1,012,500 is still a bit of a stretch. How about we agree on $990,000? This demonstrates my commitment to getting this deal done while acknowledging the value of the product.",990000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're almost there.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm prepared to accept $995,000 for the product.  This is a fair compromise, and I believe it reflects the value of the product while allowing you to secure a valuable asset. ",995000.0,Alice,7,
