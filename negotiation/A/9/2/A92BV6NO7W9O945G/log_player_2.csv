"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique product that I believe could be of great value to you. While I can't disclose specifics just yet, I'm confident it's worth at least $1000000 to me. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1500000. This is a significant opportunity, and I believe the value proposition will be clear once you see it.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is exactly your maximum budget. There's no potential for saving money by accepting it. Since you can get the same product from John for the same price, it makes sense to reject Alice's offer and keep your options open. You might be able to negotiate with John or find an even better deal later."
