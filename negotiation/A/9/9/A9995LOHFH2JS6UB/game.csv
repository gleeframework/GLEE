"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's start with a price of $1400000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a great deal.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1300000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1350000. I believe this is a fair price that balances our interests.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $1325000. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to meet a minimum threshold to make this deal worthwhile. I'm counteroffering at $1375000. This is my final concession, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1375000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're not getting closer to a deal, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to be confident that we're at a fair price. I'm counteroffering at $1375000 again, but this time I'm willing to throw in some additional perks and support to sweeten the deal. I'm hoping this will be the final concession I need to make.",1375000.0,Alice,7,

"I'm not willing to go any lower than I already have, Bob. I've made significant concessions and added value to the deal with the perks and support. I'm afraid I need to prioritize my own interests and the minimum price I need to make this deal worthwhile. I'm counteroffering at $1375000 one last time. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to explore other options.",1375000.0,Alice,9,
