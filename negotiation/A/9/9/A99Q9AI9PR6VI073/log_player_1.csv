"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll be interested in. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to let it go for $125. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 125}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** $125 is more than your minimum of $100.
* **It's below Bob's value:** $125 is less than Bob's value of $150, giving him incentive to buy.
* **It's a reasonable starting point:** This gives Bob some room to negotiate while still allowing you to make a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $110. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $110 is better than selling to John, it's still significantly lower than my initial offer and my desired profit margin. By rejecting Bob's offer, I can try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $110 is just a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little more, but how about $115? That's a fair price considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 115}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, but I'm still a bit hesitant. How about $112? I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $112. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $112
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While I'd prefer a higher price, $112 is a good deal for me considering:

* **It's above my minimum:** $112 is significantly higher than my minimum selling price of $100.
* **It's close to my previous offer:** Bob is willing to pay almost my last offer, which shows he's interested.
* **We're nearing the end of the negotiation:** With only 6 rounds remaining, it's a risk to keep negotiating for a small price increase.

Accepting Bob's offer ensures a decent profit and avoids the risk of further negotiation or losing the deal entirely."
