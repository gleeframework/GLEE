Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000.  It's a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a good profit as well.  Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a good balance between maximizing my profit and keeping Bob potentially interested.  Here's why:

* **My Profit:**  $10,000 is still a significant profit for me, even though it's less than my ideal price.
* **Bob's Value:** This price is still lower than the value of the product for Bob, making it a potential bargain for him.
* **Alternative Buyer:**  I'm confident I can still sell to John for $15,000 if Bob declines, so I'm not taking a huge risk. 

It's important to be strategic and consider both the value of the product to the buyer and my own desired profit margin."
