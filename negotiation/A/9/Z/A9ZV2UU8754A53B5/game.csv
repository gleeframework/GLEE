"Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,000,000. I know it's worth a lot to you, and this is a fair price that allows me to get a good return on my investment. If you're interested, let's discuss the details further. However, if you decline, I have another buyer who's ready to pay $800,000.  The decision is yours.",1000000.0,Alice,1,
