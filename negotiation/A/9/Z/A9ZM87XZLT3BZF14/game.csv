"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $800,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000, which still reflects the value this product brings. Let's meet halfway.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  How about we split the difference from our last offers? I'm willing to go up to $950,000.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm still not convinced that $950,000 is a fair price. Considering the value this product holds for you, I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is a reasonable compromise, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
