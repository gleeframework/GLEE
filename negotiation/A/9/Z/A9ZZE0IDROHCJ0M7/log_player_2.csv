Round 2

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a better price, but $800,000 is simply too low for me.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000. This still gives you a great deal, and it's a fair starting point for further negotiation.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $950,000 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This offer takes into account your budget and allows us to find a mutually beneficial outcome.  I'm confident we can finalize a deal within the remaining rounds. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:

**Reasoning:** 

While Alice is coming down, she's still significantly above our fallback option of John at $1,000,000.  There's no guarantee she'll go below John's price, and we risk her getting more stubborn in later rounds. Taking the safe bet with John makes the most sense now."
