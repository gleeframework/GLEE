"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd be interested in. It's a great deal for you at just $12,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value to leave room for negotiation, but still significantly lower than my minimum desired price. This allows me to gauge Bob's interest while staying flexible."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $9,000 is closer to my minimum desired price, I believe there's still room for negotiation and I can likely secure a higher price. I'll counter with a slightly lower price in the next round to see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $9,000 is tempting, I'm still hoping to get closer to my asking price.  Would you consider $10,500? It's a fair price for this amazing product, and I'm confident you'll be very happy with it."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

I'm offering $10,500, which is halfway between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer.  This shows I'm willing to compromise, but also that I believe the product is worth more than $9,000. I'm hoping this will encourage Bob to come closer to my price in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I really think $10,500 is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $10,250? That's the best I can do. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  While $10,250 is still below my ideal price, it's getting closer to my minimum desired price and represents a good deal for both of us.  There's a good chance that if I reject his offer, he may walk away or keep counteroffering at a lower price, potentially dragging the negotiation out further.  It's better to secure a good deal now than risk losing the sale completely."
