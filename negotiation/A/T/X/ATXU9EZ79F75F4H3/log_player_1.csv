Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $950,000.  I believe this to be a fair offer considering its worth. Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 950000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we have a guaranteed $1,000,000 offer from John, aiming higher with Bob could yield a better return. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** Starting at $950,000 leaves room for negotiation if Bob counters. It also emphasizes the product's high value.
* **Alternative Option:** By mentioning that this is an ""exclusive opportunity,"" we subtly remind Bob that he's not the only potential buyer, creating a sense of urgency. 
 
**Important Note:** This strategy assumes we have no information about Bob's negotiation tactics or risk tolerance. Depending on the situation and any additional information, the offer price could be adjusted."
