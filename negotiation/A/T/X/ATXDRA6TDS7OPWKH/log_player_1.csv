Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $200. I believe it's a fantastic deal, and I'm excited to see if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 200} 
 
**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally advisable to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This gives you room to negotiate down if necessary while still potentially securing a price significantly above your minimum. 
* **Gauging Interest:**  Bob's response to this initial high price will give you valuable information about his level of interest and potential budget. If he outright rejects it, you know you need to come down significantly. If he counters, you have a starting point for negotiation.
* **Alternative Option:**  You always have the option to walk away and sell to John for $150, so there's no risk of losing money in this initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but $200 is a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to pay $120 for it. Is that something you'd be willing to accept? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Above Bob's Value:** Bob offered $120, which is significantly above his perceived value of $80. This suggests there's room for negotiation.
* **Below Your Minimum:** Accepting $120 would mean selling for less than your minimum of $150.
* **John as Backup:** You have the security of selling to John for $150, so there's no need to rush into a deal with Bob below your desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""I appreciate your interest, Bob.  While I understand your budget, $120 is quite a bit lower than what I had in mind. Could you do $170? That feels like a fairer compromise."", ""product_price"": 170}

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** By countering with $170, you're moving closer to Bob's price but still staying significantly above your minimum and your fallback option of John's $150 offer. 
* **Justification:** Offering a reason for your counter-offer (""fairer compromise"") can help move the negotiation along more smoothly than simply stating a number.
* **Leaving Room:** This counter-offer still leaves room for further negotiation if Bob is unwilling to meet at $170."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $170 is still a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to pay $140 for the product. Is that something you'd be willing to accept? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Above Minimum:** Bob's offer of $140 is above your minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **Close to John's Offer:** While you could hold out for $150 from John, accepting $140 from Bob is a reasonable compromise. It saves you the potential hassle of further negotiation or waiting for another buyer. 
* **Time Value:** Sometimes a sale today is worth more than potentially waiting for a slightly higher offer later."
