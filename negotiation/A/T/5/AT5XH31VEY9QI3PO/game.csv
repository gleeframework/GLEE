"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's quite a high starting point.  I'm interested, but I'd need to see the price closer to $600,000 for it to make sense for me.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a better deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $600,000. Let's meet in the middle at $900,000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for this product.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but the gap is still too wide.  How about $700,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're getting closer, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to meet you at $850,000, but that's as low as I can go. I need to make a profit on this deal.",850000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However,  $850,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to offer you $750,000. This reflects my budget constraints and represents a fair deal for both of us.",750000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob, but I'm starting to feel like we're getting too close to the product's value to me. I'm willing to meet you at $820,000, but I'm not going any lower. This is my final offer for now.",820000.0,Alice,7,
