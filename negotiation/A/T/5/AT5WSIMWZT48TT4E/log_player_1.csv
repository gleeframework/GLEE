"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth a lot to me, so I'm asking for $10,000. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'd be willing to pay $8,500.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $8,500 is a decent offer, I'm still aiming for a higher price. I believe there's room for negotiation, and rejecting this offer allows me to counter and potentially get closer to my desired price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I need a bit more than $8,500 to let this product go. I'm willing to come down to $9,500. It's a fair price considering the value it holds for you. Let's close the deal!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need a bit more than $8,500, but $9,500 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $9,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product to me, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $9,000 is getting closer to my desired price point. I'm within $1,000 of my initial offer, and given that we're halfway through the rounds, it's a good time to accept and avoid risking a further decrease in price or losing the deal altogether."
