"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,750,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying.  I'm willing to offer you $1,450,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the value you place on it. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1450000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,450,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer. How about $1,600,000? This still reflects the product's value and provides us both with a good deal. Let's see if we can close this.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  While $1,600,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like, I'm willing to go up to $1,550,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us.",1550000.0,Bob,4,
