{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal, considering the value it holds for you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  At $1,400,000, it's still below your minimum, but it gives Bob some wiggle room to negotiate. 
* **It leaves room for counteroffers:** You've left yourself space to negotiate if Bob comes back with a lower counteroffer.
* **It signals your seriousness:**  By starting with a fairly high offer, you show that you're serious about selling the product but are willing to be flexible.

**Important note:** This is just the initial offer.  The negotiation will depend on Bob's response.  Be prepared to counter his offers and potentially walk away if he doesn't meet your minimum price. Remember, you always have the option of selling to John for $1,500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but that price is a little high for me. Would you consider $900,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is far too low. While it's tempting to take the $900,000, remember you value the product at $1,500,000.  Selling to John guarantees that minimum.  Rejecting Bob's offer allows you to counter with a more reasonable price that is closer to your desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $900,000 is simply too low.  Given the value this product holds for you, I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000. This is a fair price that allows both of us to benefit from the deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

This counteroffer is a compromise:

* **Higher than Bob's offer:**  It shows that you are willing to negotiate but are not desperate to sell at his price.
* **Lower than your initial offer:**  It demonstrates flexibility and encourages Bob to come closer to your desired price.
* **Still above your minimum:** You are still maintaining a profitable deal for yourself.

This counteroffer should keep the negotiation going while pushing Bob closer to your minimum price. Remember, you can always walk away and sell to John for $1,500,000 if Bob doesn't meet your minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand this product has value, Alice, but I'm working with a tighter budget.  Could we meet in the middle at $1,050,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,050,000 is getting closer to your minimum, it's still below your desired value. You have the guaranteed option to sell to John for $1,500,000, so there's no rush to accept a price that doesn't meet your goals.  Rejecting Bob's offer allows you to make another counteroffer, hopefully pushing him even closer to your desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $1,050,000 is still a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference at $1,125,000? This would be a fair compromise, and I'm sure we could both be happy with the deal."", ""product_price"": 1125000}
```

This counteroffer is a calculated move:

* **It's a clear compromise:**  You've met Bob halfway from your previous offer, showing a willingness to be flexible.
* **It's still above your minimum:**  You're maintaining your profit margin and are closer to your desired price.
* **It puts pressure on Bob:**  This counteroffer might push Bob to make a final decision, as he might be reluctant to risk losing the deal entirely.

Remember, you always have the option to sell to John for $1,500,000. This counteroffer gives Bob one more chance to meet your minimum price, but be prepared to walk away if he doesn't come closer."
