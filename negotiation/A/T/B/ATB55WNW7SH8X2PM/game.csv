"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I think $2,000,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to consider purchasing the product, but I can only go up to $1,400,000. I believe this price is more in line with my budget and the product's value to me.",1400000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective on the price.  While $2,000,000 represents its full value, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,700,000?",1700000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate Alice's willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit short of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,600,000, but that's as high as I can go. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1600000.0,Bob,4,
