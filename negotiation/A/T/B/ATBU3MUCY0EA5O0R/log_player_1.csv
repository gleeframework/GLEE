Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$1,500,000** is a reasonable starting point. It's higher than John's offer, giving Bob incentive to consider it.
* **There's no guarantee Bob will accept.** If he rejects, I'll still get $1,200,000 from John, so there's no risk. 
* **This approach allows me to potentially maximize my profit.** If Bob values the product higher than $1,500,000, I'll get a better price. If he doesn't, I'll still get my minimum desired value."
