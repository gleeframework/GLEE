"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,100,000. This is a competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere.

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm definitely interested in the product, but that price is a little high for me. Would you consider $850,000?",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $850,000 is a significant discount, but I'm still looking to get a good return on my investment. After reconsidering, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm proposing a new price of $950,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  While $950,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something more budget-friendly. How about $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob. However, I've already compromised quite a bit, and I'm getting close to my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll meet you at $920,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'll consider it a done deal. What do you think?",920000.0,Alice,5,
