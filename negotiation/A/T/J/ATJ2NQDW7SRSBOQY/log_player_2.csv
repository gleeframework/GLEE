"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a price of $925,000 is fair. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than John's, it's still higher than the product's worth to her.  Bob can reject the offer and still get the product from John, albeit at a higher price. This strategy ensures Bob gets the product while minimizing his losses."
