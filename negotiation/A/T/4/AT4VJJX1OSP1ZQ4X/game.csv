"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, $18,000 is quite steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $9,000 for it.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your response.  I understand your perspective, but $9,000 is significantly below its value. How about we meet in the middle at $14,000?",14000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  However, $14,000 is still more than I'm comfortable spending. Could we possibly settle around $11,000?",11000.0,Bob,4,
