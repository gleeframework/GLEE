"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I believe this product would be incredibly valuable to you, even more so than you might realize at first glance. I'm willing to offer it to you at a starting price of $1,300,000.  I'm confident that the value it brings will far exceed this price."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High (but not too high):**  I'm starting significantly higher than both my minimum and Bob's perceived value. This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest and flexibility. 
* **Framing Value:**  The message emphasizes the product's value to Bob, subtly anchoring the discussion around its benefits rather than just the price.
* **Confidence:** Projecting confidence in the product and the offered price can influence Bob's perception.

This strategy aims to:

* **Maximize potential profit:** There's a chance Bob might accept a high price, especially with the value framing.
* **Gain negotiation leverage:** Even if rejected, this offer sets a high anchor point for subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my interest in the product. After careful evaluation, I believe a fair price for the product should be around $950,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to his perceived value, it's still significantly below my minimum. I'm willing to negotiate, but not at the cost of a significant loss. By rejecting and countering, I can:

* **Demonstrate firmness:** Showing I'm not desperate to accept any offer below my threshold.
* **Guide the negotiation:**  I'll aim to steer the price closer to a point where both of us can find value. 

Selling to John at this point is tempting, but I believe there's still room to secure a better deal with Bob within the remaining rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you taking the time to consider my offer and for presenting yours. I understand your perspective on the value, however, the price you proposed doesn't reflect the true worth of this product and the impact it can have on your business.  Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering the unique advantages this product provides."", 
""product_price"": 1200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledging Bob:** I want to maintain a positive negotiation environment by acknowledging his offer and perspective. 
* **Firm but Flexible:**  While I lowered my price by $100,000, I am still significantly above Bob's offer, demonstrating that I'm willing to negotiate but won't be lowballed. 
* **Reiterating Value:** I'm subtly reminding Bob about the benefits of the product to justify the higher price. 

The goal is to:

* **Encourage a counter:**  This offer invites Bob to engage further and hopefully propose a price closer to my target.
* **Maintain a strong position:** I'm holding firm to a price point that, if accepted, would yield a substantial profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. Considering the value proposition and my budget constraints, I propose a price of $1,100,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is a significant jump from his previous offer and represents a substantial profit for me. While I could try to push for more in subsequent rounds, there's a risk that:

* **Bob might walk away:** He's clearly indicated his budget constraints, and pushing further could make him reconsider the deal altogether.
* **Negotiation fatigue:**  Prolonging the process could lead to frustration on both sides, potentially jeopardizing a mutually beneficial agreement. 

Taking the $1,100,000 now represents a good balance between maximizing profit and securing a deal with a motivated buyer."
