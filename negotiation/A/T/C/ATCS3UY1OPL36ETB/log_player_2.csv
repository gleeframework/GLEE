"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly.  Given its value, I'm asking for $19,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I already have significant interest from other potential buyers. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $19,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $19,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","Alice's offer is way too high! It's even more than what the product is worth to you. You should definitely reject her offer and go with your backup plan.
