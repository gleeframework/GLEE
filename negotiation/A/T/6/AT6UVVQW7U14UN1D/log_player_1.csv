Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  $12,000 is higher than $10,000, but it gives Bob some room to negotiate.
* **It's below your minimum:** $12,000 is still above your minimum of $15,000, allowing you to potentially earn more.
* **It signals a willingness to negotiate:** This price shows you're open to finding a mutually beneficial solution. 

Let's see what Bob says!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay.  I'm interested in the product, but my maximum budget is $10,000. Would you be willing to consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $10,000 is tempting, it's significantly below my minimum value of $15,000. I need to try and get closer to that number.  I'm going to counter Bob's offer and see if we can find a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, $10,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $11,000?  That would be a fair compromise for both of us."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $11,000 is still a bit outside my budget.  I'm really interested in your product, but I can't go above $10,000.  Is there any flexibility at all? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is firmly at $10,000, and I'm not willing to go that low. It's time to cut my losses and move on.  John is a guaranteed $15,000, which is much closer to my minimum value."
