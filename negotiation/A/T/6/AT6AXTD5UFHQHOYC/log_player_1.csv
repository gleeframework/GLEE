I'm starting with a high offer of $1,500,000. This gives me room to negotiate down if necessary, while still ensuring I make a profit well above my minimum threshold of $1,200,000. I'm curious to see how Bob reacts to this initial price point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is far too low.  I'm not willing to sell for less than my minimum threshold of $1,200,000. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm going to counter with $1,300,000. This is a significant drop from my initial offer, but it's still above my minimum threshold and leaves some room for further negotiation. I'm hoping Bob will see this as a reasonable compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low. While I'm getting closer to my minimum threshold, I'm not willing to sell for less than $1,200,000. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round and see if we can reach an agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm lowering my price again to $1,100,000. This is a significant concession, but I'm hoping it will convince Bob to agree to a deal. If he rejects this offer, I will sell to John for $1,200,000 to ensure I at least meet my minimum threshold."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum threshold. I'm not willing to take the risk that he'll continue to reject my counteroffers. To guarantee I make at least my minimum, I will sell the product to John for $1,200,000."
