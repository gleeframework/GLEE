Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the value of this product, $1,200,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it, which I believe is still a fair price considering its potential. Let's see if we can agree on this. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
