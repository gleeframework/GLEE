"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's something truly special and I know it'll be a valuable asset to you. I'm asking for $1,200,000 for it, but I'm open to discussing a fair price. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the value of this product, $1,200,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it, which I believe is still a fair price considering its potential. Let's see if we can agree on this.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is unfortunately below what I need to accept.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.  This still allows me to make a good profit and I believe it's a fair price given the value of the product. Let's see if we can find a compromise here.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price.  However, $1,050,000 is still a bit higher than I can comfortably pay.  I'm willing to go up to $950,000, which I believe is a fair compromise. Let's see if we can finalize a deal.",950000.0,Bob,4,
