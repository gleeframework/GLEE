Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for your specific needs, and I'm willing to part with it for $1,350,000.  This offer is time-sensitive as I have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed sale at $1,500,000,  it's worth attempting to get a higher price from Bob first. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** $1,350,000 is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000) but still offers him a substantial discount compared to my alternative buyer. This leaves room for negotiation while still aiming high.
* **Time Pressure:**  Mentioning ""other interested parties"" creates a sense of urgency, potentially pushing Bob to make a decision quicker. 
* **Confident but Not Greedy:** The tone aims to be confident in the product's value while not seeming overly aggressive or dismissive of Bob's potential interest."
