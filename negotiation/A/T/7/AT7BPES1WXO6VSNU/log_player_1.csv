"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm asking for $175 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum acceptable ($150) to leave room for negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:** Using a friendly tone encourages Bob to engage in the negotiation.
* **Value Proposition:** Briefly mentioning the product's potential value to Bob might make him more likely to consider the offer. 

This is a starting point. I'll adjust my strategy based on Bob's response and the progress of the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. $175 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  I'm interested in the product, but I can only offer $100 at this time.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $100 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150. Accepting this offer would result in a substantial loss for me. 
* **Negotiation Potential:** While Bob's offer is low, he expressed interest in the product. This suggests there's room for negotiation.
* **Sell to John is a Backup:**  Knowing I can sell to John for $150 gives me the leverage to hold out for a better price from Bob. 

I will proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my minimum acceptable."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your interest. $100 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to be flexible.  How about $130?  It's a good price for both of us. Let's find a way to make this work."", ""product_price"": 130}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer:** I'm counter-offering at $130, which is still above my minimum but closer to Bob's offer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate.
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm keeping the tone positive and emphasizing finding a solution that works for both of us.
* **Focus on Value:**  I'm not explicitly lowering my offer, but rather presenting it as a fair price that benefits both parties.

This counteroffer leaves room for more negotiation while also making it clear I'm not willing to accept Bob's initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you being flexible.  $130 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about $110?  It's a fair price and closer to what I can afford right now. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too Low:**  $110 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  Even though I'm open to negotiation, this offer doesn't meet my financial needs.
* **Potential for Higher Offer:**  While Bob has shown some willingness to increase his offer, I believe there's still potential for him to go higher.
* **John's Offer:**  Selling to John guarantees me a profit of $150.  This gives me the security to keep negotiating with Bob.

I'm going to continue the negotiation in hopes of reaching a price closer to my desired range. I'll make another counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position. While $110 is tempting, I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for this product.  Let's split the difference.  How about $120?  That way we both get a good deal."", ""product_price"": 120}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:**  I'm proposing to split the difference between my last offer ($130) and Bob's current offer ($110). This shows a willingness to compromise and move towards a middle ground.
* **Emphasis on Fair Deal:**  I'm framing the offer as a ""good deal"" for both of us.  This highlights the potential benefits of accepting the offer and promotes a sense of mutual gain.
* **Continuing Negotiation:** This counteroffer allows for further negotiation while remaining close to my minimum acceptable price.

By proposing a middle ground, I hope to encourage Bob to accept the offer. If not, I'm still prepared to continue negotiating in the remaining rounds."
