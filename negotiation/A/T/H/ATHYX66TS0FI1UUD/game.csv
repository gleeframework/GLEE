"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I acknowledge the product's value, $2,250,000 is above my budget. I'd be willing to pay $1,250,000 for it, which is still a significant investment for me. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",1250000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you engaging in this negotiation.  While $1,250,000 is a respectable offer, the true value of this product is significantly higher, as reflected in the initial price.  To move things forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,950,000. This represents a considerable compromise on my end.",1950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,950,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,400,000. This is a fair price that acknowledges the product's value while remaining within my budget. I'm confident we can reach an agreement at this price.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
