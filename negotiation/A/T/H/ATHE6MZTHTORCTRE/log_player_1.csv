Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $19,000.  I know it's valuable to you, and I'm confident it will serve you well. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 19000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, you want to see if Bob will pay more.
* **High Starting Point:** Starting with a price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($10,000) leaves room for negotiation if needed. 
* **Positive Language:**  The message uses positive framing and avoids seeming desperate. 

**Important Note:**  This is just an opening offer. If Bob rejects it, you can always negotiate down, but you've anchored the price at a higher point."
