{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe would be very valuable to you. It's a [briefly describe the product's benefits or unique aspects].  I'm offering it to you for $20,000.  Let me know if you're interested! "", ""product_price"": 20000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$20,000 offer:** This is a reasonable starting point, as it's higher than your guaranteed $15,000 from John but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Highlighting value:**  The message emphasizes the potential value to Bob without revealing your minimum price. 
* **Openness to negotiation:** The message implies flexibility and encourages Bob to engage in conversation. 

**Important Notes:**

* This is just a starting point. The best price will depend on your assessment of Bob's potential interest and your comfort level with risk.
* You can adjust the offer price and message based on your knowledge of Bob's situation and the product's specific features."
