Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this unique product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,300,000. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 1300000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Considering the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $850,000. Let's see if we can reach a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to negotiate, so how about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000?"", ""product_price"": 1100000}"

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $1,100,000 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm willing to go up to $950,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product to me, and I believe it's a good starting point for a mutually beneficial agreement.

You have three options:

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is moving closer to a reasonable price, the negotiations are progressing slowly. It's unlikely he'll reach the $1,000,000 mark I need. John offers a guaranteed $1,000,000, which represents the minimum acceptable value for me. It's time to cut my losses with Bob and secure the sure deal with John."
