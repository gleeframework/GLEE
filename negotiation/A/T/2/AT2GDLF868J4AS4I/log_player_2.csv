Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $18,000 is way above his maximum budget of $12,000. He should try to negotiate a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $12,000 is your budget, Bob. However, I have to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $16,000. Is this something you'd be willing to consider?

While $16,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his limit. Bob should try to negotiate further."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $16,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  How about $14,000? I'm really interested in this product, but that's my final offer."", ""product_price"": 14000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm still a bit short of my desired price. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'm counteroffering at $17,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for the value this product brings. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000.

Alice's offer of $17,000 is still above Bob's budget.  At this point, it's more advantageous for Bob to buy the product from John for $12,000, ensuring he stays within his budget."
