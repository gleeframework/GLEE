Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm initially proposing a price of $750,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering the potential benefits it holds for you.  What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 750000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** While we know Bob values the product at $800,000, starting slightly below this allows room for negotiation upwards.
* **Justification:** Highlighting the ""unique value proposition"" subtly implies the product is worth more without directly stating a higher value. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** By asking for Bob's thoughts, we encourage a dialogue and potential counter-offer.

**Important Note:** We want to secure a deal with Bob if possible, even if it's slightly below his maximum valuation. This is because selling to John guarantees $1,500,000, but there's a chance to earn even more from Bob."
