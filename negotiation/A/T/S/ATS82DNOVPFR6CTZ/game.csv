"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $14000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it. Let me know what you think!",14000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12500. I'm looking to save some money, and that's the most I'm willing to pay.",12500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $12500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $13500.  This reflects the true value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us.  What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $13500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $13000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",13000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate.  While $13000 is closer to my desired price, it's still a bit below what I need to make this deal work.  I'm willing to meet you in the middle once again and offer $13250.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us both to come to an agreement.  Let's close this deal!",13250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $13250 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $13000, but that's my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me at that price, I'll have to consider buying from John for $12000.",13000.0,Bob,6,
