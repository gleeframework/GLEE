Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $12500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $13500.  This reflects the true value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us.  What do you think?
