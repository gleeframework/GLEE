"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to acquire this unique product. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to let it go for $1,200,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you is $1,500,000. I'm open to negotiations, but I think this is a great starting point. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
