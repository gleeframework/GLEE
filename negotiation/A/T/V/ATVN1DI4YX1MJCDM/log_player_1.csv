Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I believe this product would be incredibly valuable to you, potentially saving you significant time and resources. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,900,000.  This is a unique opportunity to acquire something truly transformative."",
""product_price"": 1900000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Stakes:**  The product has a high floor price ($1,000,000).  It's worth aiming high initially.
* **Value Emphasis:** The message focuses on the product's value to Bob, potentially justifying a price higher than his perceived value. 
* **Scarcity Implication:**  Mentioning a ""unique opportunity"" subtly implies scarcity, potentially making Bob more agreeable to a higher price.
* **Negotiation Room:** This offer leaves room for negotiation if Bob counters. It also ensures a substantial profit even if he negotiates down significantly.

**Important:** This is a starting point. Observing Bob's reaction to this initial offer will provide valuable information to adjust the price in subsequent negotiations, if necessary."
