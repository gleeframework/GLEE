"Hello Bob, I'm offering you a unique opportunity to purchase [Product name/description]. It's a valuable asset with a lot of potential.  My initial offer is $1800000. I'm confident this price reflects the true value of the product.  Let me know what you think.",1800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1400000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value of similar products. Let me know what you think.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I understand your perspective, $1400000 doesn't quite reflect the true worth of this product.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1600000.  This price still allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's find a compromise that works for both of us.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for considering my previous offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price. However, $1600000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1520000. I think this is a fair compromise that still reflects the value of the product. Let me know what you think.",1520000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to see we're getting closer.  $1520000 is still a little below what I'm comfortable with.  How about we split the difference and agree on $1560000?  It's a fair price that acknowledges the value of the product and allows us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",1560000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1560000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1540000, but I think that's the maximum I can go. I'm hoping we can find a way to meet in the middle and come to an agreement. Let me know what you think.",1540000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I understand your position.  $1540000 is still a little low for me, but I'm willing to make a final concession. Let's settle on $1550000. This is my final offer, and it reflects a fair compromise.  Let me know your decision.",1550000.0,Alice,7,
