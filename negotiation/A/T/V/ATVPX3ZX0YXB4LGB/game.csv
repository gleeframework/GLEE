"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a fair offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $18,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $12,000. I'm confident you'll love it, and I'm willing to make a compromise. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $18,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $10,000.  What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer of $10,000. I appreciate your interest in the product, and I'm willing to make a counteroffer. After considering your proposal, I'm thinking of selling it to you for $14,000. This is a compromise between our initial offers, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the counter offer. While $14,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit above my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $12,000? That seems like a fair deal to me.",12000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $12,000 is a significant compromise, but I'm still not willing to go that low. Considering the product's value to me is $15,000, I'm willing to make another counteroffer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $13,500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,5,
