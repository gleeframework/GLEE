Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but I'm still confident this product is worth more than $850000.  It has the potential to generate significant returns for you, far exceeding the initial investment. To show my commitment to finding common ground, I'm willing to come down to $900000.  Let's meet in the middle and make this deal happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming for a lower price. While Alice has lowered her offer to $900,000, it's still above Bob's desired price point.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue negotiating and potentially get closer to his target of $850,000."
