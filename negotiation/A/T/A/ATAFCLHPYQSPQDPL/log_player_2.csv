Alice is clearly willing to negotiate, but we're still above our ideal price. Let's see if we can push them down a bit further."

We've come a long way from the initial offer, and Alice is clearly getting closer to our desired price.  While we could continue negotiating, it's likely that Alice won't budge much further.  $8,150 is a good deal, and it's time to close the deal before we risk losing the opportunity or running out of rounds."
