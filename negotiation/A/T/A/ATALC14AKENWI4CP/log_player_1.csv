Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $115."", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price closer to Bob's perceived value ($120) to aim for a higher profit. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The $115 offer leaves space for Bob to potentially counter-offer, while still ensuring I'm well above my minimum acceptable price ($100).
* **Not Too Aggressive:**  While I want to maximize profit,  an overly aggressive initial offer (close to $120) might discourage Bob from further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am looking to stay within my budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is my absolute minimum acceptable price. While I could accept it and close the deal, there's still room for negotiation. I'll counter-offer in hopes of securing a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand your budget concerns. While I value this product highly, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $107.50?"", ""product_price"": 107.50}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** By suggesting we ""meet halfway"", I'm demonstrating a willingness to negotiate while still pushing for a price above Bob's offer.
* **Specific Number:** The very specific price of $107.50 might make it seem like I've carefully considered the value and am making a firm but fair counter-offer.
* **Maintaining Profit:** This counter-offer still ensures I make a profit above my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Could we possibly reach an agreement at $105? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is clearly trying to stay within a budget, and while I could push for a bit more, $105 is a reasonable profit above my minimum. Accepting this offer avoids the risk of Bob walking away if I counter-offer again."
