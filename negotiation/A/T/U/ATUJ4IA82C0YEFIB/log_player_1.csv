Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you at a price of $1,300,000."", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,500,000.
* **Your Minimum:** You need at least $800,000.
* **Maximizing Profit:**  There's a potential profit margin of $700,000 (Bob's valuation - your minimum). Aiming for a price around $1,300,000 allows you to capture a significant portion of that margin while still leaving Bob with a perceived gain. 

This strategy balances profit maximization with the risk of Bob rejecting the offer."
