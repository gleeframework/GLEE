"I appreciate your time and effort, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. Can you meet me at that price?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your interest. However, $12,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $12,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think?",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down, Alice, but $12,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $12,250. Can you consider that?",12250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating with you.  $12,250 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. How about $12,375? This price is a fair reflection of the product's value and allows us both to reach an agreement. Let me know what you think.",12375.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to meet you at $12,250, but I'd like to throw in a condition: I'd like you to throw in some free maintenance and support for the product for the first year. If you're willing to do that, I'd be happy to meet you at $12,250. What do you think?",12250.0,Bob,6,
