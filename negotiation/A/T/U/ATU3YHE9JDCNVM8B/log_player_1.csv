Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $14,000. I think it's a fair price considering its value. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed sale at $15,000 to John, it's worth trying to get a higher price from Bob first.
* **Reasonable Offer:** Offering the product at $14,000 is a significant markup from Bob's perceived value ($12,000) but still potentially attractive compared to him not getting the product at all. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $14,000 leaves a little wiggle room in case Bob tries to negotiate down slightly. You can always counter his offer or accept a slightly lower price (but no lower than $15,000) if it means securing the sale with Bob."
