Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}

Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}

Bob is going to try to meet Alice halfway. $9,500 is a compromise between his previous offer and Alice's latest one, and it's a clear indication that he's serious about buying the product but wants a fair deal."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Alice is getting closer to Bob's limit, he's still motivated to get the best price possible.  He's not quite willing to pay $10,500 yet and will try to counteroffer one more time before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

Bob is making his final counteroffer. This is his absolute limit, and he's hoping Alice will accept to avoid having to buy from John."

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob has reached his limit and is willing to pay a slight premium to secure the product from Alice.  While John's offer is still an option, Alice has come down to a price that's only slightly higher, making her deal more attractive.  This avoids further negotiation and ensures Bob gets the product."
