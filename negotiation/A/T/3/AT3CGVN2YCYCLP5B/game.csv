"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,150,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",1150000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $1,150,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $1,250,000?  This is still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit. What do you think?",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $1,250,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,200,000, which is the price I was initially looking for. This is my final offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
