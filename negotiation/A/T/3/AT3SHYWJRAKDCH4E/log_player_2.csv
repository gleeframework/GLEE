Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you taking the time to consider my initial offer and for coming back with a proposal. I understand your perspective on the price. To be frank, $800,000 is quite a bit lower than I can consider. Let's find a middle ground - how about $1,300,000?
