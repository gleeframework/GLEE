"Bob, it's great to connect with you about this. This product represents a unique opportunity, and I'm confident it can be immensely valuable for someone with your insights. I'm initially offering it at $1,500,000.  I believe that price reflects its true potential.",1500000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree this product has potential, the price point you've presented is a bit high for my budget. I'd be willing to consider a price closer to $800,000.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you taking the time to consider my initial offer and for coming back with a proposal. I understand your perspective on the price. To be frank, $800,000 is quite a bit lower than I can consider. Let's find a middle ground - how about $1,300,000?",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. That said, $1,300,000 is still a significant stretch.  To move this forward, I could offer $950,000. This reflects a serious investment on my part, and I believe it's a fair price considering the potential we've discussed.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I respect that.  $950,000 is closer, but it's still a significant gap from where I see the value. I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000.  I believe this price point represents a fair deal for both of us, given the product's potential.",1150000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,025,000, but that's really the limit of what I can justify. Let's close this deal.",1025000.0,Bob,6,
