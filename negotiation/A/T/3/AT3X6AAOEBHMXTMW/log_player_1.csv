"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really appreciate it.  I'm offering it to you for $145.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 145}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's slightly above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.  I want to see if he's willing to pay a little extra for the product.  If he rejects, I can adjust my price down in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $130. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $130 is better than nothing, I'm still holding out for a higher price. I'm hoping that by rejecting his offer, I can push him closer to my desired price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  While $130 is tempting, I'm still hoping to get a little closer to my asking price.  How about $135?  I think it's a fair compromise, and it allows us both to get a good deal."", ""product_price"": 135}
``` 

I'm offering a counteroffer at $135, which is halfway between my previous price and Bob's offer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but still aiming for a price closer to my desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're looking to get closer to your asking price, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $130. How about we meet in the middle at $132.50? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $132.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $132.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While I'd ideally like to get closer to my initial asking price,  $132.5 is a decent compromise and significantly higher than what Bob initially offered.  The risk of further negotiation is that Bob might walk away entirely, and I'd be forced to sell to John at a lower profit.  It's better to secure a good deal now than risk losing it altogether."
