"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

I will reject Bob's offer.  While $9,500 is better than nothing, I believe I can get closer to my desired price of $15,000.  I'm willing to negotiate further."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,500 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 11000}

Round 4

I'm still hoping to get closer to my goal of $15,000. While $10,200 is tempting, I'm going to see if I can get Bob to budge a bit more."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your financial constraints, but $10,200 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,700.

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While we are getting closer, I'm still hoping to get a price closer to $11,000.  I'm not ready to sell to John just yet, as I believe I can still get a better price from Bob."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

This is a good opportunity for me to close the deal. I've already rejected Bob's offer several times and we're getting closer to my target price. I'm comfortable with this offer and don't want to risk losing the deal to John.  I'm going to accept Bob's offer of $10,500."
