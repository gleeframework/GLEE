Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $10,000. This is a good starting point. It's a fair price considering the product is worth $12,000 to me and $8,000 to him. This leaves room for negotiation but also ensures I don't undervalue the product too early."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While $9,000 is closer to my desired price, I believe I can still get a bit more. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

I'm counteroffering at $9,500. This is a compromise that shows I'm willing to negotiate, but it still leaves some room for profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  While I'd prefer a bit more,  $9,200 is still a good price considering my minimum acceptable price and the possibility of further negotiation. Selling to John for $12,000 is tempting, but it's not a significant enough increase to warrant risking further negotiations with Bob."
