Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below what it's worth to you and gives me a good profit. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $8500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and pay a bit more than what you think the product is worth to you. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I will reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price. While $8,500 is better than $8,000, I can still aim for a better deal.  I'll see if I can get closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your interest, but I need to get a bit closer to my desired price point. I'm willing to meet you halfway and come down to $9,250. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you. Let's make this deal happen!"", ""product_price"": 9250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that you're trying to get closer to your desired price point, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $9000. I think this is a fair price considering the value of the product to me. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I would ideally like to get closer to my desired price point, Bob's offer of $9,000 is a good deal. It's a substantial increase from his previous offer and closer to my expectations.  It's also important to consider that we're nearing the halfway point of our negotiations, and I don't want to risk losing the deal by being too stubborn."
