"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this item for sale at $110. I think you'll find it's a great deal for something of this quality. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $110 is better than $120, you can potentially get a better deal by negotiating with Alice.  You have room to offer a lower price and still get the product for less than your maximum value of $120."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice,  $110 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $95 for the product. Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we meet in the middle at $105? That's a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $105 is a good deal for you.  It's still less than your maximum price of $120 and likely a fair price for both of you.  It's not worth risking further negotiation as it could lead to a stalemate, forcing you to buy from John at a higher price."
