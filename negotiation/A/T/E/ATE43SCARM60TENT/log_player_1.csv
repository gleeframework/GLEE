Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, that price is a little high for me. Would you consider $1,100,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you countering. However, $1,100,000 significantly undervalues the product's worth and potential.  I'm willing to meet you halfway from our previous positions. How about $1,275,000?"",

Round 4
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000

``` 

**Reasoning:** While Bob's offer now matches John's standing offer, we still have room to negotiate and Bob clearly sees value in the product. It's worth risking another round to try and secure a slightly higher price from Bob."
