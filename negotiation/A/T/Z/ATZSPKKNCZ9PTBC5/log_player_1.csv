Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. I know it's worth a lot to you, and this price reflects that. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This is a starting point. I'm aiming for a high price, but also leaving room for negotiation.  If Bob rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand the value of your product, but I am only able to pay up to $9,500. I hope this revised offer works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $9,500 is a good offer, I'm still confident I can get closer to my target price of $10,000. I'll counter Bob's offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping to get closer to my initial price. Would you be willing to go up to $9,750? This would be a fair compromise for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9750} 
```

I'm increasing my offer by a smaller amount this time to show flexibility and encourage Bob to meet me halfway. I'm still confident that I can get a higher price than John's offer of $8,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. After careful consideration, I can offer $9,600 for the product. I hope this proposal is acceptable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,600
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to $9,750, I'm confident that $9,600 is a fair price. It's a significant improvement over John's offer, and it seems like Bob is firm on his position.  I'll accept this offer and move on."
