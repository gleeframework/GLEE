Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $14,000. I believe it holds significant value that could benefit you. Let me know what you think!"", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($15,000) as possible without losing him as a buyer.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering $14,000 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially negotiate a slightly higher price if he's inclined, further maximizing your profit.
* **Secure a Good Deal:** Even if Bob rejects this offer, you have a guaranteed sale to John for $12,000, ensuring you don't lose money."
