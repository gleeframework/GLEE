"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13000. I know it's worth a lot to you, but this is a fair price considering its value to me.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $13,000 is a better price than $15,000, there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $13,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $11,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 11000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $12000, but that's really the lowest I can go.  Let's see if we can make this work. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's ideal price.**  $12,000 is still a good deal for Bob, as it's below his maximum budget of $15,000.
* **Further negotiation might not be worth the effort.** There's a risk that Alice might not budge further, and Bob could end up paying the full $15,000 from John. 

Accepting Alice's offer is the safest and most financially advantageous option at this point."
