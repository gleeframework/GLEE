Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at the special price of $145. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", ""product_price"": 145}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations a little higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer. 
* **Close to Bob's Value:** While you want to maximize profit, setting the price too close to $150 might discourage Bob. Offering it slightly above his perceived value ($120) increases the chances of a sale.
* **Limited Time Offer:** Creating a sense of urgency can nudge Bob to make a decision faster.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing your potential profit and increasing the likelihood of Bob accepting your offer."
