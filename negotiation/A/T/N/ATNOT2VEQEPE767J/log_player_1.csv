Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product for $1,199,999. I believe it offers immense value, and this price reflects its worth in the market."", 
""product_price"": 1199999
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:** Our goal is to get as close to $1,200,000 (our guaranteed sale price to John) as possible. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While the initial offer is high, it leaves a small window for Bob to negotiate down slightly, potentially still landing above $1,200,000.
* **Creating a Sense of Value:**  By positioning the price near John's valuation, we emphasize the product's worth, potentially making Bob more inclined to accept a higher price.

**Important Note:**  This is just one strategy. There's always a risk Bob might reject the offer.  A slightly lower offer would increase the chance of Bob accepting but potentially leave money on the table."
