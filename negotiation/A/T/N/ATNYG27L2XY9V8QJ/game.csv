,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $120 is a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $75 for the product. What do you think?",75.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I'm afraid $75 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $100. Let me know if that works for you!",100.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $100 is still a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $85.  Let's try to close this deal.",85.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer! However, I still think $85 is a bit short of what I'm looking for. I'm willing to meet you at $95, but that's as low as I can go. Let me know if that works for you!",95.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $95 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $90.  Let's see if we can close the deal on this.",90.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we might not meet in the middle. I'm willing to compromise again, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm offering it to you for $92. That's the lowest I can go, so let me know if that works for you!",92.0,Alice,7,
