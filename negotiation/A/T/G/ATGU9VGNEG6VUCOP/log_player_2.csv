"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I believe will be valuable to you. I'm offering it to you for $10,000. It's a great deal considering its value to me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's starting offer is too high. It's closer to her value than mine. I'll try to negotiate a better price before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $6,000?"",
""product_price"": 6000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** I'm starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's opening offer. This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to gauge her willingness to come down on the price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $6,000 is simply too low. How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $8,000.  This is a fair price that allows both of us to benefit from the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice met my ideal price. There's no point in negotiating further or buying from John, as they both offer the same price now."
