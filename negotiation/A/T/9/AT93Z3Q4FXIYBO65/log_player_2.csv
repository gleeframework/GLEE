"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, it's a pleasure to connect with you. I'm offering you a fantastic opportunity to acquire this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this represents a fair starting point for negotiations.

{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value of the product,  $1,100,000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it.  This is my best offer, and I believe it's a fair price given my budget and the product's potential."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $850,000 is significantly below its true value and what I'm willing to accept.  To move this forward, I'm proposing $1,050,000. I believe this reflects a more accurate valuation while acknowledging your interest.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $1,050,000 is still outside my budget. I'm firm on my previous offer of $850,000. If we can't reach an agreement, I'll unfortunately have to explore other options."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm sensing we're reaching a critical point in this negotiation. I'm willing to adjust my price to $1,000,000, but this is my absolute final offer. This represents a significant compromise on my end while ensuring the product's value is acknowledged.  I believe it's a fair deal, and I need a decision from you now to proceed. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's offer is still above my maximum budget.  It's time to cut my losses and buy from John.  Although I'd prefer to save even more,  it's better to secure the product now rather than risk further negotiation with Alice."
