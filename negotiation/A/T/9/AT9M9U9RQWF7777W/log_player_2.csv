**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is lower than the product's worth to her, it's still above Bob's maximum budget.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a better price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for the counteroffer.  I appreciate you taking the time to negotiate. I can come down a bit to $9,000.  This is still a great deal for you, and it's closer to what I need to get for the product.  Let me know if you're interested in moving forward.

**Explanation:**

Bob is still trying to get the best possible deal.  While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above Bob's desired budget.  Rejecting the offer gives Bob another chance to negotiate a lower price."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm still a bit high at $9,000. I'm willing to pay $8,750. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm hoping you'll consider it."", ""product_price"": 8750}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $8,750 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,250? This would be a fair price for both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:

```

**Explanation:**

Bob has reached his limit.  While Alice has come down a bit, the price is still higher than what Bob is willing to pay.  At this point, it's more advantageous for Bob to purchase the product from John for $8,000, as it guarantees the lowest price and avoids further negotiation."
