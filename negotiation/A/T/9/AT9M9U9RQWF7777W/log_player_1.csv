{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500.  It's a great deal and I think it's worth your consideration. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer starts with a price that's higher than Bob's valuation, but still leaves room for negotiation.  It also establishes a friendly tone and encourages Bob to engage with the offer.  If Bob rejects, I can then consider lowering the price slightly, but I'll keep in mind that John is willing to pay $10,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $9,500 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While $8,500 is better than nothing, it's still far below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. I'll counter with a slightly lower price, hoping to meet somewhere in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the counteroffer.  I appreciate you taking the time to negotiate. I can come down a bit to $9,000.  This is still a great deal for you, and it's closer to what I need to get for the product.  Let me know if you're interested in moving forward."", ""product_price"": 9000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm still a bit high at $9,000. I'm willing to pay $8,750. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm hoping you'll consider it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

```

While $8,750 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not happy with that price. I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price with another counteroffer."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $8,750 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,250? This would be a fair price for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9250}
