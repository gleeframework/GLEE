"Bob, thanks for the counteroffer.  I appreciate you taking the time to negotiate. I can come down a bit to $9,000.  This is still a great deal for you, and it's closer to what I need to get for the product.  Let me know if you're interested in moving forward.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm still a bit high at $9,000. I'm willing to pay $8,750. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm hoping you'll consider it.",8750.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $8,750 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,250? This would be a fair price for both of us. What do you think?",9250.0,Alice,5,
