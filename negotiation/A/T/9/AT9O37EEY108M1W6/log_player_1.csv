Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,900,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and the benefits it will bring you."", 
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $1,500,000, you can afford to start high with Bob. This leaves room for negotiation if needed, but also maximizes potential profit.
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes the product's ""value"" and ""potential,"" subtly justifying the high price without directly revealing your minimum.
* **Round number:**  Using a round number like $1,900,000 can make the offer seem more deliberate and less arbitrary.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's personality:** If you know Bob is particularly price-sensitive, you might want to adjust the offer slightly lower. However, starting high gives you more room to negotiate.
* **Market knowledge:** This strategy assumes you have some understanding of the market and believe $1,900,000 is within the realm of possibility."
