"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,400,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product.  It's a fair price that gives us both a good deal.  Let me know what you think.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $1,200,000 is simply too low for me. I'm prepared to come down to $1,300,000. This price still allows for a substantial profit for both of us. Let's find a way to make this work.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
