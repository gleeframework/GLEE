"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a great opportunity for you to invest in something that will bring significant value to your business. I'm willing to offer you the product for $12,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's worth to you is $8,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'm willing to offer $5,000. I believe this is a fair price considering it's a significant investment for me.",5000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to lower the price to $9,500. This is still a good value for the product, considering its worth to you is $8,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us.",9500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my budget.  However, $9,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I can do $6,500.  I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us.",6500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're still looking for a better price. I'm willing to make another concession. I'm willing to lower the price to $8,000. This is getting close to your original offer, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",8000.0,Alice,5,
