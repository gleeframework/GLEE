"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below its true market value.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,800. I'm willing to meet you halfway between your offer and the market value. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum acceptable price, I can likely do better.  There's still room to negotiate, and I want to maximize my profit. I'll counteroffer to see if we can land closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,800 is a bit low for me.  Let's compromise at $11,200. This still gives you a good deal and allows me to make a reasonable profit.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 11200}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $11,000, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me halfway on this one? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $11,000 is only $500 below my initial offer and is within a reasonable negotiation range.  Further negotiation might lead to a better price, but the risk of losing the deal entirely increases with each round. Accepting this offer secures a good profit and minimizes the risk of a no-sale."
