"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,800. I'm willing to meet you halfway between your offer and the market value. What do you think?",10800.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,800 is a bit low for me.  Let's compromise at $11,200. This still gives you a good deal and allows me to make a reasonable profit.  What do you say?",11200.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $11,000, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me halfway on this one?",11000.0,Bob,4,
