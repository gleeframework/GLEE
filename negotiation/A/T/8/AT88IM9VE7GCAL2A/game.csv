,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $1,000,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $1,100,000?  It's still a good value for you, and I'm confident you won't be disappointed with the product.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,050,000 is tempting, I'm still a little short of my target. Let's try $1,125,000.  It's a small increase from your last offer, but it helps me reach a price point I can work with.  What do you think?",1125000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest and understand your budgetary constraints. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,100,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it gets us closer to a deal. Let's make it happen.",1100000.0,Alice,7,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $1,075,000 for the product. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1075000.0,Bob,8,
