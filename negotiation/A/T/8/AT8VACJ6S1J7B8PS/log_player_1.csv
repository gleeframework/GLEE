Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd find valuable. I'm willing to offer it to you for $140. Let me know what you think!"", 
""product_price"": 140
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $150, you want to see if Bob will pay a price above your minimum.
* **Reasonable Markup:**  Offering the product at $140 is a reasonable markup from Bob's perceived value of $100. It gives him a potential deal while still securing you a good profit. 
* **Negotiation Room:** Starting at $140 leaves room for potential negotiation if Bob counters. You can then decide if you want to go slightly lower or stick to your minimum with John."
