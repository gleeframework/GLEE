"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product, but I believe we can reach an agreement closer to my budget. How about we set the product price at $1,400,000? I hope this proposal is acceptable.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is unfortunately below my minimum.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $1,550,000.  This is a fair price considering the product's value, and it gives us both a good deal.",1550000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your response, Alice. I appreciate the effort to find a middle ground. While $1,550,000 is a reasonable suggestion, I would like to propose a price of $1,525,000. I believe this offers a fair compromise for both of us. I look forward to your consideration.",1525000.0,Bob,4,
