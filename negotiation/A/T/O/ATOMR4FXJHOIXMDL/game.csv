"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as you've indicated it's worth that much to you. Let me know your thoughts.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my maximum budget and the value you place on it.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $900,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer.  How about $1,100,000? This price still leaves room for profit for both of us and allows for a smooth transaction. Let me know if you're interested.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000, which is my absolute maximum.  This price is fair considering both our positions and would allow us to close the deal quickly.  What do you say?",1000000.0,Bob,4,
