"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on something really valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $100. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

``` 
Alice's offer is higher than both your maximum price and Alice's value for the product. There's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested in the product, but $100 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider a lower price?"",
""product_price"": 70
}
```

This counter-offer achieves a few things:

* **Polite and interested:** It maintains a positive tone and expresses continued interest in the product.
* **Signals budget constraints:**  Without directly revealing your maximum price, it implies you're looking for a better deal. 
* **Aggressive but reasonable:** Starting at $70 is a significant drop from Alice's offer, but it leaves room for negotiation and is closer to Alice's perceived value of the product ($80)."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $100 might be a bit high for you, but I'm still willing to negotiate. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $90. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really appreciate the value it brings. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Alice is moving closer to a price you'd accept, $90 is still above your target. There's room to negotiate further and try to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down in price, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $80? I think that's a fair price for both of us."",
""product_price"": 80
}
```

Here's why this counteroffer makes sense:

* **Direct and Fair:** It proposes a specific price that addresses Alice's willingness to negotiate while being clear about your desired outcome. 
* **Appeals to Mutual Benefit:**  By positioning $80 as a ""fair price for both of us,"" it highlights the win-win scenario of this agreement.
* **Strategic Positioning:**  This offer matches Alice's perceived value of the product, increasing the likelihood of acceptance."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a fair price, and I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, I'm still not willing to sell it to you for $80. I'm willing to compromise a bit more and sell it to you for $85. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice has come down to $85, which is a reasonable price and within your $120 budget.  Continuing to negotiate for a smaller discount might push Alice away, risking the deal entirely. It's best to accept this offer and secure the product."
