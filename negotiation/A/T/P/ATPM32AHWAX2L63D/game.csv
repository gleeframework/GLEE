"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident it will be worth more than that to you in the long run. Let me know what you think!",10000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $10000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $8500 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, and I appreciate your offer. However, $8500 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to get closer to $10000 to make this work.  How about we split the difference and go with $9250? It's a fair price, and it gives us both a good deal.",9250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9250 is still a bit high for me.  I'm happy to meet you in the middle at $9000. This would give us both a good deal, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the value we're both placing on the product.",9000.0,Bob,4,
