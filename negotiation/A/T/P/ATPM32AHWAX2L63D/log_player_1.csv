Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident it will be worth more than that to you in the long run. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than Bob's perceived value:**  Bob values the product at $8,000, so he might be willing to pay a bit more.
* **It's lower than your minimum:** It gives you room to negotiate down if Bob makes a lower counteroffer.
* **It's a reasonable price:**  It's a good starting point for a negotiation, leaving room for both parties to find a mutually agreeable price.

**Important Note:** This is a strategic move. If Bob rejects this offer, you can always fall back on John who will pay your minimum of $12,000. However, by offering a slightly lower price to Bob, you increase the chances of a deal and potentially get a faster sale."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $10000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $8500 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $8,500 is better than nothing, it's still significantly less than your minimum value of $12,000. You've already established a higher starting point, so it's worth trying to get closer to your desired price. Rejecting Bob's offer allows you to counter with a higher price and potentially reach a more favorable deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, and I appreciate your offer. However, $8,500 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to get closer to $10,000 to make this work.  How about we split the difference and go with $9,250? It's a fair price, and it gives us both a good deal."", ""product_price"": 9250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9250 is still a bit high for me.  I'm happy to meet you in the middle at $9000. This would give us both a good deal, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the value we're both placing on the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $9,000 is a good compromise. It's higher than his initial offer and closer to your desired price.  While it's still below your minimum value of $12,000, accepting this offer ensures a sale and avoids the risk of further negotiations that might lead to a lower offer or a sale to John at $12,000."
