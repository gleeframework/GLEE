"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000.

"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $950,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to offer $850,000 for the product. This price reflects its value to me and allows for a reasonable profit for you.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $850,000. After reconsidering, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $900,000. This price still reflects the product's value to me, but I'm willing to compromise to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $875,000. Considering the product's value to me is $1,000,000, I'm willing to meet you at $925,000. This price is closer to my target, but I'm willing to make one more concession to finalize the deal.",925000.0,Alice,5,
