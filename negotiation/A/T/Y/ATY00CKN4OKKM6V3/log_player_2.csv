"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Goal:**  Save as much money as possible while still acquiring the product.
* **Alice's Offer:**  $9,000 is too high for Bob. It's more than half of Bob's maximum budget, and it leaves little room for negotiation. 
* **Next Steps:**  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to counteroffer and attempt to lower the price. There are still 9 rounds remaining, and Bob can always buy from John as a backup."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 7000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Strategy:**  Start with a strong counteroffer to signal that he's serious about getting a good deal.  $7,000 is significantly lower than Alice's offer, but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Why $7,000:** This price is still above Alice's minimum value for the product, giving her an incentive to negotiate. 
* **Next Steps:**  Bob hopes that Alice will accept his counteroffer.  If she rejects, Bob can continue to adjust his counteroffers strategically, keeping in mind his maximum budget and Alice's potential willingness to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's Offer:** $8,500 is within Bob's budget and a reasonable compromise. 
* **Bob's Goal:**  Save money, and this offer is significantly better than John's price.
* **Negotiation Progress:**  Alice has shown some flexibility, and continuing to reject might lead to a stalemate or even an increase in price.  
* **Risk/Reward:**  While Bob could try for a lower price, the risk of losing the deal entirely or needing to buy from John outweighs the potential gains."
