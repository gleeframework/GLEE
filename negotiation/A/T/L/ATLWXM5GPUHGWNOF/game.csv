"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $110. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. What do you say?",110.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $100?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, $100 is still a little low for me. I'm willing to come down to $105.  That's a fair price considering the value of the product to you.  Let me know what you think.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to make a profit, but I'm still not comfortable with $105. I'd be willing to meet you halfway between $90 and $105, which would be $97.50. Would you be willing to accept that price?",97.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $97.50 is still a little too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $101.25? I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product.",101.25,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting a bit frustrated with the back-and-forth, but I'm still interested in the product. I'd like to make a final offer of $95. I'm willing to walk away if you're not willing to meet me at this price.",95.0,Bob,6,
