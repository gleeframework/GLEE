"Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $120 is less than John's price, there's room for negotiation. Bob should aim to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to save as much money as possible. Offering $100 is a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer, and still leaves room for some potential negotiation. This price is also well below Bob's maximum budget of $150."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price to $110, which is still a good deal for Bob, as it's lower than his maximum budget of $150.  Further negotiation might get a slightly lower price, but the risk of Alice rejecting the counteroffer and Bob having to buy from John at a higher price outweighs the potential savings."
