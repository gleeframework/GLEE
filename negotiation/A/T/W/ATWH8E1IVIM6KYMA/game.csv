"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is out of my price range. I'm interested in this product, but I can only offer $750,000. Let's see if we can find common ground.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, and I'm willing to be flexible. However, $750,000 is simply too low for me. I'm confident this product will be incredibly valuable to you, and I'm prepared to come down to $850,000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's worth. Let's work together to find a solution.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $850,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm ready to offer $800,000, which is my absolute maximum.  I truly believe this product is worth it to me, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement at this price.",800000.0,Bob,4,
