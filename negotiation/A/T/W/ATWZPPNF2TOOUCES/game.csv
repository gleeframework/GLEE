"Bob, I believe this product has tremendous value for you, given its potential to generate significant returns. I'm offering it to you for $1,200,000. This price reflects a fair compromise between our respective needs.  Let me know what you think.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,200,000 is still a bit high for me. Given the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $950,000. This price is fair and allows for both of us to walk away with a good deal. What do you think?",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $950,000 is a bit low for me, considering the product's value. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This price still allows for a good profit for both of us.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
