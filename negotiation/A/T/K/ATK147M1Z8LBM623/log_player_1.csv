Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. I know it's a great deal for you, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting at $14,000, which is above Bob's perceived value but below my minimum acceptable price. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Building rapport:** The message emphasizes the value to Bob and shows a willingness to work with him. 
* **Option to walk away:** I remind Bob that I have another buyer (John) willing to pay my minimum price, putting pressure on him to accept a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I'm looking to save as much as possible. I'm willing to pay $13,500 for the product. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value is still below minimum:**  While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum price, it's still below my desired value. 
* **Potential for higher offer:** I believe there's room for further negotiation.  Bob is clearly motivated to purchase the product and may be willing to increase his offer slightly. 
* **Maintaining leverage:** Rejecting Bob's offer maintains my leverage and signals that I'm not desperate to sell at his price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your desire to get the best deal. While I'm willing to negotiate, $13,500 is still below my minimum.  Let's compromise at $13,750.  This price is fair for both of us and allows us to move forward with the transaction."", ""product_price"": 13750}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-offer with justification:** I'm counter-offering with a slightly higher price than Bob's offer but still below my minimum. I'm justifying this counteroffer by emphasizing the ""fairness"" and ""compromise"" aspect.
* **Keeping the negotiation moving:** This counter-offer keeps the negotiation moving forward without giving up too much. 
* **Showing flexibility:** By suggesting a compromise, I'm demonstrating my willingness to work with Bob while still protecting my own interests."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $13,500, and I think that's a fair price for both of us. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Negotiation stalemate:** Bob is unwilling to budge from his $13,500 offer, and I'm unwilling to go below my minimum of $14,000. 
* **Time is valuable:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob risks further delays and may not yield a significantly better outcome.
* **Guaranteed profit with John:** Selling to John guarantees me my minimum acceptable price and a quick, hassle-free transaction. 

While I would have preferred to get a higher price, the potential for further negotiation with Bob is limited, and the risk of a deal falling apart outweighs the potential gains.  Selling to John is the most sensible option at this point."
