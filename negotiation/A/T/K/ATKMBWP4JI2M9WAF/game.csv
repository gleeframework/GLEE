,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $1300000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. However, $900000 is significantly lower than what I need to consider. I'm willing to come down to $1100000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1100000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $950000. I really need to make a deal on this product, so I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price.",950000.0,Bob,4,
