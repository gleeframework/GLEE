* **Maximizing Profit:** You want to get as close to his valuation as possible without going over, leaving room for negotiation if needed.
* **Alternative Option:**  You have a guaranteed sale at $800,000, so your offer should be significantly higher than that. 

By offering the product at $925,000, you're aiming for a price that's highly profitable for you while still being attractive to Bob."
