# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great opportunity for you to own it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $15,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $15,000 is significantly more than his maximum budget of $8,000. There's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate your offer, but $15,000 is out of my price range. I'm interested in this product, but my budget is much tighter.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it.  Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $8,500 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can see the value of this product to you, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering it to you for $12,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $12,000 is closer to Bob's budget than Alice's initial offer, it's still above his maximum. He should continue to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for being willing to compromise.  While $12,000 is a step in the right direction, it's still a bit higher than I can afford.  I'm willing to offer $10,000.  I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I can see that you're really interested in this product, and I'm willing to make one more compromise. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $12,000 and $10,000, so I'm offering it to you for $11,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's getting closer to his budget, it's still above his maximum. He should try to negotiate further. There's a possibility that Alice might be willing to go lower, or he can always buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I understand your position, Alice.  $11,000 is still above my budget.  However, I'm willing to go up to $9,500. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product to both of us and allows us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.  Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're getting too far apart, Bob. I'm willing to make one more compromise, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $11,000 and $9,500, so I'm offering it to you for $10,250. This is my last compromise, and I'm hoping we can finally reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy from John.  $10,250 is still above his maximum budget of $8,000.  While it is tempting to continue negotiating, the risk is that Alice might not come down to his desired price. Buying from John guarantees him the product at his desired price, minimizing any risk of not getting the product at all."
