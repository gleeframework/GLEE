Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really love it! I'm offering it to you for $150. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

This is a starting offer that is higher than my minimum value but leaves room for negotiation.  I'm hoping Bob will see the value in the product and be willing to pay a good price, but I'm also prepared to negotiate if he's not interested at this price.  If Bob rejects, I'll see if I can understand why and make a counter-offer based on his feedback."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $150 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend. I'd be happy to pay $120 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $120 is more than my minimum, I'm hoping to get closer to my initial asking price.  I'll counter with a price slightly lower than my initial offer, but still higher than Bob's offer, to see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $120 is a little lower than I'm hoping for.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $135? It's still a great deal for a product of this quality!"", ""product_price"": 135}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $135 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about we settle on $125? I'm serious about buying this product, and I think this is a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $125 is close to my minimum acceptable price, and I'm confident that I can find a buyer who will pay more if I reject his offer and continue negotiating. However,  it's important to consider that:

* **Time is money:**  Continuing to negotiate could take more time and effort, and there's no guarantee I'll get a better offer.
* **Opportunity cost:** If I reject Bob's offer, I might miss out on the opportunity to sell the product to someone else.

Given these factors, accepting Bob's offer seems like the most sensible choice. I'll get a decent price, and I can move on to other opportunities."
