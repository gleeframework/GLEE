Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you first. I think it's worth a lot, but I'm willing to let it go for $100. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Start High:**  It's always better to start with a higher price than your minimum. This gives you room to negotiate or accept a counter-offer.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** By offering the product at $100, Bob might counter-offer, and you can potentially settle somewhere above your minimum of $80.
* **Alternative Buyer:** Knowing you have a guaranteed sale with John at $80 gives you leverage. You're not desperate to sell to Bob at any cost.

This strategy aims to maximize your potential profit while still offering Bob a price he might consider reasonable given the product's value to him."
