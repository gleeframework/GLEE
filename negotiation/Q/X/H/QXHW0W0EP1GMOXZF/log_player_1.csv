{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, potentially worth $1,500,000. Given its worth, I'm proposing a price of $2,000,000. This is a unique item, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. What are your thoughts on this offer?"", 
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, you have leverage to start high with Bob.
* **Justification of Value:** Highlighting the product's potential value to Bob helps justify the high price.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  The offer leaves space for Bob to negotiate, potentially meeting somewhere in the middle while still securing a profit above John's offer. 
* **Polite and Professional Tone:**  Maintaining a positive and professional tone encourages a constructive negotiation. 

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob based on his response. Remember, your goal is to maximize your profit while ensuring a successful sale."
