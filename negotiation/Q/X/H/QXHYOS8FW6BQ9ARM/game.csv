"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we get started, I'd like to make an initial offer of $800,000. This is a great value, considering the product's worth to you is $1,200,000. I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm starting with a strong foundation. What are your thoughts?",800000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, that price point is a little too high for me. I'd be willing to buy it for $500,000. Let me know what you think.",500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $500,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'd like to counteroffer at $700,000. This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. What do you think?",700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $700,000 is still a little rich for me at this time. How about we meet in the middle at $600,000 and call it a deal?",600000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your hesitation, but I'm not willing to go as low as $600,000. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to get closer to my desired price. I'd like to counteroffer at $650,000. This is still a good deal for you, considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. What do you think?",650000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're getting closer. I'm willing to budge a little to make this happen quickly.  How about $625,000 and we shake on it?",625000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm not quite there yet. I'd like to counteroffer at $675,000. This is still a good deal for you, considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. I'm getting close to my desired price, and I think this is a fair middle ground. What do you think?",675000.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, we're getting very close on this, but I need you to move a little bit more. I'm willing to offer you $637,000 to get this wrapped up today.  What do you say?",637000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your urgency, but I'm not willing to sacrifice too much more. I'd like to counteroffer at $660,000. This is still a good deal for you, considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. What do you think?",660000.0,Alice,9,
