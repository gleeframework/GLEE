I'm starting with a price of $20,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value, but it leaves room for negotiation. I believe this is a good starting point to gauge Bob's interest and see how much he values the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $15,000 is my minimum acceptable price, I believe there's still room for negotiation.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17500}
```

I'm going to counter with $17,500. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer. I'm hoping this will be a more attractive price for Bob while still allowing me to get a decent amount of money for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $14,000 is below my minimum acceptable price. While I would prefer to sell to Bob, the risk of further negotiation and the potential for further price drops is too high.  I'm going to sell to John for $15,000."
