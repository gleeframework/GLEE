"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this exceptional product. It's a rare and valuable item that I'm confident you'll find highly desirable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $2000000.",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the rarity of this product, $2000000 is outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $1000000 for it, given its potential value to me.  Let me know your thoughts.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1000000 is a significant amount, but I'm afraid I need to consider the product's true value. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1500000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. This is a fair price considering the product's rarity and potential benefits to you. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",1500000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1500000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm happy to meet you at $1200000, which is my maximum limit. This would allow us to both reach an agreement, and I believe the product is still worth this value to me. Let me know if this is something you are willing to consider.",1200000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm willing to meet you in the middle again. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1200000. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1400000, which is a compromise that still reflects the product's value. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",1400000.0,Alice,5,
