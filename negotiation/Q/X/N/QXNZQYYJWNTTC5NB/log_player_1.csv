Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the rarity of this product, $2000000 is outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $1000000 for it, given its potential value to me.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.

Bob's offer:

This would allow us to both reach an agreement, and I believe the product is still worth this value to me. Let me know if this is something you are willing to consider.
