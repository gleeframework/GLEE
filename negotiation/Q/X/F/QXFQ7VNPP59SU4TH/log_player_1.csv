Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. I believe it's a great deal for both of us, as it's worth significantly more to me.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Offer Price:** I'm starting with a price of $14,000, which is closer to my value of $15,000 than Bob's value of $12,000. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Message:** I'm being friendly and framing the offer as a win-win situation. Highlighting the value of the product to me also emphasizes the potential loss for Bob if he rejects the offer.

**Strategy:**

By starting with a higher price, I can potentially secure a higher profit. However, I'm also aware that Bob has a lower valuation and may reject my initial offer.  If that happens, I'm prepared to negotiate further and potentially accept a price closer to his value.  The alternative, selling to John for $15,000, serves as a safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of making a counteroffer. I'm willing to pay $13,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value. Let me know if you're willing to consider this offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $13,000 is closer to my minimum value of $15,000, I believe I can still get a better price. I'm not desperate to sell and I have a guaranteed alternative with John.  I'll proceed to the next round and see if I can negotiate a higher price.

**Strategy:**

By rejecting Bob's offer, I demonstrate that I'm not willing to settle for a price that's too low for me. This gives me leverage in the next round. I'll be able to make a counteroffer that is closer to my desired price while still being within Bob's acceptable range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. I'm still hoping for a bit more for the product, considering its value to me. How about $13,500?  This feels like a fair compromise that would allow us both to walk away happy. "", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer Price:** I'm offering $13,500, which is halfway between my previous offer of $14,000 and Bob's offer of $13,000. This demonstrates a willingness to compromise while still trying to maximize my profit. 
* **Message:**  I'm being polite and positive, emphasizing the ""fairness"" of my counteroffer.  I'm also using the language of ""compromise"" to appeal to Bob's sense of reason.

**Strategy:**

By making a counteroffer that's closer to my desired price, I'm increasing my chances of securing a deal while still leaving room for further negotiation if necessary.  It also signals that I am open to compromise, which might make Bob more receptive to my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your perspective, but I'm still not willing to go above $13,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $13,250. I think this is a fair price considering the market value and the price John is willing to sell it to me for. Let me know if you're willing to consider this offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $13,250 is still below my initial target of $14,000, it's within a reasonable range and close to my minimum value of $15,000.  

* **Risk vs. Reward:**  I've successfully negotiated a higher price than Bob's initial offer, and a further round of negotiation might not yield a significantly better outcome.  The risk of rejecting his offer is that he might walk away, leaving me with only John's offer of $15,000, which is a sure thing but not as profitable.
* **Time Value:**  Continuing negotiations could drag on, potentially wasting time and effort.  

**Strategy:**

Given the potential for a better outcome, the risk associated with further negotiation, and the time value of closing the deal, accepting Bob's offer seems like the most rational decision."
