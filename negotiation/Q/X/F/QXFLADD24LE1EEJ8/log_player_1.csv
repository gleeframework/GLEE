"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product, and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm offering it to you for $12,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price that's a bit higher than Bob's perceived value to see if I can get him to budge.
* **Room for Negotiation:** This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to lower the price slightly in subsequent rounds if necessary.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a positive and friendly tone to build rapport and encourage Bob to consider the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $9,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  
* **Negotiation is possible:** I believe there's still room for negotiation with Bob. I'll counteroffer in the next round to try and find a mutually acceptable price.
* **Selling to John:** While selling to John guarantees $15,000, I want to see if I can get closer to that price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $9,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down a bit. I'm offering the product for $11,000. This is still a fair price considering the value it brings.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-offer within range:**  $11,000 is a compromise that's closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum price. 
* **Maintaining Value:** I emphasize the value the product brings to reinforce the justification for the price.
* **Open for Discussion:** I use a positive and open tone, inviting Bob to continue the conversation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,200 for the product. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** While $10,200 is closer to my minimum price, it's still below the $15,000 I can get from John. 
* **Negotiation is still ongoing:**  There are still rounds left, and I want to see if I can get a better offer from Bob. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Selling to John guarantees a higher price, but I'm willing to take a small risk to potentially get closer to that price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. Let's try to find a middle ground. I'm willing to drop the price to $10,750. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the time we've spent negotiating. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10750}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a compromise price that's closer to Bob's offer, but still higher than my minimum acceptable price.
* **Value Justification:**  I continue to emphasize the product's value to justify the price.
* **Time Factor:**  I'm subtly hinting at the time we've invested in the negotiation, creating a sense of urgency for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is running out:** We are nearing the end of the negotiation process with only 4 rounds remaining.
* **Small gain, high risk:** While Bob's offer is closer to my desired price, it's still significantly less than what John is offering. Accepting Bob's offer would mean losing out on a significant amount of money.
* **Guarantee:** Selling to John guarantees me $15,000, which is my minimum acceptable price and significantly higher than what Bob is willing to pay.  
* **Risk Mitigation:**  I'm choosing to minimize risk and maximize my earnings by selling to John. There's no guarantee that Bob will come up to my desired price in the remaining rounds, and the potential loss is too significant."
