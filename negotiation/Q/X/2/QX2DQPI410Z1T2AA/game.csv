"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested, I'm not quite ready to go that high yet. I'm willing to pay $1,150,000 for the product.  This would still be a great deal for you and allows us both to walk away happy.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1150000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,150,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $1,250,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a great investment.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
