"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $2,000,000. This is a bold move, but it allows me to maximize potential profits. If Bob rejects, we can negotiate downwards.  It's important to set a high bar early on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,500,000 is my minimum, I'm hoping to get more.  I'll counter with a lower price than my initial offer, but still higher than Bob's. I want to see if there's some middle ground we can reach."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1800000}
``` 

I'm offering $1,800,000.  This is a significant drop from my initial offer, but it's still higher than Bob's offer and leaves room for further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While it's not my ideal price, $1,600,000 is a good deal, considering I could sell to John for $1,500,000. It's also important to keep in mind that we've already had a few rounds of negotiation, and further rounds might not yield a better result."
