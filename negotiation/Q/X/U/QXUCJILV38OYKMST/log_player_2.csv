"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for sale. I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $14,000. Is this something you'd be interested in? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
The product is worth $12,000 to Alice, so we can likely get it for less than $14,000. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price before buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you considering my budget. I'm really interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit above what I'm able to pay right now. Would you be willing to come down to $13,000?"", ""product_price"": 13000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $13,000 is a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $13,500. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair price considering the value the product brings. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice is willing to go down to $13,500, which is still a good deal for me since I'm willing to pay up to $15,000. Accepting her offer saves me $1,500 compared to buying from John."
