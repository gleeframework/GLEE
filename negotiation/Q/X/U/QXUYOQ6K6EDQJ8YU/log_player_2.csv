"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $9,500 is a good price, Bob can potentially get an even better deal by negotiating further.  He has 10 rounds, so there's time to see if Alice will budge further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob starts with a counteroffer that's a reasonable step down from Alice's initial offer.  He's aiming to get a price closer to his own value of $10,000, but he's not going to go too low in the first counteroffer to avoid scaring Alice off."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved slightly closer to Bob's desired price, and he's now only $800 away from his maximum value. While he could continue negotiating, there's a risk that Alice will reject his counteroffer again, and he could end up paying more in the long run.  Since there's a risk of losing out on this deal, accepting the offer is the most sensible choice."
