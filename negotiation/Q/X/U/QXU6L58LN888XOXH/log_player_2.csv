Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $80 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $125 to make this work.  It's a fair price considering the value of the product.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125

}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $95 is still too far below what I need to make this worthwhile.  Let's compromise. I'm willing to go down to $110. This is a fair price for both of us.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** While Alice is coming down on her price, it's unlikely she'll reach a price that beats John's offer of $100.  It's time to cut negotiations short and go with the guaranteed better deal."
