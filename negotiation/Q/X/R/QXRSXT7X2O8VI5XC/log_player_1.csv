"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to speak with you about this incredible product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm offering it to you at $2,200,000. I believe this price accurately reflects its worth and potential ROI for your specific needs."", 
""product_price"": 2200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High (but not ridiculously so):**  I'm starting significantly higher than my minimum ($1,500,000) and Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000). This allows room for negotiation and gives the impression the product is highly sought after. 
* **Justification:** I'm not just throwing out a number; I'm framing it around the product's ""unique value proposition"" and potential ROI. This encourages Bob to see beyond his initial valuation.
* **Leaving Room for John:** While I want to maximize profit, I also need to be mindful that I have a guaranteed offer from John.  Setting the initial price too high might make negotiations drag on, risking a potential deal with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for starting the conversation. While I agree the product has potential, the price point you've presented is significantly higher than I had in mind. I'd be willing to start the negotiation at $800,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob's offer is significantly below both my minimum and his own perceived value. Accepting would mean a substantial loss. It's time to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you starting the negotiation. However,  $800,000 significantly undervalues the potential this product holds for your business.  I'm confident that with a closer look at the long-term benefits, we can find common ground. I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This reflects my commitment to making this deal work while still recognizing the product's true value."", 
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant but Strategic Drop:** I'm making a substantial drop from my initial offer to show flexibility and encourage Bob to do the same. However, I'm still well above both his offer and my minimum.
* **Focusing on Value:** I'm continuing to emphasize the product's long-term benefits and ROI for Bob's business. This helps shift the focus from a simple price comparison to a value-based assessment.
* **Signaling Commitment:** By stating my willingness to find ""common ground,"" I'm showing Bob that I'm serious about reaching a deal. 
* **Maintaining Walk-Away Option:**  The offer, while lower, is still high enough to keep John's offer as a viable alternative."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for your willingness to negotiate. However, the price is still quite a bit higher than what I'm comfortable with. To move this forward, I could offer $1,000,000. This is my final offer, as I can secure the product elsewhere at this price point. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bluff Detection:** Bob's claim that he can get the product elsewhere at that price is likely a negotiating tactic. The product's unique value to him suggests he may not find an equivalent alternative.
* **Knowing My Worth:** While $1,000,000 is Bob's perceived value, it's still below my minimum. I'm willing to negotiate, but not at the cost of a significant loss. 
* **John as Leverage:**  I have a strong alternative with John's offer, giving me the leverage to push back on Bob's ""final offer."""

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but I believe your assessment doesn't reflect the full value this product brings. To be frank, I have another buyer interested at a higher price point. However, I believe in building strong business relationships and I see potential in partnering with you.  I'm willing to significantly reduce my price to $1,600,000, but this is non-negotiable. It's a limited-time offer reflecting my commitment to making this deal work for both of us."", 
""product_price"": 1600000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Introducing Competition (Subtly):**  I'm hinting at another buyer (John) without revealing specifics. This creates a sense of urgency and scarcity without being overly aggressive.
* **Firm but Fair:** By stating  $1,600,000 is ""non-negotiable,"" I'm setting a clear boundary. This conveys seriousness while still leaving room for Bob to accept a price significantly higher than his last offer.
* **Combination of Tactics:** This offer combines a significant price drop, a firm stance, and the introduction of competition. This multi-faceted approach increases the chances of Bob accepting while still exceeding my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Time Pressure:**  Mentioning it's a ""limited-time offer"" further encourages Bob to act quickly."
