"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to part with it for $1,000,000. This is a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I need to make sure it's within my budget. What do you think?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I appreciate your offer, I need to be closer to $1,000,000 to make this worthwhile.  How about we split the difference and go with $950,000? This is still a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price.  Let me know what you think.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $925,000 is getting closer, I need to be at $940,000 to make this deal work for me.  It's still a significant savings for you compared to what this product is worth to you. Let's close this deal.  What do you say?",940000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm getting close, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $940,000. I'm willing to go up to $920,000, but that's as high as I can go. I think this is a fair price for both of us. What do you think?",920000.0,Bob,6,
