"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you our amazing product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. As a valued customer, I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,500. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $12,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's still room for negotiation. Bob can likely get a better price by counter-offering."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $9,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  It's a fair price considering the value to me and your desired selling price. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial agreement. Considering your offer of $8,500, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $9,000. This is a great compromise, considering the value of the product to you and my desired selling price. What do you think?
