"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $9,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  It's a fair price considering the value to me and your desired selling price. Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,
