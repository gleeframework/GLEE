"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to buy this product, which I believe you'll find quite valuable, for $130. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is $130.**  This is within your budget of $150.
* **Buying from John costs $150.** This is more expensive than Alice's offer.

Therefore, it makes more sense to accept Alice's offer and save $20."
