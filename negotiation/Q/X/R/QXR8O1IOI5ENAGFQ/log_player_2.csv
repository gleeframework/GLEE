This offer represents a significant saving compared to its true worth, making it a fantastic investment for you. Please let me know if you would like to proceed with this exclusive deal. I look forward to your positive response. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's message tries to inflate the product's value to you, you know your upper limit is $1,200,000. Her offer of $1,150,000 saves you $50,000 compared to buying from John. It makes sense to accept her offer and avoid the higher price."
