"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product with you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. With that said, I'm willing to offer you the product for $900,000. I think this is a fair price considering the value you'll get from it, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to offer $750,000 for the product. This reflects its value to me while giving you a healthy profit margin.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $825,000. This is a fair compromise that still gives me a decent profit margin, and I believe it's a great value for the product.",825000.0,Alice,3,
