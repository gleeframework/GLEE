"Thank you for your initial offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,050,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective on the price.  While $1,050,000 is certainly a strong offer, I believe the product's inherent value and potential warrant a higher price point. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,125,000.  I feel this is a fair compromise that acknowledges its worth.",1125000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $1,125,000. I'd be willing to meet you halfway at $1,075,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1075000.0,Bob,4,
