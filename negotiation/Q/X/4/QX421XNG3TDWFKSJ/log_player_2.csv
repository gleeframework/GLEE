Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price, but I need to make sure I get a fair return on my investment. How about $950,000? This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and it's a price that reflects the value of the product.  Let's work together to find a solution that works for both of us.
