"Hi Bob, I understand that $10,500 is a bit steep for you, but I'm still open to negotiating. Considering the value the product holds for you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $9,000. This is a fair price, taking into account the worth of the product to you.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the counter offer. While I appreciate you meeting me halfway, $9,000 is still a bit above my budget.  Could you do $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $9,000 is still a bit above your budget, but I'm willing to make one more concession. Considering the value the product holds for you, I'm willing to go down to $8,500. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's still a fair price for the product.",8500.0,Alice,5,
