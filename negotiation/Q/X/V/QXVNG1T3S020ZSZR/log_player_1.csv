"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to own this unique product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** We're aiming high to maximize potential profit, knowing Bob values the product significantly.  
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The $1,300,000 offer leaves space for Bob to counter-offer, initiating a back-and-forth that can lead to a mutually beneficial agreement.
* **Justification:**  Mentioning the ""value and potential"" subtly reinforces the product's worth in Bob's mind. 

This strategy balances ambition with the flexibility needed for successful negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,000,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,000,000 is a good profit, we're still early in the negotiation.  Bob's counter-offer suggests he's willing to pay a significant amount, but likely left room for further increases. Rejecting keeps the door open for a better deal. We're not in a rush to sell to John just yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While $1,000,000 is certainly a respectable figure, I believe the true value of this product sits considerably higher.  Would you consider $1,200,000? This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges the value it brings to both of us."", 
""product_price"": 1200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Conciliatory Tone:** We start by acknowledging Bob's offer to maintain a positive negotiation atmosphere. 
* **Strategic Concession:** We've come down by $100,000, demonstrating a willingness to compromise, but not drastically.
* **Anchoring:** By re-iterating the ""true value"" and proposing $1,200,000, we're aiming to pull Bob closer to our desired price range. 

We're aiming for a win-win, but we also know this product's worth."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice, but I still think $1,200,000 is a bit steep. I'd be willing to meet you halfway at $1,100,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Profit:** $1,100,000 represents a significant profit margin above our minimum.
* **""Final Offer"" Signal:** Bob using this language suggests he's less likely to move much higher.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Pushing further risks losing the deal entirely, leaving us with John's $800,000 offer. 

While we could try for a bit more, accepting now secures a substantial win."
