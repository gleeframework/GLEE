"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. Given its value, I'm asking for $15,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is far above your maximum budget.  It makes sense to reject and start a negotiation to try and get a better price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I'm willing to negotiate, $10,000 is too low.  Could you do $13,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower, it's still above my budget.  I'll reject and try to negotiate further, keeping in mind that I can always buy from John for $10,000."
