Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,000,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me is $1,500,000, and I'm willing to make a compromise to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'll reject Bob's offer. While $1,000,000 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get closer to my desired price of $1,200,000. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer, but still leaving room for negotiation."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming down a bit in your offer. However, $1,000,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1,100,000.

While $950,000 is tempting, I'm still holding out for a higher price. I'll counter with an offer closer to my desired price of $1,100,000. There's still room for negotiation, and I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $975,000 is getting closer to my goal, I'm confident I can get a better price. There's still room for negotiation, and I believe we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. I'll counter with an offer closer to my desired price of $1,050,000."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your compromise, but $975,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,025,000.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1,025,000, but I'm still a bit away from my target. I'm willing to pay $990,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I place on it and the fact that I'm willing to compromise.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd like to get closer to my initial desired price, there's only two rounds left. Accepting Bob's offer of $990,000 is still a better deal than selling to John for $800,000.  It's important to secure the sale and avoid losing out completely."
