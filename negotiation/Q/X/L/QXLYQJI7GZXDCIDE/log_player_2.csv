"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which is valued at $10000 by you. I am offering it to you at a special price of $9500. This is a great opportunity to acquire an item that is worth significantly more than what you're paying. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $9,500 is a good deal compared to John's price of $10,000, Bob can likely get a better deal by negotiating with Alice.  He knows the product is worth $8,000 to Alice, so there's room for a lower price."

{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. While it's tempting, I'm hoping to get a bit closer to my budget. I'd be willing to pay $8,500 for the product. This still represents a good profit for you, and it's the best I can offer right now."", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I appreciate your offer. In light of your proposal, I would like to counter with a price of $9000 for the product. This still represents a significant profit for me while remaining competitive with your offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is still aiming to save as much money as possible.  While $9,000 is better than John's $10,000,  he knows Alice's bottom line is likely closer to his counteroffer of $8,500. There's still room to negotiate and get a lower price."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but I'm still hoping to get closer to my original offer.  I'm willing to go to $8,750. This is a fair compromise and allows us both to get a good deal.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8750}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your position, Bob. Considering your latest offer, I am willing to consider $8900 for the product. This is a reasonable compromise that allows us both to achieve a satisfactory outcome. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $8,900 is only $250 more than Bob's last counteroffer of $8,750. At this point, continuing to negotiate might not yield a significantly better price, and Bob risks Alice walking away and forcing him to buy from John at $10,000.  It's a good deal for Bob, and accepting saves him $1,100 compared to John's price."
