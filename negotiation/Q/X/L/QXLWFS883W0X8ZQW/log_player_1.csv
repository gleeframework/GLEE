Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's significantly higher than my minimum price of $800,000, but also leaves room for negotiation.  Bob is likely to counteroffer, allowing us to settle on a price that is beneficial to both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me. Could you consider $900,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still below my desired price point. I'm confident that I can secure a higher price by continuing the negotiation. I'll reject his counteroffer and see if I can get him closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $900,000 is still a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,050,000? I believe this price is still a great deal for you, given the product's value to you, and it gives me a better return on my investment. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  How about we settle at $975,000? I think that's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $975,000 is close to my desired price point, and it's worth taking the deal to avoid the risk of further negotiation. While I could potentially squeeze out a bit more, there's no guarantee I'll be able to do so, and it's possible that Bob might walk away.  This offer is significantly better than selling to John for $800,000, so it's the best option at this point."
