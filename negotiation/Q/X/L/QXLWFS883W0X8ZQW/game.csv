"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me. Could you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $900,000 is still a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,050,000? I believe this price is still a great deal for you, given the product's value to you, and it gives me a better return on my investment. Let me know your thoughts.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
