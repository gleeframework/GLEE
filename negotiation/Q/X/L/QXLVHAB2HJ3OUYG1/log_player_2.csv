Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer but $2,300,000 is far above my budget.  I'm interested in this product but can only go as high as $800,000.  This is a fair price considering my maximum budget and the value you've placed on it."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $800,000 is significantly below its value. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to lower my price to $1,900,000. This offer reflects a substantial reduction on my part while acknowledging the product's inherent worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While $1,900,000 is better than Alice's initial offer, it's still significantly more than you're willing to pay. It's worth continuing to negotiate with Alice to see if you can reach a mutually agreeable price."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my price, but $1,900,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see you're serious about this product, and I want to find an agreement that works for both of us. However, $1,100,000 is still considerably below my bottom line. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000.  This is my final offer, as it represents a significant compromise on a product I know holds immense value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000

Alice's offer is still above your budget.  You should try to negotiate further.  While you could buy from John for $800,000, you might be able to get a better deal from Alice if you continue the negotiation."
