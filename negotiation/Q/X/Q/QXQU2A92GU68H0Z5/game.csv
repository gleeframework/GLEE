"I understand that $150 is a good starting point, but I think the product's value is higher than that. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $175. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really appreciate the quality of the product.",175.0,Alice,3,

"I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're getting too far apart. I'm willing to make another concession, but I think I've already gone as low as I can. I'll offer it to you for $155. It's the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great deal for the product.",155.0,Alice,7,

"I'm getting a bit frustrated that we're still not meeting in the middle. I've already gone as low as I can, and I think it's time to draw a line. I'm willing to meet you at $145, but no lower. It's the best I can do, and I think it's still a fair price for the product.",145.0,Alice,9,
