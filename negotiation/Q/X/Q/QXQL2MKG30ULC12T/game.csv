"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1200000. I think this is a fair price considering its value to you, but I'm open to negotiations. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I think $1200000 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the value of the product to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $900000 is a significant discount, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. Considering its value to me, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering a counteroffer of $1100000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice. However, $1100000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to compromise further and make a new counteroffer of $950000. I hope we can find a mutually agreeable price.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $950000 is still a bit above your budget, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $1050000. This is the absolute minimum I'm willing to accept for this product. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm willing to consider it.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're not willing to go any lower than $1050000, Alice. However, I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to make one more attempt at a compromise. I'll offer $980000 for the product. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'll consider it.",980000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go below $1050000. I'm willing to make a slight adjustment to my previous offer. I'm willing to meet you at $1020000. This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to negotiate further.",1020000.0,Alice,7,
