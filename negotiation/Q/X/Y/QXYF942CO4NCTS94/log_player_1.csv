{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. This is a great price, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 
 
This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're still getting a significant profit above your minimum of $800,000.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** You have space to lower the price slightly if needed, while still getting a good deal.
* **It's appealing to Bob:**  $950,000 is likely still a good value for Bob, as he values the product at $1,000,000. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking of something more in the range of $750,000. Would you be willing to consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $750,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $800,000.  I'll reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $750,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but  $850,000 is my absolute minimum.  It's still a great price for you, considering the value of the product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, Alice, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. How about $825,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $825,000 is just above my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, accepting this offer ensures a quick sale and avoids further negotiation."
