Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm offering it to you for $130, which is a great deal. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price of $130, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Framing:** I use positive language like ""amazing product"" and ""great deal"" to make the offer more appealing.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I leave the door open for Bob to counteroffer,  acknowledging that we may need to discuss the price further.

**Strategy:**

This approach aims to:

* **Maximize Profit:**  By starting high, I aim to get closer to my minimum desired price of $150.
* **Maintain Flexibility:**  The counteroffer system allows me to adapt to Bob's willingness to pay.
* **Secure a Sale:** If Bob rejects the initial offer, I can continue negotiating or sell to John as a backup."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the product, but I'm looking to keep my expenses lower. Would you consider selling it for $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  While Bob's offer is better than his perceived value, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **Opportunity for a better price:** I believe I can likely secure a higher price through further negotiation.
* **John is a strong alternative:** Having John as a backup buyer at $150 gives me confidence to reject Bob's offer and continue negotiating.

**Strategy:**

By rejecting Bob's offer, I'm signaling that I'm not willing to settle for a price that undervalues my product.  I'll counteroffer with a price closer to my desired range. This approach keeps the negotiation open and allows me to potentially secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you're looking for a good deal. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price.  Would you be interested in $120? It's still a fair price for the quality of this product."", ""product_price"": 120}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm lowering my price from $130 to $120, showing willingness to negotiate.
* **Justification:** I'm emphasizing the quality of the product to justify the price. 
* **Positive tone:** I use a positive and friendly tone to maintain a good relationship with Bob.

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer aims to:

* **Bridge the gap:** It's a compromise between my initial price and Bob's offer, making a deal more likely.
* **Maintain leverage:** $120 is still a price I'm comfortable with, and it leaves some room for further negotiation if needed. 
* **Test Bob's interest:** This counteroffer will reveal whether Bob is genuinely interested in buying the product or just trying to get the lowest possible price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your price. I appreciate it. However, I'm still looking to keep my expenses low. Could you consider selling it for $110? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** While $110 is closer to my minimum acceptable price of $150, it's still not high enough to justify continuing the negotiation.
* **John is a safe option:** Selling to John guarantees me my desired price of $150 without further negotiation or risk.
* **Time is valuable:** Further negotiation with Bob could take more time and effort, and there's no guarantee that he will eventually agree to a price I find acceptable.

**Strategy:**

By selling to John, I avoid the potential for a drawn-out negotiation with Bob.  It's a quick and secure way to achieve my financial goal."
