Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its unique value proposition, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm asking for $950,000, which reflects its true worth. What do you say?"",
""product_price"": 950000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:** Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,000,000, I want to see if I can get even more from Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $950,000 leaves room for negotiation while still aiming for a price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($800,000). 
* **Confident Language:** Using phrases like ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""true worth"" aims to increase the product's perceived value in Bob's mind.

This strategy allows me to potentially:

1. **Secure a Deal with Bob:** If Bob accepts the $950,000, I make a larger profit.
2. **Negotiate:**  Bob might counter-offer, and we can negotiate a price closer to my desired range.
3. **Proceed with John:** If Bob rejects the offer, I haven't lost anything and can confidently sell to John at my guaranteed price."
