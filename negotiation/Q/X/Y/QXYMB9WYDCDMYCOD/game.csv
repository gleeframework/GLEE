I'm thinking of selling it to you for $950000. This is a great deal, considering its true value to you is $1000000. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but I'm still a bit higher than $875000. I'm thinking more along the lines of $825000. This is a fair price for me, considering the product's value to me is $1000000.",825000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your position, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $825000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $850000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's true value to me is $800000. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,5,
