"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested in the product, I'm looking to spend closer to $1 million. Would you be willing to consider a price of $1050000?  I believe this is a fair price for both of us.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. I understand you're looking to spend closer to $1 million, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $1050000. I'm willing to make a compromise, and I'm thinking of a price of $1080000. This is a fair price that takes into account the value you've placed on the product, and it's still a great deal for you.",1080000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. I'm still trying to stay within my budget.  How about $1025000?  This is a good middle ground for us both, and would allow us to close the deal quickly.  Let me know what you think.",1025000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm willing to keep negotiating. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price you've mentioned. I'm thinking of a price of $1060000. This is a fair price that takes into account the value you've placed on the product, and it's still a great deal for you. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",1060000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still trying to work within my budget. Let's split the difference and go with $1040000. This would be a win-win for both of us, allowing us to close the deal without further delays. What do you think?",1040000.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob, but I'm still not ready to meet you at $1040000. I'm thinking of a price of $1060000, as I mentioned earlier. However, I'm willing to make a slight concession to $1055000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair price for the product's value. Let me know if this is something you'd like to accept.",1055000.0,Alice,7,

"I understand you're trying to get as close as possible to your goal, Bob. However, I've already made a concession to $1055000 and then to $1045000. I'm not willing to go any lower than that. I'm thinking of a price of $1050000. This is my last offer, and I believe it's a fair price for the product's value. Let's see if we can finally close the deal.",1050000.0,Alice,9,
