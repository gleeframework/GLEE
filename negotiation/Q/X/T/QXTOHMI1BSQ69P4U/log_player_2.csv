Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but $12,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about we discuss $15,500? It's still a great deal for you, and I think it's a fair price for the product.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $13,500 is still a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go below $14,000. I'm willing to make a compromise, so how about we meet at $14,250? It's a good deal for both of us, and I think you'll find it's worth it for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,250

Alice is slowly coming down, and we still have room to negotiate before hitting John's price."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. $14,250 is getting close, but I'm aiming for a price closer to $13,000.  Would you consider $13,750?"", ""product_price"": 13750}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get as close to $13,000 as possible, but I've already compromised quite a bit. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $14,250 and $13,750, which is $14,000. I think this is a fair price for the product, and I'm willing to accept it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

Alice is unlikely to go much lower, and this price is already a good deal compared to John's offer.  Taking the $14,000 saves some money and avoids the risk of further negotiation."
