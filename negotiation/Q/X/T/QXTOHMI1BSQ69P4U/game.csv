"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire it at a fair price. I'm willing to sell it to you for $18,000. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $18,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $12,000?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but $12,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about we discuss $15,500? It's still a great deal for you, and I think it's a fair price for the product.",15500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for countering.  While $15,500 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a little too high for my budget. How about we settle at $13,500?",13500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $13,500 is still a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go below $14,000. I'm willing to make a compromise, so how about we meet at $14,250? It's a good deal for both of us, and I think you'll find it's worth it for the product.",14250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. $14,250 is getting close, but I'm aiming for a price closer to $13,000.  Would you consider $13,750?",13750.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get as close to $13,000 as possible, but I've already compromised quite a bit. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $14,250 and $13,750, which is $14,000. I think this is a fair price for the product, and I'm willing to accept it.",14000.0,Alice,7,
