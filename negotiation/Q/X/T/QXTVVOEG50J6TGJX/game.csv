"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Can you meet me there?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $9,000 is tempting, I need to get closer to $11,000 to make this work for me.  I'm confident this product is worth it for you, and I'm happy to keep talking to find a price that works for both of us.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested, but I'm not sure I can go as high as $11,000. How about we meet in the middle at $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I hear you, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $10,000 is getting closer, but I'm still a bit away from where I need to be.  How about we split the difference and go with $10,500?  This would give me a little more wiggle room, and it's still a great deal for you considering the value of this product.",10500.0,Alice,5,

"I'm getting close to my limit, but I'm still not comfortable with $10,500. How about we try $9,800? That's as high as I'm willing to go.",9800.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $9,800 is getting close, but I need to get a little closer to $10,000 to make this work.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,900? This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's still a good value for you.  Let's close this deal!",9900.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm not sure I can go any higher than $9,800, and I'm starting to get a little worried that I might not be able to get the product at a good price. Can you think about meeting me at $9,800?",9800.0,Bob,8,
