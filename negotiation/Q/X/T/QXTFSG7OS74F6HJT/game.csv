"Alice, your offer is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product,  which is still a fair price considering its value. Let's work together to reach an agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,200,000 is significantly below what I can accept. This product offers unique value and its potential is substantial.  Let's meet in the middle â€“ how about $1,900,000?",1900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,900,000 is still out of my price range.  To show my good faith, I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000. This represents a considerable investment for me, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's potential.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
