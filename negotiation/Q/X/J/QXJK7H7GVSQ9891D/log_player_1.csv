Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly less than what it's worth to you and still a handsome profit for me. Let's get this deal done!"", ""product_price"": 1400000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product. It's a fair price that reflects its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  While I want to close the deal, I won't sacrifice too much profit.  I'll see if I can negotiate a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $1,100,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000, which is still a great deal for you considering what the product is worth. Let's find common ground and close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're looking for a fair price. How about we meet in the middle at $1,175,000? That's a significant compromise on my end and shows I'm serious about making this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,175,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,175,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While it's not my ideal price, it's above my minimum threshold of $1,000,000 and represents a significant gain for me.  I'm willing to close the deal at this point rather than risk losing the sale completely."
