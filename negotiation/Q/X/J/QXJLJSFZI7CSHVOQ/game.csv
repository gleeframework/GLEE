"Hello Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm very interested in this product, but $1,400,000 is a bit too high for my budget.  Would you consider $1,050,000? I believe that's a fair price that reflects its value to me.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,400,000 is a bit high for your budget. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,050,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,275,000. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's value to you, and I believe it's a fair price considering the worth of the product to you is $1,200,000.",1275000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $1,275,000 is still a bit too steep for me. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,125,000. That's a significant jump from my previous offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise.",1125000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,125,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $1,225,000. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's value to you, and I believe it's a fair price considering the worth of the product to you is $1,200,000.",1225000.0,Alice,5,
