Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", ""product_price"": 119}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to $120 as possible, as that's her guaranteed profit from John.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $119 leaves a small window for Bob to counter-offer if he's really interested, but still ensures Alice a good profit.
* **Above Bob's Value:**  The offer is slightly above Bob's perceived value ($100), but not excessively so. This might entice him, especially if the product offers additional benefits not factored into his valuation. 

**Important Note:** This assumes Alice doesn't know Bob's exact valuation. If she did, she could offer it at $100. However, in a real negotiation, that information is usually hidden."
