"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer, but $15,000 is too high for my budget. I'd be willing to pay $8,000 for the product. Let me know what you think.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Bob, but $8,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so I'm counteroffering at $11,000. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down, Alice.  However, $11,000 is still a bit of a stretch for me. Could you do $9,500?  That would work much better for my budget.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm not quite there yet, Bob. I'm willing to compromise, but $9,500 is still a bit low for me. I'll meet you halfway between $11,000 and $9,500, so I'm counteroffering at $10,250. What do you think?",10250.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, you're really close! I can tell we're both motivated to make this deal happen. How about we split the difference - $10,100 and we call it a deal?",10100.0,Bob,6,

"I like your spirit, Bob! However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $10,100. I'll come down a bit more, to $10,200. I think that's a fair price, and I'm confident you'll love the product. What do you think?",10200.0,Alice,7,
