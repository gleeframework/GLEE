"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I really appreciate you being open to negotiation. However, $15000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $8000 for the product. What do you think?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $8000 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $12000. This takes into account your budget and still allows me to get a fair price for this valuable product.  Let me know if you're interested in moving forward at this price.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your need to make a profit, but $12000 is still a little high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10000. This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing you to make a decent profit while I can stay within my budget. Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,4,
