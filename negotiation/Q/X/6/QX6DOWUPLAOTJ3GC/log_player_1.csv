Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $14,000. I know this product is valuable to you, and I believe this is a fair price. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximum Profit:** Bob values the product at $15,000, so there's potential to sell it for more than your minimum acceptable price ($12,000).
* **Negotiating Room:** Offering it at $14,000 leaves some room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Backup Plan:**  You have a guaranteed sale at $12,000 to John, so there's less pressure to accept a low offer from Bob.

By starting high but leaving room for negotiation, you maximize your chances of getting the best possible price from Bob."
