{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

You should accept Alice's offer. You are only $800 over your limit, and it's likely Alice won't go lower, especially since she is already giving you a better deal than her initial price.  It's better to accept this offer than to risk further negotiations and potentially ending up paying more."
