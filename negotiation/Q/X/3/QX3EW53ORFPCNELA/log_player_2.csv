"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm confident you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12000. This is a great deal, considering its value to me is at least $10000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is at your maximum price point. There's no immediate benefit to accepting. By rejecting, you open the possibility of negotiating a lower price, potentially saving some money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the value you place on this product, $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable spending right now.  I'm willing to pay $10,000 for it.  Let me know if that's something you're open to discussing."", ""product_price"": 10000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $12000 is a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11000. This is the lowest price I'm comfortable with, considering its value to me. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price to $11,000. This is a good deal for Bob, as it's lower than his maximum price point of $12,000. Accepting the offer saves Bob $1,000 compared to buying from John. There's no guarantee that further negotiation will result in a lower price, and Bob is already saving money."
