Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth more than $150 to me, but I understand its value may be different for you. Let's start at $120. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}"

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
