Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to buy this product, which I believe you'll find valuable, for $130.  Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Value:** Bob values the product at $150.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $80.
* **Maximizing Profit:**  You want to offer a price that's appealing to Bob (below his perceived value) while maximizing your profit. 

Offering the product for $130 leaves room for potential negotiation while still securing a significant profit margin for you."
