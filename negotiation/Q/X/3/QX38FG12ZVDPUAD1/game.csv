"Hi Alice,  While I appreciate your offer, $17,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to offer $10,000 for the product.  This price is fair considering my desired value and your potential profit margin. Let's work together to find a solution that works for both of us.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $17,000 represents the high-end of its value, I understand your budget constraints.  How about we meet in the middle at $14,500? This considers both our positions and keeps it a win-win.",14500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $14,500 is still outside my budget.  Let's split the difference - I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product.  This price is reasonable, considering both our needs, and would allow us to complete this transaction quickly.  What do you say?",12000.0,Bob,4,
