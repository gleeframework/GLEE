I'm starting with a price of $10,000, which is higher than my minimum acceptable price of $8,000. This gives me some room to negotiate down if Bob is willing to counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $8,500 is better than $8,000, I'm hoping to get closer to my initial asking price.  I'll reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm offering $9,500, which is halfway between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. This shows I'm willing to compromise but still want a fair price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000.

Bob's offer of $9,000 is a good compromise and very close to my ideal price. It's better than selling to John for $8,000, so I'll accept."
