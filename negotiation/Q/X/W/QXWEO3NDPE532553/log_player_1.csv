{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is clearly trying to wear me down and has circled back to his original lowball offer of $1,200,000.  It's important to show him I'm not going to budge from my previous stance and am willing to walk away if necessary."

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob has significantly dropped his offer and is now well below my minimum acceptable price. It's clear he's not willing to negotiate fairly and is trying to lowball me. Selling to John for $800,000 is a guaranteed profit and avoids the risk of wasting further time with Bob, who may continue to lowball.  It's better to take the guaranteed profit now than to potentially lose a sale entirely by continuing to negotiate with an unreasonable buyer."
