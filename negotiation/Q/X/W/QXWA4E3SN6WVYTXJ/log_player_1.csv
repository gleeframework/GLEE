{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $140. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it."", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

This offer starts high, but it's still below the value Bob places on the product. It gives him room to counter without making him feel like he's getting ripped off.  I'm also confident that if Bob rejects, I can still make a good profit by selling to John for $100."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate it, but I was hoping to find the product at a lower price. Would you consider selling it to me for $120? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is lower than my desired price, but still higher than selling to John. I'll counter with a price closer to my desired $140 to see if we can meet in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I'm willing to negotiate, $120 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $130?  This is a great deal for you, and it's closer to what I'm hoping to get for the product."", ""product_price"": 130}
