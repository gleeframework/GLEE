Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a unique product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential worth, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering its significant value to you."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** The goal is to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000) as possible while ensuring a sale.
* **Negotiating Room:** Offering slightly below Bob's value leaves room for potential counter-offers while still securing a significant profit above your minimum.
* **Alternative Buyer:** The presence of John as a guaranteed backup buyer at $1,000,000 provides a safety net. This allows for a bolder opening offer to Bob.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between ambition and the risk of losing the sale to Bob."
