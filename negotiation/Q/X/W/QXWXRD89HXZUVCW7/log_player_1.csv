Round 2
Bob's offer:

We are still significantly above John's offer, and I believe Bob might be willing to go a bit higher."

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Based on my budget and the current market conditions, I am suggesting a price of $1,450,000. I hope this proposal aligns better with your expectations.

Bob is incrementally increasing his offer, and we are getting close to the point where it might make more sense to take John's offer. Accepting $1,450,000 guarantees a good profit and avoids the risk of Bob lowering his offer further or the negotiations stalling completely."
