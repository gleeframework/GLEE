"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its incredible value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,800,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth.",1800000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product, but given my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price closer to what I can afford. How about $1,500,000?",1500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I'm motivated to sell, $1,500,000 undervalues the product significantly.  How about we meet halfway at $1,650,000? This reflects the product's true value while still acknowledging your budget.",1650000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your response, Alice. I appreciate your effort in valuing the product. Considering my financial situation, could we discuss a price closer to $1,400,000? I believe this would be a fair compromise.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. However, $1,400,000 is a significant drop, and I need to ensure I'm getting a fair deal. How about we settle on $1,550,000? This represents a compromise we can both feel good about.",1550000.0,Alice,5,
