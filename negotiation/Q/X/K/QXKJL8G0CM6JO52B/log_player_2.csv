Round 3
Alice's offer:

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $7,000 is still lower than I'd hoped for, I'm willing to come down to $9,500.  This is a significant price reduction, and I believe it's a fair offer considering the value you'll gain. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're getting closer. I'm willing to make my final offer at $8,500. This is a considerable compromise, and I believe it reflects the true value of the product. Let me know if this works for you, otherwise, I'll need to explore other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

At this point, Alice is down to $8,500 and is unlikely to go much lower.  While she might budge a little more, you can get the product for $8,000 from John with certainty. It's not worth the risk of continued negotiation with Alice."
