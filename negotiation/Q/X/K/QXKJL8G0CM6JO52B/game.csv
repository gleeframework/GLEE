"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and features, I'm asking for $15,000. I'm confident you'll find this a worthwhile investment.",15000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $15,000 is way above my budget. This product would be worth $6,000 to me.  Would you consider a price in that range?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $6,000 is significantly below its true value. How about we meet in the middle at $10,500? This offer reflects the product's worth while considering your interest.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. However, $10,500 is still too high for me. I could stretch my budget to $7,000. Would that be acceptable?",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $7,000 is still lower than I'd hoped for, I'm willing to come down to $9,500.  This is a significant price reduction, and I believe it's a fair offer considering the value you'll gain.",9500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $9,500 is still more than I'm comfortable spending.  I can offer $7,500. That's a fair compromise, in my opinion.",7500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting closer. I'm willing to make my final offer at $8,500. This is a considerable compromise, and I believe it reflects the true value of the product. Let me know if this works for you, otherwise, I'll need to explore other options.",8500.0,Alice,7,
