"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $2000000. It's a great deal for you, as you know it's worth at least $800000 to you. Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable price.",2000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I'm willing to pay no more than $1200000 for the product. I think that's a fair price considering its value to me.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1200000 is simply too low for me. It's significantly less than what I know the product is worth to you. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $1600000.  This still leaves you with a substantial profit margin. What do you say?",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1400000 for the product. I think this is a fair compromise.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your effort to find a compromise, but $1400000 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's try $1500000.  This would allow me to move forward with this deal, and it still leaves you with a very healthy profit.  It's a win-win situation.",1500000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand your position, Alice, but I'm still not willing to go above $1400000. I'm willing to make a small concession and offer $1420000 for the product. I think this is as high as I can go.",1420000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your compromise.  However, $1420000 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's aim for a final price of $1450000. This is a fair compromise that allows us both to move forward. I'm confident this is the final price we can both agree on.",1450000.0,Alice,7,
