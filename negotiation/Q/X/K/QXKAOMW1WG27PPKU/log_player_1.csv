Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I'm willing to pay no more than $1200000 for the product. I think that's a fair price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $1,200,000 is more than I'd get from John right now, I believe I can get a better price from Bob if I keep negotiating."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me. It's significantly less than what I know the product is worth to you.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1400000 for the product. I think this is a fair compromise.

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,400,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still confident I can push for a higher price. I'm not going to sell to John yet because I have a better chance of getting a higher price from Bob."

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,500,000. I've been negotiating with Bob for a while, and it seems like we're not going to be able to reach a mutually agreeable price.  While I would prefer to get more, John's offer is a good one, and I don't want to risk losing out on this deal by continuing to negotiate with Bob."
