"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm interested, but $140 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go right now. How about $130? "", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a counteroffer that is still higher than Alice's minimum, but shows he is serious about negotiating. This gives Alice room to make a concession without feeling like she's giving too much away."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand where you're coming from, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about 135? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $135, which is a good compromise.  It's still a bit higher than Bob's ideal price, but it's a better deal than buying from John and is a fair compromise from Alice.  Accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product and saves money compared to John."
