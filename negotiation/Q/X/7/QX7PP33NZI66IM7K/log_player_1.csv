Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,000,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the product's value and the current market conditions.

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm glad we're getting closer, but I still think $1,050,000 is a bit above my target. I'm willing to go up to $1,025,000, but I'd like to see if we can meet at $1,020,000. That's the highest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,020,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,020,000

}
``` 

While we could continue negotiating, accepting $1,020,000 is a solid deal. Here's why:

* **Profitable:** It's a $20,000 profit over your minimum acceptable price and John's offer.
* **Time Value:**  Closing the deal now avoids the risk of Bob lowering his offer or the negotiation dragging on. 
* **Uncertainty:** There's no guarantee Bob will go higher, and we risk pushing him away by continuously rejecting his offers."
