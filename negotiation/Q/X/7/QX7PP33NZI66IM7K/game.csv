"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this truly unique product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,150,000 is fair. What do you think?",1150000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,000,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the product's value and the current market conditions.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price, but I'm confident this product offers significantly more value than your initial offer reflects.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,075,000?  This feels like a fair compromise.",1075000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I still think $1,075,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to go up to $1,025,000, but that's as high as I'm comfortable going. I'm hoping we can meet somewhere in the middle of that range.",1025000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  It seems we're getting closer. How about we split the difference and settle at $1,050,000? This allows us both to walk away feeling good about the deal.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're getting closer, but I still think $1,050,000 is a bit above my target. I'm willing to go up to $1,025,000, but I'd like to see if we can meet at $1,020,000. That's the highest I'm willing to go.",1020000.0,Bob,6,
