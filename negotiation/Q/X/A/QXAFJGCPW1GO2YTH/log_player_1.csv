Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm asking for $10,000.  What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with a price higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and might lead Bob to accept a price higher than $8,000.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** By offering the product at $10,000, I signal that I'm willing to negotiate, as I have a buffer above my minimum selling price. 
* **Gauging Bob's Interest:**  This initial offer helps me understand how interested Bob is in the product. If he outright rejects it, I can always adjust my price down towards $8,000.

**Important Note:**  There's always a risk that Bob will walk away if the initial offer is too high. However, since I have a guaranteed buyer at $8,000 (John), the potential reward of securing a higher price outweighs the risk of losing Bob as a buyer."
