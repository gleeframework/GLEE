Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer starts high, leaving room for negotiation. It also emphasizes the value to Bob, potentially motivating him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $14,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $11,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $11,000 is better than nothing, it's below my minimum acceptable price. I'll counteroffer Bob and try to negotiate a price closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob,  I appreciate your interest.  $11,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $12,500? That would still be a great deal for you, considering the product's worth. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 12500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me. $12,500 is closer, but still a bit of a stretch. Could you do $11,750? I think that's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still not high enough to meet my minimum price.  Since I can sell to John for $12,000, I'll take that offer instead of risking further negotiation with Bob."
