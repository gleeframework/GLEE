"I appreciate your confidence in the product's value, but I'm not sure I can go as high as $1750000. I'm willing to pay $1600000 for the product, considering its value to me. I'm looking to make a fair deal, but I need to stay within my budget.",1600000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I value your interest in the product, $1600000 is unfortunately below my minimum acceptable price. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $1650000. This price reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your financial considerations.  I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1650000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1650000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1575000 for the product. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle and find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1575000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and we're getting closer to a deal.  However, $1575000 is still a bit below my minimum.  To show my commitment to finding a solution, I'm willing to drop my price to $1590000.  This is a fair compromise and allows us both to walk away feeling good about the transaction.  Let's get this done.",1590000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to pay $1580000 for the product. I think this is a fair price that reflects its value to me, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price.",1580000.0,Bob,6,
