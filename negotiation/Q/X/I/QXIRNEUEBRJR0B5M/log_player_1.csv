{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,500,000. It's a unique opportunity and I believe it holds significant value for you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1500000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price higher than my minimum acceptable value, leaving room for potential concessions if needed. The message is friendly and emphasizes the product's value, hoping to encourage Bob to consider the offer seriously."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $1500000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,200,000 is my minimum acceptable price, I want to try to get a higher price if possible.  Bob's offer is too low and I will try to counter-offer and see if we can reach a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position. While I'm willing to negotiate, $1,200,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle at $1,350,000? It's a fair price that allows both of us to benefit from this deal."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1350000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $1200000, but I'm not willing to go any higher. Is there any flexibility in your pricing? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob is not willing to budge from his offer of $1,200,000. While I can try to counter-offer again, there's no guarantee that he'll change his mind. I've already gone through a few rounds of negotiation, and further back-and-forth might not be productive. 

Instead of risking a prolonged negotiation that might not yield a better result, I will accept John's offer of $1,200,000. This ensures I receive my minimum acceptable price and avoids the risk of further negotiation with Bob, who seems unlikely to increase his offer."
