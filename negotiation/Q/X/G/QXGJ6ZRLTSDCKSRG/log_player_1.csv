Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. I believe it would be highly beneficial to you. I'm willing to part with it for $11,000."",
""product_price"": 11000
}
```

Here's why this strategy makes sense:

* **Maximize Potential Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed sale at $12,000, there's a chance to earn an extra $1,000 by offering it to Bob first. 
* **Reasonable Markup:** The offered price of $11,000 is a significant markup from Bob's perceived value ($8,000) but still a potential ""deal"" compared to your guaranteed sale price.
* **Time Value:** Selling to Bob directly might be faster than waiting for John to complete the purchase, even if John's price is slightly higher. 

This offer aims to strike a balance between maximizing potential profit and increasing the likelihood of Bob accepting the deal."
