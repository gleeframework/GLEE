{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. I believe this is a fair price, given its value to you.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for several reasons:

* **It's higher than Bob's perceived value:** This gives Bob some room to negotiate and feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **It's significantly lower than your minimum:** This gives you space to negotiate downwards if Bob counteroffers, while still ensuring you profit handsomely.
* **It establishes a clear starting point:** This helps to frame the negotiation and sets expectations for both parties. 

I'll be watching closely to see how Bob responds and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I think the product is worth less to me than you do. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it. I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $850,000 is still a decent amount of money, it's significantly less than my minimum goal of $1,000,000.  I'm willing to negotiate further, but I'm not ready to settle for such a low price yet.  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to counteroffer and potentially secure a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further. How about $900,000? This still gives you a good deal, while ensuring I can cover my costs. Let's see if we can find common ground here."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Bob halfway:** This counteroffer shows I'm willing to negotiate and compromise while still protecting my interests. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  $900,000 is still above Bob's initial offer, giving him incentive to come up to meet me.
* **Maintaining a firm stance:**  While I've lowered my price, it's still significantly higher than Bob's offer, demonstrating that I won't simply give in."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. How about $875,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $875,000 is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum target of $1,000,000.  I'm still confident that I can negotiate a higher price, especially since Bob seems genuinely interested in the product. Rejecting this offer allows me to counteroffer and potentially secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate.  However, $875,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to compromise further and meet you at $925,000. This is a fair price that considers both our needs, and I believe it would be a good deal for both of us. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 925000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maintaining a firm stance:**  This counteroffer demonstrates that I am willing to negotiate, but I won't be bullied into accepting a low price.
* **Offering a compromise:**  $925,000 is a significant step closer to Bob's offer, demonstrating my willingness to compromise.  
* **Highlighting mutual benefit:** This counteroffer emphasizes the potential for a win-win situation. By meeting at $925,000, both of us could walk away with a satisfying outcome."
