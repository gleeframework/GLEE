"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I think the product is worth less to me than you do. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it. I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further. How about $900,000? This still gives you a good deal, while ensuring I can cover my costs. Let's see if we can find common ground here.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. How about $875,000?",875000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate.  However, $875,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to compromise further and meet you at $925,000. This is a fair price that considers both our needs, and I believe it would be a good deal for both of us. What do you say?",925000.0,Alice,5,
