"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you're providing, $1,250,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product, considering its potential benefits. This offer is my best possible price, and I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your prompt response, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. In light of your offer, I would like to counter with a price of $1,150,000. This reflects a compromise that maintains a fair value for our product while acknowledging your budget constraints. I believe this could be a mutually beneficial arrangement. Please let me know if this proposal is acceptable, or if there's anything else we can discuss to facilitate a successful transaction.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price, but $1,150,000 is still a bit outside my comfort zone.  I'm firm on my previous offer of $1,050,000.  This represents a significant compromise for me, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
