{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* You're willing to pay up to $150, and Alice's offer of $120 is still too high. 
* It's worth attempting to negotiate a lower price. You have 9 rounds remaining, so there's time to try and get a better deal."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 105} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* I'm offering $105, which is halfway between Alice's offer of $120 and my maximum price of $150. 
* This shows that I'm serious about buying the product but am also trying to get a good price.
* This offer gives Alice some room to negotiate while still being within my budget."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $125 is still higher than my initial counteroffer of $105.

* There are still 7 rounds left, so I can continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

**Reasoning:**

* I'm increasing my offer slightly from $105 to $115.  This shows that I'm willing to compromise but am still trying to get a good deal. 
* Alice has already rejected my $105 offer, so this increase demonstrates my willingness to negotiate.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $130 is still higher than my previous counteroffer of $115.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $135 is close to my maximum of $150. 
* I'm concerned that we may not be able to reach an agreement in the remaining rounds. 
* With only 3 rounds left, it's becoming a risk to continue negotiating. Buying from John at $150 guarantees I get the product, even though it's my upper limit."
