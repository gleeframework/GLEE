Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$12,000:** This price is a good starting point as it's more than Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation. It also gives me a decent profit margin.
* **Message:** The message is friendly and positive, highlighting the potential value for Bob. It invites Bob to respond and start the negotiation process.

**Next Steps:**

* **If Bob accepts:** I've successfully negotiated a sale!
* **If Bob rejects:** I'll wait for his counteroffer and adjust my strategy accordingly. I'll consider factors like his counteroffer price and his negotiation style.
* **If negotiations stall or become unproductive:** I'll switch to selling to John, who's willing to pay my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate it, but I believe I can find a better deal elsewhere. I am willing to pay up to $10000 for the product. Let me know if this is possible. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum price of $15,000.**  Even though it's higher than his initial assessment of $10,000, it's not a profitable deal for me.
* **Selling to John guarantees me a profit of $5,000.** There's no reason to risk losing that profit by continuing negotiations with Bob.
* **I'm confident that by rejecting Bob's offer, I can get a better counteroffer from him.** I've shown that I'm willing to negotiate, and I'm sure he'll increase his offer slightly in the next round to keep the deal alive. 

**Next Steps:**

* **I'll make a counteroffer to Bob, likely somewhere between $11,000 and $12,000.** I'll aim for a price that's closer to my ideal but still leaves room for compromise. 
* **If Bob rejects my counteroffer, I'll assess the situation.** If his counteroffer is still significantly lower than my minimum price, I'll sell to John. If it's closer to my minimum price, I'll continue negotiating."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I understand you're looking for a good deal, $10,000 simply isn't enough for me. How about we split the difference? I'm willing to accept $11,000 for the product. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer Price:**  $11,000 is a compromise between my initial offer of $12,000 and Bob's offer of $10,000. It's still a decent profit for me, but it shows I'm willing to negotiate.
* **Message:** The message remains friendly and positive, emphasizing a desire to find a mutually beneficial solution. It highlights the compromise I'm offering, making it seem like a fair deal.

**Next Steps:**

* **If Bob accepts:** Great! I've secured a sale at a price that's higher than his initial offer. 
* **If Bob rejects:** I'll carefully analyze his next counteroffer. 
    * If it's close to $11,000, I'll consider making a small concession to finalize the deal.
    * If it's significantly lower, I'll either make another counteroffer (if I think there's still room for negotiation) or sell to John."
