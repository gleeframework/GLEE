"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $950,000 is less than Alice's valuation, it's still above Bob's limit.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is offering a price that's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer but still higher than what John is offering. This is a reasonable starting point for negotiation, demonstrating Bob's willingness to compromise while still aiming for a substantial discount."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice has come down in price, it's still above Bob's limit.  It's worth continuing to negotiate in hopes of getting a lower price, but Bob needs to keep in mind that he can always buy from John for $800,000 if the negotiations fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 875000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is increasing his offer slightly from the previous round, showing a willingness to compromise.  $875,000 is still a good deal for Bob compared to Alice's initial offer, and it's a step closer to what John is offering, but still a significant discount for Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is still higher than Bob's limit, and it's not clear if she's willing to negotiate further. While it might be tempting to accept, the risk of not finding a better price outweighs the potential gains. Bob should continue negotiating to see if he can reach a mutually acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 890000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is now offering a price that's only $35,000 more than what John is offering. This is a significant concession from Bob's previous offer, but still leaves some room for negotiation.  The goal is to see if Alice will meet him halfway, recognizing that she's likely to lose the deal if she doesn't."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $910,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $910,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is still above Bob's limit.  It's a bit closer, but there's still room for negotiation. Bob has already shown a willingness to compromise, and with only three rounds left, he needs to push for a better deal.  It's risky, but with only a small amount of money separating the two parties, a counteroffer might be the best way to close the deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 895000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is making a final push, offering a price that's almost exactly halfway between his last offer and Alice's.  This signals a strong desire to close the deal, while still demonstrating that he's not willing to go above his limit. With only two rounds left, this is a risky move, but it could be enough to convince Alice to accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $905,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $905,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is still too high for Bob. While there is only one round left, it is unlikely that Alice will come down further.  It's better for Bob to buy from John, securing a price that's within his budget and avoiding the risk of not closing a deal."
