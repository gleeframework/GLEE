"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I know you're interested in. My starting price is $110. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 
 
I'm starting at $110, which is a bit above my minimum value of $100 but still leaves room for negotiation. I'm hoping Bob will find this offer reasonable enough to start the discussion."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for reaching out. I appreciate your offer, but I am looking to keep my spending within $80. Would you consider reducing the price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $100. While I'd prefer to sell to Bob, I'm not willing to accept such a low price.  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $80 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $95. This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to make a deal.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

I'm counteroffering at $95, which is closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum price. I'm hoping this will be a good middle ground that encourages Bob to accept the deal."
