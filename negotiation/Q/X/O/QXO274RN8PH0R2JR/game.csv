"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,300,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  Considering the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $1,100,000.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I understand your position, $1,100,000 is simply too low for me. The value of this product is significant, and I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  Let's compromise. I'm willing to lower my price to $1,250,000. This is a fair offer that reflects the product's worth.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. $1,250,000 is still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $1,200,000? That's a fair price for both of us, and we can finalize the deal.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
