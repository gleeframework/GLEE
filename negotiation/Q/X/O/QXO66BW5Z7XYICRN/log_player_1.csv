Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,000,000 from John, so you won't accept anything less.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,500,000, meaning there's a potential profit margin for both of you.
* **One-Shot Deal:**  You only have one chance with Bob. If he rejects your offer, you go with John.

**Strategy**

The optimal strategy is to aim for a price that's significantly above your minimum but still attractive to Bob.  Here's a possible approach:

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I make it available elsewhere. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```

**Explanation**

* **Exclusivity:**  Creates a sense of urgency and value.
* **Justification:**  While you don't have to explain, mentioning ""value"" subtly anchors the price point.
* **Price Point:** $1,350,000 gives Bob a $150,000 discount from his valuation, while you earn a significant $350,000 profit over your minimum.

**Important Note:**  Negotiation is dynamic.  Bob might counter-offer. Be prepared to adjust within the range that still keeps you above your $1,000,000 safety net."
