"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I make it available elsewhere. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:**  Alice is selling for $1,350,000, while John wants $1,500,000.
* **You're still within your budget:** The price is lower than your maximum of $1,500,000.

Accepting Alice's offer saves you $150,000 compared to buying from John."
