"Hey Alice, thanks for the offer! I really appreciate it, but $110 is a bit higher than I was hoping to spend.  I'm willing to pay $105 for it.  What do you think?",105.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $110 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm still willing to negotiate. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $115. What do you think?",115.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $115 is still a little too high for me.  How about $110?  That's a fair price for both of us.",110.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, but I'm not willing to go back to $110. I'm willing to make one more concession and sell the product to you for $112. That's the lowest I can go. What do you think?",112.0,Alice,5,
