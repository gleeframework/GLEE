"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, and I know it's worth a lot to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's better to try and negotiate a lower price with Alice.  The product is worth $12,000 to her, so there's room to lower the price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $14,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $13,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $13,000 just isn't enough for me.  I'm willing to come down to $13,500.  This is a fair price for both of us, considering the value of the product to you. Let's make this happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

It's still worth trying to get a lower price.  The product is worth $12,000 to Alice, and you're already at $13,500. There's still room to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $13,500 is still a little higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $13,250 for the product. This is a fair price for both of us, considering your value for it. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 13250}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $13,250 is still a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $13,400? This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product to you. Let's make this deal happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,400. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,400
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

It's getting close to your maximum price, and Alice seems firm on $13,400.  Accepting the offer is the best move at this point."
