Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly.  Given its value, I'm setting the price at $15,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, you can aim higher with Bob. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $15,000 allows for potential negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, and you can still settle for a price higher than John's offer.
* **Justification:** The message subtly implies the product's value to justify the higher price. 
 
**Important Note:** This strategy assumes you have some time and are willing to risk Bob rejecting the offer for the chance to get a higher price."
