"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's worth at least $1,000,000 to me, and I'm confident it would be worth the same to you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,050,000. This is a one-time opportunity, and I'm sure you'll find it beneficial. Please let me know your decision. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is above your maximum price:** You're willing to pay a maximum of $1,000,000, and Alice is asking for $1,050,000.
* **You have a backup option:** You know John will sell you the product for $1,000,000. 

By rejecting Alice's offer, you can try to negotiate a lower price or simply buy from John at your desired price point."
