Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a possible offer, considering Alice's goals:

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I believe a price of $1,400,000 is fair. This offer stands for 24 hours."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to Bob's $1,500,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $1,400,000 leaves some space for Bob to counter-offer if he wants to, potentially pushing the final price higher. 
* **Time Pressure:** The 24-hour limit adds a sense of urgency, potentially making Bob act quicker.
* **Alternative Option:** Alice has a safety net with John's offer of $1,200,000.  This allows her to be firmer in her negotiation with Bob.

**Important Considerations:**

* This is just one strategy. A more aggressive approach might start with a higher price, but risk Bob rejecting outright.
* Alice could tailor her message to highlight the specific aspects of the product that make it valuable to Bob, potentially justifying the high price."
