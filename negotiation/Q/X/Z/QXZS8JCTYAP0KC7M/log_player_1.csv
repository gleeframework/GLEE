"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $110. It's a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum value ($100). This allows some room for negotiation while still ensuring I'm getting a good price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate it, but I believe I can find a better deal elsewhere. I am willing to pay $95 for your product. Please let me know if this is acceptable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because $95 is still below my minimum acceptable value of $100.  I'm willing to negotiate further, but I won't sell below my minimum price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $95 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $105.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I still feel that $95 would be a fair price for the product. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob is still stubbornly sticking to his $95 offer. While it's tempting to sell to John for $100, I'm going to keep negotiating with Bob for a bit longer. There's still a chance I can get a slightly better price, and I'm not ready to give up just yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but I need to make at least $100 on this.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $100.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I don't want to lose this opportunity."", ""product_price"": 100}
