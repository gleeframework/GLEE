Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $950,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $1,050,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the value I place on the product. I'm confident you'll find it's a great deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.

* **John's offer is a safer bet.**  You can buy the product from John for a price you're comfortable with. 
* **Negotiation is still possible.** Alice is showing a willingness to negotiate, and you might be able to reach a mutually acceptable price in the following rounds.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,050,000.  I'm willing to go up to $1,025,000. This is a significant compromise from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price given the value we both see in this product.  Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1025000} 
```
