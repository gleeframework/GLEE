"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $950,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to save a bit more.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  I think this is a fair price considering its value to both of us.  What do you think?",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your desire to save a bit more, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $900,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and my initial offer of $950,000. I'm confident you'll find this offer reasonable.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  $900,000 is closer, but I'm still hoping to get it for $875,000.  This is still a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.  Let's see if we can make this happen.",875000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to work towards a deal. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $875,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $885,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let's see if we can finalize the deal at this price.",885000.0,Alice,5,
