"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a fantastic product that I believe would be incredibly valuable to you. I'm offering it to you at a price that I think is fair and allows you to benefit from its worth.  Let me know if you're interested and we can discuss the details further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $14,000 is less than your maximum budget of $15,000 and cheaper than buying from John. Accepting this offer saves you $1,000."
