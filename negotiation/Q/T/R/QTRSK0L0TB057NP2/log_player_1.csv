"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 20000} 

I'm starting high, knowing the product is worth at least $15,000 to me. This gives me room to negotiate and potentially earn more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. $10,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17000}
```

I'm offering $17,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still above my minimum price. I'm hoping Bob will see it as a fair price and accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $11,500 is getting closer to my minimum, it's still not enough.  I'm going to counteroffer again, hoping to bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 16000}
```

I'm lowering my offer again to $16,000. This is a significant concession, but I'm still confident that I can get a better price than John's offer.  I'm hoping Bob will see this as a fair deal and accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

The negotiation is getting frustrating. While Bob is slowly increasing his offer, it's still not close to my minimum price.  I don't want to waste more time with this.  I'm going to sell to John. I can get a decent price and move on."
