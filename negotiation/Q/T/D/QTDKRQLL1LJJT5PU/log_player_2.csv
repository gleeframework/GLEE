(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is too high. You can likely get a better price by negotiating. It's worth exploring the counteroffer option before considering buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial price, but still above her minimum acceptable price. This gives me room to negotiate further while also showing that I'm serious about buying the product."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high. While it's closer to my target price, there's still room for negotiation. I'll try to make another counteroffer and see if we can reach a mutually acceptable price before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly, showing I'm willing to compromise, but still keeping it below Alice's latest offer. This keeps the negotiation moving and could lead to a quicker agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,320,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,320,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting closer to my target price, and we're nearing the midpoint of our negotiation rounds. While I could continue negotiating, accepting this offer is a good compromise. It saves me $180,000 compared to buying from John, and it's likely we won't get much closer in these remaining rounds."
