"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $10,000 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $11,500? This would be a great deal for both of us.",11500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I'm getting closer to your price, but $11,500 is still a bit more than I had in mind. How about we meet in the middle at $10,750?",10750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but I can't go any lower than $11,250. This is still a fair price for both of us, and it leaves some room for us to agree. What do you say?",11250.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, this is getting quite close, but I'm afraid I can't quite meet your price.  How about $11,000, my final offer?",11000.0,Bob,6,
