{""product_price"": 20000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $20,000. This is a good starting point as it's higher than my minimum value but leaves room for negotiation. I'll gauge Bob's interest and adjust my strategy based on his response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $5,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $5,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Bob's offer is far too low, and I'm not willing to sell it for that price. I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

I'm offering $10,000. This is a compromise that's still significantly higher than Bob's offer but shows I'm willing to negotiate.  I'm hoping this will encourage him to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low.  While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm not willing to go lower than my minimum value of $15,000.  It's time to move on and sell the product to John."
