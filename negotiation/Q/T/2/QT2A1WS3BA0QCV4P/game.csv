"Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this product. Its value is truly exceptional, and I believe it would be a significant asset to you.  Given its worth, I'm asking for $1,800,000.  What are your thoughts?",1800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,800,000 is far beyond my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product, which is still a fair price given its value to you. I'm confident this is a win-win scenario for both of us.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but the product's value is truly significant. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $1,000,000 is too low. How about we meet in the middle at $1,400,000?",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,400,000 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's split the difference and settle on $1,200,000.  This price reflects the value of the product to both of us and allows for a fair transaction.",1200000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find a compromise.  Let's make this happen â€“ how about $1,300,000?",1300000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I'm getting closer to your desired price, but $1,300,000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm confident we can find a middle ground. How about $1,250,000? This offer is fair to both of us and allows for a successful deal.",1250000.0,Bob,6,
