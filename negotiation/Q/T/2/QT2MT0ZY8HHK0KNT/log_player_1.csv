Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm starting high, aiming to get as much as possible.  While the product is worth $10,000 to me, I'm hoping Bob will be willing to pay a premium since it's worth $8,000 to him. This gives him room to negotiate down."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting to take the $8,500, it's still below my minimum value. I'm going to try and negotiate a higher price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

I'm counteroffering at $9,500. This is a significant step down from my initial offer but still above Bob's offer. It leaves some room for further negotiation, but it's closer to my minimum value."
