It's not worth buying from Alice for $11,000 when you can get it from John for $8,000.  Rejecting her offer allows you to try to negotiate a lower price."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

This offer is still below your maximum budget but offers Alice a chance to make some profit while still being lower than her initial asking price."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

Alice is now offering a price that is closer to my maximum budget, but it's still above what I'm willing to pay. It's more advantageous to buy from John at $8,000, ensuring I get the best possible price within my budget."
