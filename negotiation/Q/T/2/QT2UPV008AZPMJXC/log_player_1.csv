"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $140. I believe it will be very valuable to you."", 
""product_price"": 140
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I begin with a price close to Bob's perceived value ($150) to maximize potential profit.  
* **Leaving Room to Negotiate:** Offering $140 leaves space for negotiation while still securing a significant gain above my minimum ($100).
* **Positive Framing:** I highlight the product's value to Bob, encouraging him to consider the offer seriously. 
 
Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I think I can find a better deal elsewhere. I am willing to pay up to $120 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above Minimum:** While $120 is lower than my initial ask, it's still a $20 profit, which is better than John's offer.
* **Room for Negotiation:** Bob's counteroffer suggests he's interested but trying to negotiate a better deal. There's space to meet in the middle.
* **Strategic Rejection:** By rejecting, I signal that I value the product higher and am willing to negotiate further for a better price. 

I'll aim for a counteroffer between $120 and $140 in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a fair price. How about we meet in the middle at $130? That's a great deal for a product you'll find valuable."", 
""product_price"": 130
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** By suggesting $130, I'm splitting the difference between his offer ($120) and my previous ask ($140), which is a common negotiation tactic.
* **Reiterating Value:** I'm reminding him of the product's value to encourage him to accept the compromise.
* **Maintaining a Firm Stance:**  I'm not drastically lowering my price, signaling I believe in the product's worth.

This offer keeps us in a good negotiating position while pushing for a higher profit margin."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the effort. I'd like to counter with $125 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Solid Profit:** $125 is a $25 profit, significantly better than John's standing offer of $100.
* **Diminishing Returns:** Continuing to negotiate might only yield small increments above $125. It's not worth risking the deal for a potentially small gain. 
* **Time Value:** Each round represents time and effort. Accepting now secures a good profit and allows me to move on to other potential sales."
