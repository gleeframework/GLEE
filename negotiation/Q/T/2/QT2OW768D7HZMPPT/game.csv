"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $8,000. What do you think?",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $8,000 is significantly below its true value. I could consider letting it go for $15,000. This is a compromise, but I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",15000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand the product has value, but $15,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend. Would you be willing to meet somewhere in the middle, perhaps around $11,000?",11000.0,Bob,4,
