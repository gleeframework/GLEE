"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $130. I believe it will be highly valuable to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better for you than buying from John.** You'd pay $130 instead of $150.
* **It's also better for Alice.** She's getting $130, which is more than her $80 valuation."
