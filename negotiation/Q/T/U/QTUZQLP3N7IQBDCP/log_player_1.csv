``` 

This offer starts with a price point that is higher than Bob's perceived value, giving room for negotiation.  It also leaves room for a potential counteroffer from Bob, without immediately jumping to the John offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I am able to pay $950,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While it's closer to my minimum, I'm confident I can do better with a counteroffer."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer. While I value your interest,  $950,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $975,000. This reflects the value of the product and allows for a mutually beneficial deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 975000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I understand the value of the product to you, but I believe we can find a middle ground. I would like to propose $960,000 as the price for the product. I hope this proposal is acceptable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $960,000.

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While it's not my ideal price, it's closer to my minimum and  saves the time and potential hassle of further negotiation. I also don't want to risk losing Bob as a buyer and then having to start over with someone new."
