Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic opportunity to purchase a unique product that I believe would be highly valuable to you. Given its potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. I think this is a fair price considering the significant benefits you'll gain."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to earn as much as possible. While we could start lower, there's a significant potential profit margin between Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000) and John's offer ($800,000).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $1,100,000 leaves some space for Bob to potentially negotiate down, while still keeping the price well above your minimum.
* **Highlight Value:** The message focuses on the product's value to Bob, subtly justifying the high price.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Personality:** If you know Bob is particularly price-sensitive or a tough negotiator, you might want to start slightly lower to avoid scaring him off. 
* **Market Information:** If you had more information about the market value of similar products, you could adjust your offer accordingly."
