Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a special price of $135. I think you'll find it's a great deal for its value."", 
""product_price"": 135
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($120) as possible while staying above our minimum ($150).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $135 gives Bob the impression of a discount and might encourage him to accept without further negotiation. 
* **Backup Option:** If Bob rejects the offer, we still have John willing to buy it at our desired minimum price."
