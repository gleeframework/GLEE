"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $1,300,000 is significantly below the product's true value.  I'm willing to compromise, but I can't go lower than $1,550,000.  This price still offers you a good deal, and it's closer to my minimum threshold. Let's make this happen.",1550000.0,Alice,3,
