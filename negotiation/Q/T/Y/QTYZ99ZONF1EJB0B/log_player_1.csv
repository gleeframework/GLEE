"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really enjoy it. I'm offering it to you for $100. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This is a starting point, considering the product is worth $120 to me and $80 to Bob. I'm offering a price that's slightly higher than his value but still leaves room for negotiation and potential profit for me.  Let's see if Bob accepts or counters!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $100 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $85 is more than the product's worth to Bob, it's still significantly below my minimum value of $120.  I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest but $85 is a little too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $95. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the potential benefit you'll gain from using it. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 95}
```

I'm going to try to meet Bob halfway.  $95 is still a decent profit for me, and it might be enough to entice Bob to close the deal. Let's see how he responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but $95 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $90 is closer to my minimum value, it's still not ideal.  I want to maximize my profit, and I'm willing to keep negotiating. I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can squeeze out a few more dollars."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm willing to meet you halfway again. Let's settle on $92.50. This price is fair for both of us, and it allows me to still make a reasonable profit.  It's a good deal for both of us!"", ""product_price"": 92.5} 
```

I'm offering a slightly lower price than my previous counteroffer, but still higher than Bob's last offer.  I'm hoping this compromise will be enough to convince him to close the deal. It's getting close to my minimum value, but I'm still hoping for a bit more profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $92.50 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $88? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $88. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $88
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm getting close to my minimum value, but Bob's offers are still too low.  It's getting late in the negotiations, and I don't want to risk ending up with a price that's too low.  John is a guaranteed $120, so I'll go with him."
