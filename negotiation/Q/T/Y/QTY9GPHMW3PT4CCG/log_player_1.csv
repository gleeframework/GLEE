"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
```

I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum value ($100) to leave room for negotiation.  I'm aiming for a price that Bob might consider, but which is also beneficial for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $100.  I will counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

I'm lowering my price to $100, which is my absolute minimum.  This is still a better deal for me than selling to John for the same price. I'm hoping that Bob will see that he can get a better deal from me than from John, and he'll accept."
