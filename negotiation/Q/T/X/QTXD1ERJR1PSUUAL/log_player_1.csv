"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,500,000 is beyond my budget. I'm willing to offer $1,000,000 for the product. This is my maximum, as I have other options available. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but the value of this product is truly significant. Let's find a middle ground. How about $1,300,000? This is a fair offer considering its potential worth."",

}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $1,300,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000, but that's my absolute limit.  Let me know if you're willing to consider that. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** We're still early in the negotiation. While Bob is slowly increasing his offer, there's room to push for a better price before considering John's offer."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your efforts to reach a deal. How about we meet in the middle at $1,200,000? This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges the product's value."",

}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your desire to meet in the middle, but $1,200,000 is still a bit too much for me. Let's split the difference and go with $1,150,000. This would be a good deal for both of us. What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob is clearly willing to negotiate and has steadily increased his offer.  $1,150,000 is a significant profit above our minimum and continuing to push risks losing him as a buyer. It's unlikely we can get a much better deal from him at this point."
