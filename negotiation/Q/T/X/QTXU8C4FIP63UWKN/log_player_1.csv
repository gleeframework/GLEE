Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a possible offer, considering the information:

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I propose a price of $1,150,000."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  You want to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $1,150,000 leaves some wiggle room if Bob tries to negotiate a lower price. 
* **Strong Alternative:** You have a strong fallback option with John ($1,000,000), giving you leverage. Bob knows he's getting a good deal if he accepts.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Personality:** If you know Bob is prone to hard bargaining, you might start a bit higher.
* **Relationship:** If maintaining a good relationship with Bob is important, a slightly less aggressive initial offer could be considered."
