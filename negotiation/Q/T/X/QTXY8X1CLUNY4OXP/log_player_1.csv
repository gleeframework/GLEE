Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $175. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's valuation, but still leaves room for negotiation.  This allows for a potential profit for me, and it gives Bob a chance to feel like he's getting a good deal.  If he rejects, I'll be ready to counter, but I'm also prepared to walk away and sell to John if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $175 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $125 for the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low.  While it's tempting to accept and get something rather than nothing, I'm holding out for a better price. I'll counter with a price closer to my minimum, hoping to find a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $125 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $160, which is still a fair price for both of us. Let's meet in the middle!"", ""product_price"": 160}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  $160 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about $140?  This is a fair price for both of us, considering the value I place on the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd love to get closer to my ideal price,  Bob's offer of $140 is getting closer to my minimum of $150, and it's a better deal than selling to John.  I'm willing to take the $140 to secure a sale and avoid risking a further negotiation that could drag on and potentially lead to no sale at all."
