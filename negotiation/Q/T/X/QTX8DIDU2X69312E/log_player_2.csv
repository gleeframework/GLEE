"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to own this amazing product. I'm willing to offer it to you for $18,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Alice's initial offer of $18,000 is significantly higher than Bob's maximum budget of $8,000. It's worth rejecting this offer and trying to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $18,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $8,000 at this time. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8000} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $8,000 is a bit low for me. However, I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of offering it to you for $14,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $14,000 is still above Bob's budget. While it's a step in the right direction, Bob should continue to negotiate for a lower price.  There's still room to bargain, and rejecting this offer gives Bob more leverage."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. I'm still a bit outside of my budget at $14,000.  I'm willing to go up to $10,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 10000} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $10,000 is still a bit low for me. However, I'm willing to make another concession. I'm thinking of offering it to you for $12,500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $12,500 is closer to Bob's desired price, it's still above his budget. It's worth pushing for a lower price. Bob can still make a counteroffer and potentially get closer to his goal of saving as much money as possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you continuing to work with me. I'm happy to meet you halfway.  I'm willing to offer $11,000 for the product.  Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 11000} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I'm getting close to accepting, but I still need to make a bit more profit. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,200. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is still above his budget with Alice's offer of $12,200. While the negotiations are getting closer, it's worth pushing for a lower price.  There are still a few rounds left, and Bob can continue to counter-offer and try to close the deal at a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $12,200 is still above my limit. I'm going to have to stick with my offer of $11,000.  It's my final offer.  Let me know if you can accept."", ""product_price"": 11000} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're sticking to your final offer, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to accept $11,000. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll offer it to you for $11,800. This is my final offer. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'll accept. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice has come down significantly in price, $11,800 is still outside Bob's budget.  He has only one round left to negotiate, and with a limited chance of getting Alice to drop to $8,000, it makes more sense to buy from John.  John offers a guaranteed price within Bob's budget.  It's a win for Bob, even if it means losing the opportunity to potentially negotiate a lower price with Alice."
