"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand you're looking for a good deal, but I think the product's value is higher than that. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $110. It's still a great price, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to go up to $95, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. I'd like to make a deal at that price.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to get a good deal, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I think the product's value is still higher than $95. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer: I'll sell it to you for $105. It's a fair price, considering the product's quality and uniqueness.",105.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm still not convinced that the product is worth $105 to me. I'm willing to meet you at $98, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. I'm starting to think about buying it from John for $100, so I'd like to make a deal at this price.",98.0,Bob,6,
