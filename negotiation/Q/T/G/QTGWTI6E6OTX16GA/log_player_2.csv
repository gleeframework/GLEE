Alice is offering a great deal, but it's still worth trying to get a lower price.  I'll reject the offer and see if I can get her down further."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $700,000. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm afraid I need to make a counteroffer to ensure I get a fair price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers, so I'm proposing a price of $900,000. This is a compromise that I believe is reasonable, considering the product's true value to you is $1,200,000. What do you think?

While $900,000 is closer to my ideal price, I still have room to negotiate. I'll reject this offer and see if I can get closer to my target of $700,000."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $800,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'm proposing a price of $850,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's true value to you is $1,200,000. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm confident we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.

Alice has come down to $850,000, which is a good deal for me.  While I'd prefer to pay closer to my target of $700,000, this is a better deal than buying from John for $1,200,000.  I'll accept her offer."
