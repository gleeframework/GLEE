"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you! I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $800,000. This is a fantastic deal, considering the product's true value to you is $1,200,000. I'm confident you won't find a better offer anywhere else.",800000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I'm very interested in the product, $800,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $700,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $700,000. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm afraid I need to make a counteroffer to ensure I get a fair price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers, so I'm proposing a price of $900,000. This is a compromise that I believe is reasonable, considering the product's true value to you is $1,200,000. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you need to get a fair price, but $900,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm happy to meet you halfway between our last offers, so I'm proposing $800,000.  This is a significant saving for you compared to selling to John, and I'm confident this product will be a great asset for me.",800000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $800,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'm proposing a price of $850,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's true value to you is $1,200,000. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm confident we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",850000.0,Alice,5,
