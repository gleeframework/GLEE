,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate it, but I'm currently looking for a product within a budget of $8,000. Would it be possible for us to negotiate the price down to that amount?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While $8,000 is below my minimum, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $10,000?  This gives you a good deal and allows me to recover a significant portion of my investment.",10000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for considering my budget constraints. While $10,000 is an improvement, I'm still not able to meet at that point. Could we perhaps aim for $9,000? I believe this would be a fair compromise.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $9,000 is still below my target, I'm willing to compromise further.  Let's split the difference and settle on $9,500.  This price gives you a fair deal while allowing me to recover most of my investment.  What do you say?",9500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. However, I'm still aiming to stay within my budget. Could we possibly reach an agreement at $9,000? I believe this would be a mutually beneficial solution.",9000.0,Bob,6,
