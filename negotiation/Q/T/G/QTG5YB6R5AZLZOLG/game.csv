"Thank you for the offer, Alice! I'm definitely interested, but $15000 is a bit higher than my budget. Would you be willing to consider $12000? I'm confident this is still a fair price for the unique item you have.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand that $12000 is a bit lower than my initial price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $13500. This is a great compromise that still reflects the product's value, and I think you'll be happy with the price.",13500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  $13500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about $13000?  This is a good compromise, and I'm confident we can reach a deal that works for both of us.",13000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $13000 is still a bit above your budget, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $13250. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",13250.0,Alice,5,
