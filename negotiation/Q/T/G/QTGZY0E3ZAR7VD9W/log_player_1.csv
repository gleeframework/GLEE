I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum to see if Bob is willing to negotiate."

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json

$100 is significantly less than my minimum price. I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a mutually acceptable price."

I'm lowering my price a bit, but still above my minimum, to see if Bob is willing to come up."

While $110 is closer to my minimum, it's still below what I'm willing to accept. I'll make another counteroffer to see if we can bridge the gap."

I'm coming down to $120, which is still slightly above my minimum.  I'm hoping Bob will agree to this price, as it's getting close to the value he's willing to pay."

Bob is getting closer, but I'm not comfortable going any lower than my minimum.  It's time to take the guaranteed $150 from John."
