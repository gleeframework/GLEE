Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too high for me. Would you consider $7,000?"",

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,000 is significantly lower than what I'm willing to accept.  I'm willing to come down to $8,500, recognizing the value it holds for you.  Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  How about we split the difference from our last offers and settle at $7,750?"",
""product_price"": 7750
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but $7,750 is still below my minimum. I'm willing to go down to $8,250.  This is a fair price considering the value you place on the product. Let's aim for a swift resolution. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** While Alice is slowly coming down, it's unlikely she'll reach a price significantly better than John's $8,000 offer in the remaining rounds. Accepting her current offer would mean overpaying by $250. Buying from John guarantees the best price without further negotiation risk."
