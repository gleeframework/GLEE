{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find very valuable. I'm willing to offer it to you for $130. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 130}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $150.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $80. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $130 leaves room for Bob to potentially negotiate you down, while still ensuring a significant profit if he accepts the initial offer. 

**Strategy:**  This offer aims to capture a large portion of the value difference between your minimum and Bob's maximum while still making the deal attractive enough for him to accept outright."
