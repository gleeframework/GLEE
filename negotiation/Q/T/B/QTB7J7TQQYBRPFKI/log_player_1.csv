"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000.  It's a unique opportunity to acquire a valuable asset.  Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum desired value ($1,000,000) to leave room for negotiation.
* **Leaving Room for Compromise:**  The price is also below Bob's maximum value ($800,000), so there's potential for a deal to be struck. 
* **Positive Tone:**  The message is positive and emphasizes the value of the product, hoping to encourage Bob to consider the offer seriously."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering its value to me and your need to sell it quickly. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum desired value.**  I'm aiming for at least $1,000,000. 
* **There are still rounds left.**  I'm not desperate to sell immediately. I can try to negotiate a better price with Bob.
* **Selling to John is a viable option if the negotiation fails.** This gives me a safety net. 

**Next Steps:**  I will counteroffer Bob with a price closer to my desired value, but still lower than his offer. I need to strike a balance between pushing for a good price and risking losing the deal entirely."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I need to stay closer to my asking price.  How about $1,050,000? That's still a significant discount from my original price, and it allows for some room for us to find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer Closer to My Value:**  I've lowered my price from $1,200,000 to $1,050,000, which is still above my minimum desired value of $1,000,000.
* **Maintain Leverage:**  I'm not dropping my price drastically yet, hoping to convince Bob that I'm serious about getting a good price. 
* **Signal Willingness to Negotiate:**  The message emphasizes that I'm willing to compromise and find a middle ground.
* **Room for Further Negotiation:** There's still room for Bob to counteroffer, so the negotiation can continue."

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $1,050,000 is still too high for me. Let's meet in the middle. I'm offering $900,000. This price is fair and allows us both to walk away with a good deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000

* **I have several rounds left.**  There's still time to try and negotiate a better price. 
* **Selling to John is a viable option, but I'm not desperate.**  I'm hopeful that I can get closer to my desired price with Bob.

**Next Steps:** I'll make a counteroffer that's closer to Bob's offer, but still higher than my minimum. I need to find a price that both parties are comfortable with, and I'm willing to compromise to some extent."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. Let's see if we can bridge the gap.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000.  This would allow me to meet my minimum needs and still provide you with a fair deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

Round 6

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **We're nearing the middle ground.**  I'm hopeful that we can bridge the remaining gap in the next few rounds.
* **Selling to John is still an option if needed.** I don't want to rush into a deal that's not advantageous for me.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're almost there! Let's close this deal. I'm willing to accept $935,000.  This is a compromise on my part, but it also ensures that I meet my minimum target.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 935000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Increase:** I'm increasing my offer slightly to $935,000, showing that I'm willing to meet Bob halfway, but not completely compromising my minimum.
* **Emphasis on Finality:** The message suggests a sense of urgency and finality, implying that this might be the last offer I'm willing to make.
* **Framing it as a Compromise:** I'm emphasizing that this is a compromise on my part, making it seem like a generous offer that Bob should consider accepting.

**Next Steps:** With only a few rounds remaining, I'm getting closer to my minimum price. I need to be careful not to be too inflexible, but also not to settle for less than what I consider fair."
