Round 4
Bob's offer:

We're still significantly above John's offer, and we have time to negotiate. Bob is moving closer to our desired range."

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above $1,110,000. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1,050,000 is still a bit too high, so I'll try to meet you in the middle at $1,075,000.

{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is getting closer to our acceptable range, we still have some negotiating room. He's moving in smaller increments, which suggests he's getting closer to his maximum. We're willing to let go of some potential profit to ensure we get a deal significantly better than John's offer."

Round 7

Round 8
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,060,000. 
You have three options:

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While we could likely push for a bit more, Bob has consistently moved upward in his offers. At $1,060,000, we're getting a significant profit over John's offer ($260,000 more). The risk of Bob walking away and losing out on this deal outweighs the potential of gaining another $10-20k."
