"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,150,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. This price is fair considering your desired selling price and my maximum budget. Let's see if we can reach a mutually agreeable deal.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position and appreciate your offer. However, $1,050,000 is still a bit low for me.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.  This price reflects the value of the product to you while still allowing me to make a profit. I believe this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us. ",1100000.0,Alice,3,
