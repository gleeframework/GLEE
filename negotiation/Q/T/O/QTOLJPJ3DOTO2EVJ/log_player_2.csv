# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,150,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you, and I'm confident this deal will be mutually beneficial. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,150,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. This price is fair considering your desired selling price and my maximum budget. Let's see if we can reach a mutually agreeable deal."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position and appreciate your offer. However, $1,050,000 is still a bit low for me.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.  This price reflects the value of the product to you while still allowing me to make a profit. I believe this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has come down to $1,100,000, which is closer to Bob's desired price of $1,050,000.  This is a good deal for Bob as it's still cheaper than buying from John. There is a risk that further negotiation could result in a lower price, but there's also the risk that Alice could walk away.  Accepting this offer is a good compromise and secures the product at a reasonable price."
