"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really love.  I'm asking for $140 for it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I want to start with a price that's close to Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive message:**  A friendly tone can help build rapport and make Bob more receptive to the offer. 
* **Focus on value:**  Highlighting the product's desirability can make Bob more willing to pay a higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. That's a bit steep for me, though. Would you consider $110? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:** $110 is below my minimum acceptable price of $120. 
* **Room for negotiation:** While I could sell to John for $120, there's still room for a higher price with Bob. He clearly values the product at $150, so I believe we can find a middle ground. 
* **Strategic counteroffer:** Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to make a counteroffer and potentially get a price closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $110 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $130.  It's a great deal for you, and it still allows me to get a fair price for the product.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 130}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** I'm offering a price that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer, showing flexibility and a willingness to compromise.
* **Reinforcing value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to him, emphasizing that my offer is still a good deal.
* **Positive tone:** Using a friendly and encouraging tone can help maintain a positive negotiating atmosphere."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're looking for a fair price, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $120? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Minimum price reached:** Bob's offer of $120 matches my minimum acceptable price. 
* **No further negotiation needed:**  I don't see a way to get a higher price from Bob, and there's no point in risking losing him altogether.
* **Guaranteed sale:** Accepting Bob's offer guarantees a sale and avoids the risk of rejecting him and ending up selling to John for the same price."
