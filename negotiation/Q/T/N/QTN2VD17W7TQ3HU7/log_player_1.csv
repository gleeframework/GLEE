Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $15,000. I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase the product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $15,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $17,500?"",

}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $17,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $16,000, but that's as high as I can go. I'm really interested in this product, but I need to make it work within my means. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While I could push for more, accepting $16,000 is a good deal at this point. It's a solid profit above my minimum, and continuing the negotiation carries the risk of Bob lowering his offer or walking away."
