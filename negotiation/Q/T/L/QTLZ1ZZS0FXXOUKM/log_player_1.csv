``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $140. This is a good starting point as it's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price, but still leaves room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json

While $120 is more than selling to John, I believe I can still get closer to my ideal price. I will reject Bob's offer and counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
```

I'm lowering my price to $130, but I'm still holding firm on getting a price closer to my initial offer. This shows Bob I'm serious about selling to him, but I'm not willing to give up too much."
