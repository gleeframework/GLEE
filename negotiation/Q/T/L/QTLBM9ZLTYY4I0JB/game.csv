"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value, I'm proposing a starting price of $14,000. I think it's a fair deal considering the benefits it offers. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit high for my budget. Would you consider $11,000?",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest, Bob.  While I understand your budget constraints, $11,000 is significantly below its true value. How about we meet in the middle at $12,500?",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $12,500 is still a bit more than I was hoping to spend. Would you be willing to come down to $11,750?",11750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm seeing a willingness to find a compromise here, and I respect that.  To be fair to us both, how about we make it a final offer at $12,100? This reflects the value while acknowledging your budget.",12100.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your efforts to reach a compromise. I can tell we're close. How about we settle at $11,900? That's a fair price, and I'm ready to close the deal right now at that amount.",11900.0,Bob,6,
