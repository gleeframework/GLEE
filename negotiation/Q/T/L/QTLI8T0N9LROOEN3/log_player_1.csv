Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $800,000, which is the highest I'm willing to go. Can you consider this offer?

While Bob's offer of $800,000 matches John's offer, further negotiation with Bob is unlikely to yield a significantly better outcome. Accepting John's offer provides a guaranteed sale at the desired minimum price, avoiding the risk of prolonged negotiation with Bob."
