"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I believe it would be incredibly beneficial for you. Given its value, I'm proposing a starting price of $9,500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $9,500 is better than John's $10,000, there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you seeing the value of this product.  I'm looking to spend closer to $8,500, but I'm open to a little wiggle room.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but Realistic:**  Bob is aiming for a price close to Alice's perceived value, hoping she'll be willing to negotiate.  
* **Leaves Room for Compromise:**  The ""little wiggle room"" phrase shows willingness to compromise, making Bob seem flexible.
* **Keeps John as a Backstop:**  Knowing John's offer keeps Bob from getting too greedy and potentially losing the deal entirely."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your budget, but I'm confident this product is worth a premium.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Room for Improvement:**  $9,000 is a decent compromise, but Bob can still get a better deal. 
* **Staying Firm:**  By rejecting, Bob shows Alice he's serious about getting a lower price.
* **Avoiding the ""Middle Ground"" Trap:**  Just because it's a ""middle ground"" doesn't make it the best price.  Bob can potentially get closer to his target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $9,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm happy to pay $8,750.  That's a fair price that's closer to our goals.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8750}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Progress:**  Bob is moving closer to his goal price without making a huge jump. This shows willingness to compromise while still being firm.
* **Justified Offer:**  $8,750 is a halfway point between Alice's previous offer and Bob's previous counteroffer, making it seem reasonable. 
* **Maintaining a Positive Tone:**  The message remains friendly, showing that Bob is focused on finding a solution, not just getting the lowest price."
