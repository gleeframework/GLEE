"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is significantly lower than what I need to make this deal worthwhile.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $1,450,000.  Let's find a middle ground.",1450000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. How about we settle at $1,300,000? That's a fair offer.",1300000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $1,300,000 is still too far below my desired price. Let's meet in the middle again. I'm willing to lower my price to $1,400,000.  This is my final offer before I explore other options.",1400000.0,Alice,5,
