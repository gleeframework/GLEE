"Alice, your initial offer is a bit too steep for me. I'm interested in the product but my budget is closer to $800,000. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for it. Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While I understand your budget constraints, the product's true value is significantly higher than your initial offer. I'm willing to come down to $1,800,000. Let me know if this price point works for you.",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1,800,000 is still outside my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $1,400,000? This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'd be happy to proceed with the purchase.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
