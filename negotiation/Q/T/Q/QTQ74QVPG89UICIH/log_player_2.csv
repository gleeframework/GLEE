"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am delighted to present you with an exclusive opportunity to acquire our premium product. This item holds immense value to me, but considering its significance to you, I believe it could be a perfect match. I am offering you the chance to purchase this product at a special price of $950,000. This amount reflects the balance between its intrinsic worth and the potential benefits it could bring to you. I trust that you will find this proposal favorable and look forward to discussing further details with you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than buying from John:**  $950,000 is less than $1,200,000.
* **You still save money:** Even though Alice is selling the product for more than its value to her, you are still getting it for a lower price than what John is offering."
