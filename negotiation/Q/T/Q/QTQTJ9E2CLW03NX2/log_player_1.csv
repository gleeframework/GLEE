Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a great product for you that I think you'll love. I'm offering it for $150. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting at $150, which is higher than my minimum acceptable price of $120. This gives me room to negotiate down if needed.
* **Friendly approach:** I'm using a friendly tone to build rapport and make Bob feel comfortable.
* **Open to negotiation:** I'm asking for Bob's opinion to show that I'm open to discussion. 

I'm keeping in mind that I can always walk away and sell to John for $120 if the negotiation doesn't go in my favor."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $60. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $60 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $120. While I'm willing to negotiate, this offer is too far off.  I'm choosing to reject his offer and counter with a more reasonable price in the next round. I'm hoping to find a compromise that benefits both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $60 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $100.  This still leaves some room for both of us to be happy with the deal.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a compromise:**  I'm offering $100, which is a significant decrease from my initial offer but still above my minimum acceptable price. This shows I'm willing to negotiate. 
* **Maintain a friendly tone:** I'm keeping the message positive and friendly to keep the negotiation going smoothly.
* **Explain the rationale:**  I'm explaining my reasoning behind the counteroffer to show that it's based on fair considerations.
* **Open for further discussion:** I'm asking for Bob's thoughts to signal that I'm open to further negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $100 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $70 for the product. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $70 is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $120. While I'm willing to negotiate, I've already moved down from my initial offer of $150 to $100.  At this point, it seems Bob and I are too far apart on price.  Rather than risk further rounds of negotiation that might not lead to a satisfactory outcome, I'm going to sell the product to John for $120. This guarantees me a reasonable profit and avoids the risk of ending up with a much lower sale price."
