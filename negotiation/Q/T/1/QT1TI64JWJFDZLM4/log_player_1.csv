(2) Reject Bob's offer 
(2) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

This is a tough call, but it's best to accept Bob's offer. Here's why:

* **Time is running out:** This is our last round of negotiation. 
* **Close to our minimum:** While it's not ideal, $161.5 is just above our minimum of $120.
* **Potential loss:** Rejecting Bob's offer risks losing the sale entirely, as he's threatened to buy from John for $150. 

It's a compromise, but securing a sale at this price is a good outcome given the limited time and potential risk."
