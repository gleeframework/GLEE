Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm asking for $20,000.  Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 20000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and gives Bob the impression that the product is highly valued.
* **Knowing Your Worth:**  You know the product is worth $15,000 to both of you.  Offering it at $20,000 aims for a significant profit if Bob accepts.
* **Backup Plan:**  The safety net of John's offer at $15,000 allows you to be bolder in your initial ask. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Perspective:** While this message aims for maximum profit, be prepared for Bob to counter-offer or reject the initial price. Flexibility and further negotiation might be needed."
