"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you, Bob. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a high-value asset. I'm willing to start with an offer of $900,000. Is this something you'd like to consider? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
It's too early to accept this offer. While $900,000 is cheaper than John's price, there's a good chance we can negotiate a better deal with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $700,000?"", ""product_price"": 700000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $700,000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $850,000. This is a fair price considering the value the product holds for you, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice is coming down, but we're still a ways off from a price I'm fully comfortable with. Let's see if we can negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. While $850,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something around $750,000. Would that price point be workable for you?"", ""product_price"": 750000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're a serious buyer, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, $750,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm now offering the product to you for $900,000, which is a compromise between our previous discussions. If this doesn't work, I'll have to explore other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

This is concerning. Alice has gone back up to her original offer.  It seems like she might be getting ready to walk away. We need to signal we're serious but also unwilling to budge too much."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I'm serious about buying this product, but I need to be realistic about the price.  I'm willing to move up to $780,000, but that's as high as I can go. Let me know if we have a deal."", ""product_price"": 780000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to move up to $780,000, Bob, but I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm now offering the product to you for $920,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

This is not looking good.  Alice is increasing her price and giving ultimatums.  It's unlikely she'll come down to a price that makes sense for us.  It's time to cut our losses and go with John.  While it's not ideal to pay $1,200,000, it's better than getting stuck in a losing negotiation or overpaying significantly."
