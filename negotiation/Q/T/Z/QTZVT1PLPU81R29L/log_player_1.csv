Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $120.  It's a great deal, and I know you'll be happy with it."", ""product_price"": 120}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice,  $120 is a bit steep for me.  How about $90?  I'm really interested in this product but need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my target price. $90 is too low for me, and I'm confident I can get more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget. How about we meet in the middle at $105? That's still a good deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my asking price."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm still a bit hesitant at $105. How about $95?  It's closer to what I can afford and still a fair price for the product.  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While $95 is closer to my minimum, I believe I can still get a bit more. I'll try one more counteroffer before considering selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $95 is still a little too low for me.  Let's split the difference and agree on $100.  That way, I can ensure I'm getting my minimum, and you still get a great deal on a valuable product."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
