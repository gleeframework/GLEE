Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the effort, but I believe I can find the product elsewhere within my budget. Let me know if you're willing to lower the price to $1,200,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price.  $1,200,000 is still too low for me, and I believe I can get a better deal."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your response, Alice. While I understand your position, I am still looking to stay within my budget. Could we perhaps aim for $1,225,000? This would be a significant compromise for me, and I hope it might open up some room for us to reach an agreement.

While Bob is getting closer to my desired price, I don't think I can get any higher with him.  I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,500,000. It's not the absolute highest price, but it's a good deal for me and worth more than I'd make with Bob."
