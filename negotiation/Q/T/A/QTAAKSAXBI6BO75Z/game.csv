"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the effort, but I believe I can find the product elsewhere within my budget. Let me know if you're willing to lower the price to $1,200,000.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to negotiate, but $1,200,000 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,250,000? It's a fair price, and it would allow us both to walk away happy. Let me know what you think.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your response, Alice. While I understand your position, I am still looking to stay within my budget. Could we perhaps aim for $1,225,000? This would be a significant compromise for me, and I hope it might open up some room for us to reach an agreement.",1225000.0,Bob,4,
