"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $900,000 is a step in the right direction, but I'm still a bit away from where I need to be. How about we split the difference and go with $950,000?  This gives us both a fair deal and keeps the negotiation moving forward.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand where you're coming from, but $950,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $900,000 and $950,000. How about we try $925,000?",925000.0,Bob,4,
