"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a fantastic deal, considering its value to you. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

I'm starting high, aiming for a good chunk of the potential profit. I want to see if Bob is willing to meet me halfway.  This is a strong opening offer that leaves room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to make a compromise, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $900,000 is a good price, I want to see if I can push for more. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer in the next round. There's still room to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $900,000 is a step in the right direction, but I'm still a bit away from where I need to be. How about we split the difference and go with $950,000?  This gives us both a fair deal and keeps the negotiation moving forward."", ""product_price"": 950000} 
```

I'm offering $950,000, which is a compromise, but still closer to my desired price. This shows I'm willing to work with Bob while staying within the range of what's profitable for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand where you're coming from, but $950,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $900,000 and $950,000. How about we try $925,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd like to push for a higher price, we're getting close to the end of the negotiation. Accepting $925,000 ensures a good profit and avoids the risk of Bob walking away or having to sell to John at a lower price."
