"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this unique product. I believe it's a great fit for you and I'm willing to start with a price of $1000000. This is a competitive offer, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair price considering the product's value to you is $1200000.",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $800000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me is $1200000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think we can do better than $1000000.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're looking to meet in the middle, but I'm afraid I have to prioritize my minimum price. However, I'm willing to compromise and meet you halfway between $800000 and $1000000, which is $900000. This is my final offer for now, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price of $900000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $800000 and $1000000, which is $900000. However, I'm willing to go slightly lower and offer $850000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to me is $1200000.",850000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $900000. I'm willing to make one more compromise, so I'll meet you halfway between $900000 and $1000000, which is $950000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",950000.0,Alice,5,
