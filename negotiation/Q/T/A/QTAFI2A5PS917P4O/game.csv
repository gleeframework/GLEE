,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This still leaves some room for a profit for me and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. What do you say?",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $9,000, but I'm still a bit short on budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $8,200?",8200.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working with a tight budget, but $8,200 is still a little too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $8,500.  This is a final offer from me.  If it's not acceptable, I'll have to go with another buyer.  Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Alice,5,
