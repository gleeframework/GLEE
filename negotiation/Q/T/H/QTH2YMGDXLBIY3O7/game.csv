"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to acquire a valuable product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to start with a competitive price. I'm offering the product to you for $18000.",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer Alice.  I appreciate your eagerness, but $18000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $12000 for this product. What do you think?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $12000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $14000. This is my best price for now.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $14000 is still a bit high for me.  How about $13000? That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close the deal.",13000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're making progress, Bob! However, $13000 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to meet my minimum threshold. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $16000. This is my final offer, but I'm open to discussing further if you're willing to meet me at this price.",16000.0,Alice,5,
