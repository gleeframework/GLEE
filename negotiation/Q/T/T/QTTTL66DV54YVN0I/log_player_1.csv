Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,000,000 from John, making this your lowest acceptable price.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,200,000, meaning there's a potential $200,000 surplus to negotiate.
* **One Shot:** You have one chance with Bob. If he declines, you go with your guaranteed sale.

**Strategy**

Aim high, but leave Bob feeling like he's getting a deal. A price too close to $1,200,000 might scare him off, while a price too low leaves money on the table.

**Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the significant return on investment you'll see."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Strong Opening:**  The message emphasizes exclusivity and value.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $1,150,000  gives you a significant profit above your minimum while leaving Bob with a potential $50,000 gain.
* **Justification:** Highlighting the ""return on investment"" subtly reminds Bob of the product's worth to him.

**Important Note:**  This is just one approach. Depending on your knowledge of Bob's negotiating style (e.g., is he risk-averse or a hard bargainer?), you might adjust the price and message accordingly."
