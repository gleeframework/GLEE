Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you. I'm asking for $18,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 18000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since I know Bob values the product at $10,000, starting with a significantly higher price ($18,000) leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Potential for profit:**  There's a chance Bob might accept the offer outright, netting a great profit.
* **John as a safety net:** Even if Bob rejects, I can always fall back on selling to John for my minimum acceptable price. 

This strategy prioritizes maximizing potential profit while acknowledging the risk of losing Bob as a buyer."
