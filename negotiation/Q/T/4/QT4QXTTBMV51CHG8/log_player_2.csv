"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below your estimated value and above my minimum. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  He can get the product for a lower price.  While $12,000 is a good deal, it's still higher than Alice's minimum, meaning there's room for negotiation.  Bob should counteroffer and try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I appreciate you coming down from your initial price. However, I'm looking to get a better deal.  I'd be willing to pay $10,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $10,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need at least $11,000 to make this worthwhile. Let's find a middle ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  While he'd prefer a lower price, $11,000 is still a good deal for him, significantly below his maximum.  Continuing to negotiate might get the price down further, but the risk of Alice walking away or Bob needing to buy from John at a higher price is too high.  Accepting Alice's offer ensures Bob gets the product for a good price, and he can focus on other things."
