"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product.  Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,000,000. I'm open to discussing this further, so please let me know your thoughts.",1000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but  $1,000,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Given the value I place on this product, I'm willing to pay $850,000. This represents a fair price for both of us.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $850,000 is a respectable offer, the value of this product to me is significantly higher. I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the product's true worth.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $950,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $900,000. This is a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it represents a fair value for both of us. Let's finalize this deal.",900000.0,Bob,4,
