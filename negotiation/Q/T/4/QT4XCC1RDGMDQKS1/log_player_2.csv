"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product.  Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,000,000. I'm open to discussing this further, so please let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

``` 

It's not a good idea to accept Alice's initial offer. The product is worth $800,000 to you, and you can get it from John for that price. You need to negotiate with Alice to get the price down."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $850,000 is a respectable offer, the value of this product to me is significantly higher. I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the product's true worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000.

You're still better off trying to negotiate with Alice. While $950,000 is closer to your target, you can still likely get the price down further."
