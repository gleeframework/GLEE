"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to own this incredible product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,500,000. I'm confident this is a fair starting point for discussions."",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with a price higher than your desired outcome. This gives you room to negotiate down while still staying above your minimum.
* **Confident Tone:** Expressing confidence in the product's value helps influence Bob's perception of its worth.
* **Open to Discussion:**  Phrasing it as a ""starting point"" shows willingness to negotiate and find a mutually agreeable price.

By starting high, Alice leaves space to potentially meet Bob somewhere in the middle while still exceeding her minimum selling price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am looking to keep my investment within a certain budget. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,200,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer matches the minimum price Alice is willing to accept. While there might be a slight chance of negotiating a slightly higher price with Bob, it's a risky move.  

* **Guaranteed Sale:** John offers a guaranteed sale at Alice's desired price.
* **Time Savings:**  Negotiations can be unpredictable and time-consuming. Accepting John's offer provides immediate closure.
* **No Further Concessions:** Continuing with Bob might force Alice to make further concessions to close the deal, potentially jeopardizing her profit margin. 

It's in Alice's best interest to take the guaranteed sale at her desired price, even if it means potentially missing out on a slightly higher offer from Bob."
