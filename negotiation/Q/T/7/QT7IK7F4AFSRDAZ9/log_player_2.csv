Round 3
Alice's offer:

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $875,000 is a good compromise, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer: I'll sell the product to you for $925,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice has signaled this is her final offer. While we could try to negotiate further, the potential savings are getting smaller. Accepting at $925,000 secures a significant discount from both Alice's initial offer and John's price."
