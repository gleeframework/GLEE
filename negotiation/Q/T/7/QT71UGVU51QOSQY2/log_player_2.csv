"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,150,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as you know it's worth significantly more to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:** While it's below your maximum budget of $1,200,000, you can likely get a better deal by negotiating. 
* **Counteroffering is a good strategy:**  You have room to negotiate and can potentially secure a lower price by rejecting Alice's initial offer and making a counteroffer. 
* **John's offer is a fallback:**  If negotiations with Alice fail, you have a guaranteed backup option with John, but it's not your ideal scenario."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my asking price.  How about $1,100,000?  It's a fair compromise that would give us both a good deal.  Let me know your thoughts.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's counteroffer is closer, but still too high:** While $1,100,000 is a better price than her original offer, it's still above your preferred price point and leaves you with less profit.
* **Negotiation continues:** There's still room for further negotiation.  Rejecting Alice's offer allows you to continue the process and potentially secure a lower price.
* **John's offer is still a backup:**  You can always turn to John if you're unable to reach a deal with Alice, but you want to maximize your savings."
