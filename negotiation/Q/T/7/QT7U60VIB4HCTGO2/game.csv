"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,500. Would you be willing to consider this price?",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $8,500? I'm still confident you'll find this product valuable at that price.",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $8,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $8,000. Would you be willing to consider this price?",8000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $8,000 just doesn't quite work for me.  Let's try $8,250. It's a fair compromise and allows us both to reach a deal. What do you think?",8250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but $8,250 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $8,100, but no higher. Would you be willing to meet me at this price?",8100.0,Bob,6,
