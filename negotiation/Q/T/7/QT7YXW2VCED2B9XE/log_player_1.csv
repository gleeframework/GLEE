Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's still significantly less than Bob's perceived value, giving him room to negotiate.
* **Reasoning:**  I'm offering a price that's fair while still giving me a good profit.

Round 2

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I'm willing to negotiate, $1,000,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $1,100,000? I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-Offer:** I'm offering a counter-offer that's closer to my desired price but still shows flexibility.

This would still give you a good deal, and it's a fair price for the value of the product. "", ""product_price"": 1075000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Continuing to Negotiate:** I'm reiterating my willingness to compromise while still aiming for a higher price.
