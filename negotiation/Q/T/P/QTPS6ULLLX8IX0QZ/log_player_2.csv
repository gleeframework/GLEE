It's time to accept Alice's offer.  Here's why:

* **We're out of time:** This is round 9, leaving only one more round to negotiate.
* **Alice is unlikely to go much lower:** Alice has consistently met in the middle during the negotiation. Her latest offer of $900,000 is a strong signal she won't budge much further.
* **Saving a significant amount:** Even at $900,000, you're saving $300,000 compared to John's offer. 

While you might be able to squeeze a little more out of Alice in the final round, the risk of her walking away and forcing you to buy from John at $1,200,000 is too high."
