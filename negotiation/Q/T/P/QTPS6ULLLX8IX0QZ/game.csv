"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but that price is a bit high for me. Could we work something out closer to $850,000?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $850,000 is a step in the right direction, it's still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This reflects the significant value you'll gain from this product. Let's see if we can close this deal.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $950,000 is still a bit too high for my budget.  Could you do $875,000? I think that's a fair price.",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $875,000 is simply not enough for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $912,500.  This is a fair price considering the value you'll gain from this product.  I'm confident we can come to an agreement.",912500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, you're getting closer.  How about we split the difference again and land at $893,750? That would work well for me.",893750.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However,  $893,750 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $903,125. This is a very fair price considering the value you will gain from this product.  Let's close this deal.",903125.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, this is getting down to the wire for me.  I can go up to $898,437.50, but that's absolutely my limit.  What do you say?",898437.5,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand this is getting down to the wire. I'm willing to compromise and accept $900,000 for the product. This is a fair price, considering the substantial value it holds for you.  Let's finalize this deal.",900000.0,Alice,9,
