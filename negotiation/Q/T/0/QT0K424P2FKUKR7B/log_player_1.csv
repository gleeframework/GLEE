Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $175.  It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at a price higher than Bob's perceived value, hoping to secure a good deal.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While $175 is above Bob's value, it's still below my minimum threshold of $150, allowing for potential negotiation.
* **Positive Message:** I'm keeping the message upbeat and encouraging, aiming to maintain a positive relationship and increase the chances of a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice,  $175 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now.  I'd be interested in buying it for $100.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $100 is significantly below my minimum threshold of $150, and I'm not willing to accept such a low price.
* **Negotiation potential:**  While Bob's offer is unacceptable, it's still a starting point for further negotiation. I'm willing to explore counteroffers to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price. 
* **John as a safety net:** Knowing John is willing to buy for $150 gives me leverage during negotiations. I'm not desperate to sell to Bob, so I can afford to be firm in my counteroffers."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $100 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down a bit.  How about $125? It's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 125}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer:**  My counteroffer of $125 is a significant increase from Bob's offer but still below my minimum threshold. This shows I'm willing to compromise while maintaining a profitable price.
* **Positive Message:** The message remains positive and encouraging, keeping the conversation open for negotiation.
* **Balancing Profit and Negotiation:**  I'm aiming to find a middle ground that allows me to make a decent profit while still keeping Bob interested in continuing the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $125 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $110.  If that's not acceptable, I'll have to go with John's offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:**  While $110 is an improvement over his previous offers, it's still below my minimum threshold of $150 and wouldn't allow me to make a satisfactory profit. 
* **John's offer is secure:**  I know John is willing to pay $150, which is my minimum acceptable price. 
* **No further negotiation:**  I've already made two counteroffers, and Bob's response indicates he's not willing to budge significantly.  It's unlikely that further negotiation will result in a price I'm comfortable with.

Selling to John is the most sensible option, as it guarantees me a fair price without the risk of further negotiation with Bob."
