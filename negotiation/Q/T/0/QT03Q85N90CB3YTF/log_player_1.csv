Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's lower than your minimum, but still leaves room for negotiation.  I'm aiming to get as close to my $12,000 valuation as possible, but I'm also aware that Bob's value for the product is lower.  We'll see if he accepts or counteroffers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $9,500 is closer to my minimum, it's still far from the $12,000 I can get from John. I'm going to counteroffer and try to push Bob closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
``` 

I'm increasing the price slightly from my first offer, but still leaving room for negotiation. I believe $10,500 is a fair compromise, considering Bob's offer and my minimum. I'm hoping to reach an agreement without having to resort to selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, but it's still not worth risking further negotiation. At this point, I'm confident that John will buy the product for my desired price. Selling to John ensures I get the best possible outcome and avoids the risk of further haggling."
