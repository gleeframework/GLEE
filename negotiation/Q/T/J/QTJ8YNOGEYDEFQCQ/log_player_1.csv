"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe would be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $11,000.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price close to the middle of our perceived values to see if Bob is willing to negotiate from there. 
* **Leaving Room:**  This price leaves me room to negotiate down if needed while still ensuring a profit well above my minimum.
* **Building Rapport:** My message is friendly and focuses on the potential value of the product for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $11,000 is a bit higher than I'd like to spend right now. Would you be willing to come down to $9,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Potential for Better Deal:** While $9,500 is still above my minimum, Bob's willingness to negotiate shows he's interested.  I believe I can potentially get closer to my desired price. 
* **Maintaining Leverage:**  Rejecting his offer allows me to control the negotiation and make a counteroffer that might be more favorable.
* **Avoiding Premature Sale:** Selling to John now would lock me into a lower price than what I might be able to achieve with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer and see your enthusiasm for the product.  I'm willing to come down to $10,000.  This would still give me a fair profit and hopefully make this a deal we can both be happy with."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** My counteroffer is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway between our previous offers. This shows good faith and signals a desire to find common ground.
* **Maintaining Profit:** $10,000 is still a significant profit for me, and it keeps the negotiation moving forward.
* **Positive Framing:**  My message is positive and emphasizes the benefits for both of us, fostering a sense of collaboration."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm still a bit above my budget at $10,000. How about we split the difference and settle on $9,750?  This would be a fair price for both of us and allow us to reach a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Target:**  $9,750 is very close to my ideal profit margin, and further negotiation might risk losing the deal altogether. 
* **Time is a Factor:** We are already four rounds in, and I don't want to risk running out of time and having to sell to John for a lower price.
* **Fair Compromise:** Bob's offer is a fair compromise, and accepting it allows us to reach an agreement quickly."
