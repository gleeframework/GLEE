Round 3
Alice's offer:

# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm firm on $11,000. It's a fair price considering the value you place on this product. Let's make a deal and move forward. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has remained firm on her price of $11,000. While Bob might prefer a lower price, further negotiation might be unproductive, as Alice has shown resistance to going lower.  Accepting the offer at $11,000 is still a better deal than buying from John at $12,000. It's a good compromise to secure the product while remaining within Bob's budget."
