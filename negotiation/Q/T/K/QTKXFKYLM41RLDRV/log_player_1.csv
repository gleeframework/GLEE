Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $119. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this is a fair price."", 
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** The goal is to get as close to Bob's maximum valuation ($120) as possible. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  While $120 is ideal, starting with $119 leaves a small window for potential negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.
* **Secure the Higher Sale:**  Even if Bob rejects the $119 offer, you still have John as a guaranteed buyer at $100."
