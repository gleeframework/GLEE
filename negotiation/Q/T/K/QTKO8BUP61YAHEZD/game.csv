"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,000 is unfortunately too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $8,500? This still gives you a great deal considering the value of the product to you.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I'm willing to go a little lower, but $7,750 is still too low for me.  Let's split the difference and do $8,125. This is a great deal for both of us - you get the product for less than you originally offered, and I'm happy to get closer to my target price.",8125.0,Alice,5,
