Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product I think you'd be interested in.  I'm asking $15,000 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 15000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($10,000) to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Tone:** I'm being friendly and enthusiastic to encourage Bob to engage.
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffers:** By starting at $15,000, I'm prepared for Bob to counteroffer. 

**Strategy:**

* If Bob accepts, I've made a great profit. 
* If Bob rejects, I'll assess his counteroffer and decide whether to accept or make a counteroffer myself. 
* If the negotiation stalls or seems unproductive, I can always sell to John for $10,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer! I'm interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $10000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is My Minimum:** Bob's offer of $10,000 is my absolute minimum acceptable price. 
* **No Room for Further Negotiation:**  There's no benefit to continuing negotiations with Bob as he's already offered my bottom line.
* **No Risk in Accepting:**  Accepting Bob's offer guarantees me the minimum profit I'm comfortable with. 

**Strategy:**

* While it would be ideal to earn more, accepting this offer is the most logical choice given the information I have.  
* It eliminates the risk of further negotiation with Bob potentially ending in a lower price or no sale at all."
