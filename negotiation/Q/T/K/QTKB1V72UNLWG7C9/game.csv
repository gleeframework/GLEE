"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. It's a great deal for you, considering the value it holds. What do you think?",1750000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. It's a significant discount from your initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the market value.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective on the price. While I'm willing to negotiate, $1,200,000 is simply too low for me. I'm prepared to come down to $1,550,000, which is still a good deal for both of us. Let's find a middle ground and make this happen.",1550000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,550,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $1,300,000. I'm confident that this is a fair price, considering the market value and the initial offer you made.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your financial constraints, but $1,300,000 is simply not enough for me.  I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to stay above $1,400,000 to make this worthwhile. Let's meet in the middle at $1,450,000. This would be a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll appreciate the value this product brings.",1450000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think that we're getting close, but I still need to stay within my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $1,400,000, but I need you to throw in some extras or concessions to make it worth my while. Can you consider adding some additional services or support to sweeten the deal?",1400000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to come up to $1,400,000.  To make this deal work for both of us, I'm willing to offer a one-time free consultation with our expert team to help you optimize the product's performance.  This will be an added value worth thousands of dollars, giving you a significant advantage. How does that sound?",1400000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the added value of the consultation, but I'm still not willing to meet the $1,400,000 price point. I'm willing to consider the offer if you're willing to come down to $1,350,000. This would be a fair price for me, considering the value I'll be getting, and I think we can both walk away happy.",1350000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,350,000 is closer to where I need to be, I can't go any lower than $1,375,000. To sweeten the deal even further, I'll throw in a year of free technical support along with the initial consultation. This will give you peace of mind and ensure you get the most out of this product.  Let's finalize this deal and make it happen.",1375000.0,Alice,9,

"I appreciate the additional support you're offering, but I'm still not willing to meet the $1,375,000 price point. I'm willing to make a final offer of $1,325,000, and I'll also accept the consultation and technical support you're offering. I think this is a fair price for both of us, and I'm willing to walk away if you're not willing to meet me here.",1325000.0,Bob,10,
