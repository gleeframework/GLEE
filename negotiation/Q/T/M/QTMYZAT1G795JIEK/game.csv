"Hello Bob, I'm excited to show you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $10000. Is this something you'd like to consider?",10000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I'm interested in the product, $10000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $7500 for it. What do you think?",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $7500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer it to you for $9000. Is that something you'd consider?",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $9000 is still a bit high for my budget.  How about we split the difference and settle on $8250?  I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us.",8250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $8250. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I get a fair price for the product. I'll offer it to you for $9500. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's still a great deal for you.",9500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need a fair price, and I'm trying to be fair as well.  Let's meet in the middle again. I'll offer $8750. This is my final offer, and if it's not acceptable, I'll have to consider other options.",8750.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to be fair, Bob, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for less than $8000. I'm willing to meet you at $8500, but that's as low as I can go. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",8500.0,Alice,7,
