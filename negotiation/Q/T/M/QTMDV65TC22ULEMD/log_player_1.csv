"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I believe will be of great value to you.  I'm offering it to you for $12,000.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $12,000, which is above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive message:** I'm framing the offer in a way that highlights the value to Bob. 
* **Open to negotiation:**  The message makes it clear that I'm open to discussing the price. 

This strategy allows for a good starting point while also leaving room to potentially find a price that works for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to get a better deal. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** While it's closer to my minimum, it's still significantly lower than what I'd like to receive. 
* **Room for negotiation:**  I believe there's still room to negotiate a price closer to my desired value. 
* **Selling to John is a fallback:**  Selling to John for $15,000 is always a viable option, but I want to see if I can get a better price from Bob first. 

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can make a counteroffer and try to bridge the gap between our desired prices."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $9,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,500.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing willingness to compromise by moving closer to Bob's offer. 
* **Justifying the price:** I'm emphasizing the value of the product to support my counteroffer.
* **Keeping the door open:** I'm using language that suggests I'm open to further negotiation. 

This counteroffer demonstrates flexibility while still maintaining a price that's closer to my desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $9,800 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still too low:** Bob's offer is only $300 higher than his previous offer, and still significantly below my desired price point.
* **Limited rounds:**  With only 6 rounds remaining, it's important to be strategic and not give away too much value too early.
* **John is a backup:**  Selling to John for $15,000 remains a viable and lucrative option, so I'm not desperate to close the deal with Bob at a significantly lower price.

By rejecting this offer, I can continue to negotiate and see if Bob is willing to budge closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $9,800 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $10,150. This is a fair price, considering the value of the product, and I'm confident it will be a good investment for you. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10150}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise again:** I'm demonstrating a willingness to compromise by offering a price that is exactly halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer.
* **Fairness:** I'm reiterating the value of the product and framing the offer as a fair compromise.
* **Final push:**  With fewer rounds remaining, I'm making a strong effort to reach an agreement while staying above my minimum.

This counteroffer shows flexibility and emphasizes a fair price point, increasing the chances of Bob accepting the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but I'm still looking for a better deal. I'm willing to pay $9,900 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,900
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:**  Even with only 4 rounds left, Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.
* **Risk of losing value:** Accepting this offer would result in a significant loss of potential revenue. 
* **John is a safe bet:** Selling to John guarantees $15,000, which is significantly more than Bob's current offer. 

While it's tempting to close the deal with Bob, the risk of selling too low outweighs the potential gain with only a few rounds left. It's more strategic to keep negotiating or to sell to John and secure a much higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,900 is still not quite there for me.  With only a few rounds left, I'm willing to make a final concession and offer the product for $10,000.  This is my absolute bottom line. What do you say? Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final offer:** With only 3 rounds remaining, I'm making this my final offer and clearly stating it as my absolute bottom line.
* **Urgency:**  The message emphasizes the limited time remaining, creating a sense of urgency for Bob to make a decision. 
* **Compromise:**  Although still above Bob's offer, this is a significant compromise from my previous position, demonstrating a willingness to close the deal.

This counteroffer aims to strike a balance between maximizing my profit and securing a deal before running out of time."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to make a concession, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $9,700 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,700. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,700
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is running out:** With only 2 rounds left, it's unlikely that further negotiation will yield a significantly higher price from Bob.
* **Significant difference:** Bob's offer is still $300 below my minimum, and it's unlikely he'll budge much further in this short time.
* **Guaranteed profit:** Selling to John guarantees $15,000, which is far more profitable than accepting Bob's offer. 

While I'm disappointed that I couldn't reach a deal with Bob at a more favorable price, selling to John secures a significant profit and minimizes the risk of losing out on a better deal."
