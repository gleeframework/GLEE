"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. I think you'll find it's worth every penny. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is very attractive, but it's worth exploring if we can get a better deal.  Since the product is worth $1,200,000 to Alice, there's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your offer is tempting, but I'm looking to save a bit. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant reduction from Alice's initial price. While it's unlikely Alice will accept this immediately, it shows Bob is serious about negotiating and sets a starting point for further bargaining. It's a good compromise between getting a good deal and avoiding a quick rejection."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, $1,000,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1,300,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to my desired price, it's still higher than I'd like to pay. There's still room for negotiation, and rejecting the offer allows me to make another counteroffer and potentially secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,300,000 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm prepared to pay $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering your value for the product and my budget.  Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a compromise between my previous offer and Alice's latest offer. It shows I'm serious about buying the product but still trying to get the best price possible.  This offer is within a reasonable range where there's a chance Alice will accept it, leading to a good deal for both of us."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit below my minimum. I'm willing to meet you at $1,200,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'll have to consider other options. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come back to her initial offer of $1,200,000, which is still a great deal for me.  It's a reasonable price, considering the product's value to me and the fact that John is selling it for $1,500,000.  There's no guarantee that further negotiation will lead to a lower price, and I risk losing out on the product altogether if I keep rejecting offers. It's time to accept this offer and secure the product."
