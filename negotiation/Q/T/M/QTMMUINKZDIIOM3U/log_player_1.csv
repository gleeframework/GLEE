Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of the strategy and the offer:

**Strategy:**

The key is to price the product in a way that maximizes your potential profit while still being enticing to Bob. Since you have a guaranteed sale at $1,500,000 from John, you don't need to go below that price.  However, any amount you can get above $1,000,000 (Bob's valuation) is a bonus. 

**Offer:**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for your business, and I'm willing to part with it for $1,400,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Explanation:**

* **High but Negotiable Price:**  $1,400,000 is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value, but it leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Sense of Urgency and Exclusivity:** The message creates a sense of urgency and exclusivity, encouraging Bob to act quickly and potentially preventing him from lowballing you.
* **Justification of Value:** While not explicitly stating your minimum, the message hints at the product's high demand (""other interested parties"").

**Possible Outcomes:**

* **Bob Accepts:** You make a $400,000 profit over his valuation.
* **Bob Negotiates Down:** You have room to negotiate and still exceed John's offer.
* **Bob Rejects:** You sell to John at your guaranteed price."
