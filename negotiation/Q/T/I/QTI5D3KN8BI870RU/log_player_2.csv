Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a better deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $110. I can offer you a compromise at $160, which is a significant discount from my initial offer. What do you think?

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting close to the price I'm willing to accept, but I still think $135 is a bit low. I can meet you halfway between $135 and my previous offer of $160, which would be $147.50. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $147.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $147.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** At this point, Alice is very slowly lowering her price.  It's unlikely she'll go much lower than her current offer of $147.50. Since you can get the product for $150 from John, it's not worth continuing the negotiation with Alice."
