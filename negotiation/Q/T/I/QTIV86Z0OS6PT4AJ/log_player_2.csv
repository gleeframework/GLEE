{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the opportunity to acquire this unique product,  $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $900,000.  This reflects the value I see in the product and allows for some room for both of us to benefit from this deal."", ""product_price"": 900000}

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $900000 is a significant discount, but I'm still looking to get a better price for this unique product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1100000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I believe it's a good compromise.

While Alice's offer is a step closer to my target price, it's still higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to keep negotiating to see if we can get closer to my ideal price. There are still several rounds left, and I can always buy from John as a last resort."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000, which is a fair price considering the value of the product and my financial constraints. I believe this is a reasonable compromise that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Increase:** This counteroffer demonstrates a willingness to negotiate by offering a modest increase from my previous offer.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $1000000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $1050000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down significantly from her initial offer. At this point, it's getting close to my target price, and I'm starting to run out of rounds. While I would prefer to get it even lower,  accepting the offer ensures I get the product at a good price without risking losing it to John or running out of negotiation rounds."
