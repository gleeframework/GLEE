"Hi Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for a special price. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $120. It's a steal at this price, if I do say so myself!",120.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice! While I am interested in the product, $120 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps closer to $80?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand where you're coming from, but I'm not willing to go as low as $80. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can do $95, and that's as low as I'm willing to go. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. What do you think?",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  How about we settle at $87? That's a fair compromise in my mind.",87.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $87 is a good compromise, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable going that low. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can do $92, and that's as low as I'm willing to go. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. What do you think?",92.0,Alice,5,
