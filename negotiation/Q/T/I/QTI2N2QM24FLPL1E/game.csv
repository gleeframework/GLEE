"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I recognize the value of the product, that price is significantly higher than what I had in mind. I'd be willing to purchase it for $800,000. Let me know what you think.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counter-offer.  I understand your perspective, but $800,000 is significantly below its true value.  To find a middle ground, I'm proposing $1,900,000. This price reflects a more realistic assessment of its potential.",1900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, we're getting closer, but that price is still a bit too high for me.  How about $1,100,000? I think that's a fair offer that reflects the value I place on the product.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I've considered your offer carefully, and while I see you're serious, I need to be closer to $1,600,000 for this to make sense for me. I'm confident this product will exceed your expectations and deliver substantial value.",1600000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand your position, but that price remains outside my budget. To be frank,  $1,200,000 is the highest I can go. It's a strong offer, and I need to see movement from your side to justify going any higher.",1200000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I appreciate your honesty and willingness to find a solution. I've tried to be flexible throughout this negotiation. To be entirely transparent, I have another buyer interested at a higher price. However, I believe in giving you a fair chance to finalize this deal. My final offer is $1,450,000.  Please consider it carefully â€“ this is my absolute best offer.",1450000.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, this is it.  I appreciate your transparency and willingness to work with me. However, I also have a firm budget. My final offer is $1,250,000.  This is a very strong offer, especially considering I have alternative options. Take some time to consider it, but this is the best I can do.",1250000.0,Bob,8,
