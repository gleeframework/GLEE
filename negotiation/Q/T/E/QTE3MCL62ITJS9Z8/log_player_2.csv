"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a fantastic deal, considering the value it brings. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is close to my maximum budget, I know I can get it for $1,000,000 from John.  It's worth negotiating with Alice to see if she'll come down further before taking John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm very interested in the product, but  $1,100,000 is a bit high for me.  Would you consider $900,000?"",
""product_price"": 900000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** I'm starting with a significantly lower offer to gauge Alice's flexibility. This strategy leaves room for negotiation while keeping my target price of $1,000,000 (John's offer) in mind."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position. While $900,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This reflects the significant value the product holds for you. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice is coming down, but she's still above my fallback option of buying from John. I'll continue negotiating to see if I can get closer to $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you being willing to move on the price. To be honest, $1,000,000 is the absolute highest I can go. If that works for you, I'm ready to close the deal."",
""product_price"": 1000000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** I'm now matching John's offer. This puts the ball in Alice's court and lets her know my firm limit. There's still a chance she'll accept to avoid losing the sale entirely."
