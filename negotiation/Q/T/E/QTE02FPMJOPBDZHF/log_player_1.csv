Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you might be interested in. It's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to sell it for $100.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 
 
This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're asking for more than your minimum of $80, which means you'll make a profit.
* **It's below Bob's perceived value:** Bob values the product at $120, so he has room to negotiate and still feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **It leaves room for counteroffers:**  By offering $100, you allow for some back-and-forth without immediately hitting a dead end. 
 
Keep in mind, this is just the first offer. You'll need to adjust your strategy based on Bob's response and your willingness to negotiate with him or move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is close to your minimum price, and you've already established a strong negotiating position by getting him to come down from his initial perceived value. Accepting his offer ensures a quick sale and a decent profit, and it's unlikely that further negotiation will yield a significantly better result."
