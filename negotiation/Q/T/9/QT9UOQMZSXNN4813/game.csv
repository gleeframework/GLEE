"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer!  $120 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  How about $90?  I'm really interested in this product.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer

"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $105 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's meet in the middle at $100.  That way we both get a good deal.",100.0,Bob,4,
