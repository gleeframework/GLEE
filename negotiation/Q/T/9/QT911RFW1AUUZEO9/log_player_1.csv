Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it's worth a great deal and would be happy to sell it for $10,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a price closer to Bob's perceived value.
* **Justification:** While not overly detailed, phrasing the offer with ""I believe it's worth a great deal"" subtly implies the product's value to you, justifying the higher asking price. 
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The tone remains friendly and ends with an open question, inviting Bob to engage in the negotiation process. 

While there's a chance Bob might reject this initial offer, it's a calculated risk. You can always negotiate down, especially knowing you have a guaranteed sale at $8,000 with John."
