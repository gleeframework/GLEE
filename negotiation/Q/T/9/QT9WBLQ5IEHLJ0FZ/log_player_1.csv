Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it would be highly valuable to you, and I'm willing to part with it for $14,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close as possible to Bob's maximum perceived value ($15,000) without scaring him off.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high allows for potential negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer. 
* **Above Reserve Price:** $14,000 is significantly above your minimum acceptable price ($12,000), ensuring a good profit margin. 

This strategy aims to balance ambition with the risk of losing the sale to Bob."
