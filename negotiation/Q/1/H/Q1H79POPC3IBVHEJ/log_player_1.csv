Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really love it! I'm offering it to you for $135. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 135}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above your minimum:**  $135 is more than your minimum price of $150, so you're still making a profit.
* **It's within Bob's range:** Bob values the product at $120, so $135 is within a range he might consider.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** This price allows for some wiggle room to negotiate if Bob counteroffers. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the product, but I'm looking to stay within my budget of $120. Would you be able to accommodate that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $120 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  I'll counteroffer Bob to try and get closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your interest. However, $120 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $130? This way we can both be happy with the deal."", ""product_price"": 130}
```

This counteroffer aims to find a middle ground:

* **Slightly lower than the initial offer:** It shows a willingness to negotiate and meet Bob halfway.
* **Still above my minimum:** $130 is still above my minimum price of $150. 
* **Provides justification:**  It uses a logical argument of splitting the difference to make it more persuasive."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your response, Alice. I understand your position and appreciate your flexibility. However, I'm still looking to keep the cost at or below $120. Would it be possible to negotiate down to $120? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob is insistent on $120, which is below my minimum. While I'm open to negotiation, I've already made concessions.  To avoid further haggling and ensure I get a price I'm comfortable with, I'll sell the product to John for $150."
