"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate your willingness to sell the product. However, given my budget constraints, I am only able to offer $800,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your constraints. While I'm willing to negotiate, $800,000 is simply too low for me. I'm prepared to offer a slight discount, but I need to be compensated fairly for the product's value. How about $825,000? It's a fair price that reflects the product's worth, and it's still within a reasonable range for you.",825000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thank you for your offer. I've considered your proposal carefully, and while I appreciate the slight discount, I'm still unable to meet the price of $825,000. My maximum budget remains at $800,000. I believe we might be able to reach an agreement closer to this amount. Would it be possible for you to consider $810,000?",810000.0,Bob,4,
