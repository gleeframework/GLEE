Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its immense value, I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering its worth to both of us."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,500,000, meaning he'd be willing to pay up to that amount.
* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,000,000 from John, so any offer below that is pointless.
* **Maximizing Profit:** Aiming for a price close to Bob's valuation while staying above your minimum maximizes your potential profit.
* **Chosen Price:** $1,350,000 leaves a significant profit margin for you ($350,000) while still offering Bob a good deal compared to his own valuation. 

This strategy attempts to secure the highest possible price from Bob before resorting to the guaranteed sale with John."
