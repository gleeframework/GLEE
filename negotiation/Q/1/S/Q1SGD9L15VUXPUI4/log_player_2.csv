"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on this fantastic product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $90. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's.**  While $90 is more than the product is worth to Alice, it's still less than the $100 you'd pay John. 
* **Your goal is to save money.** Accepting Alice's offer means you get the product for a lower price."
