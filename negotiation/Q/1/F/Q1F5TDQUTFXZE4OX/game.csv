"Bob, I appreciate your interest and I understand that $8000 is a lower price point.  However, I'm still quite a bit away from where I need to be on this.  I'm willing to come down to $16000.  Would you be willing to consider this? ",16000.0,Alice,3,

I'm still a bit far from the $16000 price point. I was thinking more along the lines of $10000. Can you meet me in the middle?,10000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $10000 is a bit lower than what I'm aiming for, I'm willing to meet you halfway at $13000.  This is a fair price that's closer to your budget while still allowing me to cover my costs.  What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,5,
