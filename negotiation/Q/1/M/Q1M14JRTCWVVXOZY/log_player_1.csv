Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $100. This price is higher than Bob's perceived value of $80, but lower than my minimum acceptable value of $120. This allows for some potential profit while also increasing the likelihood of Bob accepting the offer. If he rejects it, I can still sell to John for my minimum price."
