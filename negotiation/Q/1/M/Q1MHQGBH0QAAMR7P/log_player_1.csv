Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you first at a special price of $100. I think it's a great deal for something you'll find valuable. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 100
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While the product's worth to you is $80, you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at that price. Therefore, your goal is to see if Bob will pay more.
* **Reasonable Markup:** Starting with a $100 offer (a $20 markup) seems reasonable. It's not excessively high, so it might be enticing to Bob while still securing a potential profit for you. 
* **First Refusal Tactic:**  By mentioning it's a ""special price"" offered to him ""first,"" you subtly create a sense of scarcity and opportunity. 

**Important Note:** This is just one possible strategy. There's no guarantee Bob will accept this offer. You could experiment with different price points and messages to see what works best."
