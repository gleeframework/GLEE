Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm willing to let it go for $20,000. This is a limited-time offer, so I encourage you to act quickly."",
""product_price"": 20000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  While Bob values the product at $8,000, Alice knows it's worth $15,000 to her worst-case scenario (selling to John). Starting with a high offer of $20,000 leaves room for negotiation.
* **Creating Urgency:** By stating it's a ""limited-time offer,"" Alice encourages Bob to make a decision sooner rather than later, potentially leading him to accept a price he might otherwise decline.
* **Justification:**  The message vaguely mentions ""value and potential,"" subtly implying reasons for the high price without revealing Alice's bottom line.

**Important Notes:**

* This is just one possible strategy. Depending on Bob's personality and negotiating style, different approaches might be more effective.
* Alice needs to be prepared to negotiate. If Bob rejects the initial offer, she can gradually lower the price, but never below $15,000."
