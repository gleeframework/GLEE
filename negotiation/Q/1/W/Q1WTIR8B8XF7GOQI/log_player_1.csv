Round 2
Bob's offer:

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is slowly increasing his offer, it's clear he's unlikely to reach a price that's significantly better than what John is offering. Accepting Bob's offer at $1,400,000 means a loss of $100,000 compared to John's guaranteed $1,500,000. It's not worth the risk of continuing the negotiation with Bob."
