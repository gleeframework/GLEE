I'm starting with a high offer, aiming for the best possible deal. I'm confident the product is worth at least this much to me, and I'm hoping Bob might be willing to pay a premium. If he rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, but I believe I can still get a better deal. I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}

I'm raising the price slightly from Bob's offer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but still value the product highly. I'm hoping to find a middle ground that works for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's latest offer is close to my minimum and a significant improvement from his previous offer.  Since I'm comfortable with this price and it's higher than what John is offering, it makes sense to accept and close the deal."
