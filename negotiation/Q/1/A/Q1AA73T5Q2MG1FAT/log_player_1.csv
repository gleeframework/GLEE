Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm willing to offer it to you for $95. I think it's a fair price considering its worth."", ""product_price"": 95}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** I want to get as close to $100 as possible, but I also want to make sure Bob accepts the offer.
* **Bob's Valuation:** I know Bob values the product at $80, so I need to offer a price that's appealing but still profitable for me.
* **Alternative Buyer:**  I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $100, so there's no pressure to go below that.

Offering the product at $95 gives Bob a chance to gain some value ($15 profit for him) while still giving me a significant profit."
