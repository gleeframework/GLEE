"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, and I believe it has the potential to be incredibly valuable for you. I'm asking $1,100,000 for it. Let me know what you think.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, while I appreciate the offer, $1,100,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $900,000 for this product.  I believe this is a fair price considering its potential value.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, but $900,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the potential it holds for you. I'm confident this is a deal we can both be happy with.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,050,000 is closer, I'm still not quite there. How about $950,000? I believe this is a fair compromise, and we can both walk away happy with the deal.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $950,000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $1,000,000. This is a fair price, considering the product's value and potential for your business. It's a win-win for both of us. Let's close this deal.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
