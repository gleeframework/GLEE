Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really love. I'm asking for $90 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 90} 
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price of $90. This gives me a good margin and leaves room for negotiation. If Bob rejects, I can lower the price a bit, but I won't go below $80 as that's my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for offering me the product. I believe I can offer you $85 for it. Looking forward to your response. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer of $85 is a good deal for me. It's above my minimum of $80, and it's likely that if I reject his offer, he may not come back with a higher counteroffer. I don't want to risk losing the sale to John, so I'll accept Bob's offer."
