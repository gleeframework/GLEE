Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a great deal for a product worth significantly more. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's valuation:** This gives Bob an incentive to negotiate.
* **It's below your minimum:** You're still making a profit.
* **It's not too far off from John's offer:**  You still have a good backup option if Bob rejects."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $11500 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay at this time.  I'd be happy to buy it from you for $10500. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still significantly lower than your minimum valuation of $12,000. You have a better chance of getting closer to your desired price by continuing the negotiation.  Selling to John is always an option, but it's not the best choice at this point, as you're likely to get a higher price by continuing with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget.  I'm willing to come down a bit more to $11,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
