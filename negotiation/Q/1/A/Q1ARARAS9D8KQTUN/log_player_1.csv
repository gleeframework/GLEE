Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. It's a unique opportunity, and I believe the value you'll gain from it justifies the price. Let's discuss!"", ""product_price"": 1750000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your confidence in the product's value, Alice. However, I'm a bit hesitant to pay $1,750,000. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,400,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the market value of similar products. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
While Bob's offer is tempting,  it's below my minimum value. I'll try to counter and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,400,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to stay above my minimum. I'm offering $1,600,000. This reflects the unique value of the product and still provides you with a good deal.  Let's find a compromise that benefits us both."", ""product_price"": 1600000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,500,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the market conditions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

Bob's offer is now at my minimum acceptable price. It's a good deal, and I don't want to risk losing this opportunity by continuing to negotiate."
