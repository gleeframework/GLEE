Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $9,750 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,250. This is a fair price, and it's getting closer to what I need. Let's see if we can finalize this deal.

We're getting close, but there's still room for negotiation. Alice is coming down in smaller increments, which suggests we're approaching her lower limit. Let's see if we can push a little further."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, you're right, we're getting close. How about $10,000 even? That's my final offer."",

}
```

We're now at our walk-away point. This offer is firm but fair, and it gives Alice a chance to make a small profit.  If she rejects this, we'll take John's offer."
