"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $14,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $12,500 for the product.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",12500.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $12,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $13,500. This is still a great deal, and I'm confident you'll love the product.",13500.0,Alice,3,
