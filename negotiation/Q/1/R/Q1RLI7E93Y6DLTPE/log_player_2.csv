"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $14,000. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better offer anywhere else. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  He can likely get a better deal by making a counteroffer.  $14,000 is still too high for Bob, and he knows he can get the product for $15,000 from John if necessary.  It makes sense to try and negotiate a lower price with Alice first."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $12,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $13,500. This is still a great deal, and I'm confident you'll love the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  $13,500 is a good price for him, as it's within his budget and lower than what John is selling it for.  While he could try to negotiate further, the risk of Alice rejecting his counteroffer and then him having to buy from John for a higher price isn't worth it.  This is a good compromise and a solid deal for Bob."
