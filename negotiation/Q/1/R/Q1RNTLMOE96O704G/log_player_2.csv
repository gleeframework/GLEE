"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. I think this is a great price considering the value it brings to your business. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob can potentially get a better deal than $900,000.  He knows the product is worth $800,000 to Alice, so there's room to negotiate.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and try to secure a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $925,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $925,000 is better than the initial $900,000, Bob can still potentially do better. He knows Alice is willing to go down to at least $850,000, so there's still room for negotiation.  By rejecting the offer, Bob can make another counteroffer and try to get closer to his desired price."

{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $925,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go to $875,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close the deal at this point."", ""product_price"": 875000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $875,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer the product to you for $900,000. This is the best price I can offer, and I'm confident it's still a fair deal for both of us.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $900,000 is the same as her original offer. While Bob could continue negotiating, it's becoming clear that Alice is firm on this price.  It's likely that further negotiations will be time-consuming and may not result in a significantly lower price.  At $900,000, Bob is still getting a good deal compared to John's price of $1,200,000.  Accepting the offer saves time and ensures a purchase at a price that's significantly lower than the alternative."
