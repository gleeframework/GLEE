"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000.  It's a significant investment, but I believe the value it offers will be worth it for you.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum value, hoping to maximize my profit.
* **Justifying the Price:** I'm giving Bob a reason to consider the offer beyond just the price, highlighting the potential value the product provides.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  This price leaves room for negotiation if Bob counteroffers, without immediately jeopardizing my minimum acceptable value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the $1,200,000 price point. I am willing to pay up to $900,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Below Minimum:**  While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum value, it still falls short of the $1,000,000 I'm hoping to achieve. 
* **Opportunity for a Counteroffer:** I still have 9 rounds left and want to see if I can push for a better price. I'm confident I can get closer to my desired value with a counteroffer.
* **Selling to John is a Safety Net:**  While I'd prefer a higher price, selling to John for $1,000,000 remains a viable option if negotiations with Bob fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $900,000 is closer to my desired price, I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This reflects the significant value the product offers, and I believe it's a fair price that we can both be happy with. Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bridging the Gap:** I'm moving closer to Bob's offer while still staying above my minimum desired price. This shows I'm serious about negotiating and willing to compromise.
* **Highlighting Value:**  I'm emphasizing the value the product provides to remind Bob of the potential return on his investment.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a positive tone to encourage Bob to accept this offer and conclude the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I understand the value of your product, but I need to stick to my budget. I am now willing to consider $1,050,000 as a potential price for the product. I hope this is within your range. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Goal:** Bob's offer of $1,050,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable value of $1,000,000. 
* **Limited Rounds:** We are only in Round 4, and I have 6 rounds left.  There's a good chance I can push for a slightly higher price, but the risk of losing the deal to Bob entirely is significant. 
* **Potential for Future Deals:** While I want to maximize my profit, securing this deal with Bob could open up opportunities for future business with him, potentially leading to even more lucrative transactions. 

Accepting this offer ensures a good profit and keeps the door open for future collaboration."
