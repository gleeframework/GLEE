Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value and the interest I've had, I'm initially proposing a price of $14,000.  I'm open to hearing your thoughts on this."",
""product_price"": 14000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Setting the bar high:**  Alice knows her product's worth and has a guaranteed buyer at $12,000. Starting with a higher offer ($14,000) leaves room for negotiation and potentially a higher profit margin.
* **Gauge Bob's interest:** The message is framed to understand how interested Bob truly is. If he's completely turned off by the price, Alice hasn't lost anything.
* **Justification:** By mentioning other interest, Alice creates a sense of value and demand, subtly encouraging Bob to consider the offer seriously.
* **Open to negotiation:**  The phrase ""I'm open to hearing your thoughts on this"" signals to Bob that Alice is willing to negotiate, increasing the likelihood of a deal. 

**Important Note:** While Alice has a fallback option (John), pushing Bob too hard with an unreasonable price might make him walk away without even counter-offering. This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing profit and securing a deal."
