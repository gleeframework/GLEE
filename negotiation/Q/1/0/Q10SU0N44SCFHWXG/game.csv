"Alice, thank you for the offer, but $18000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $12000, which is my maximum budget. Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my original offer. How about $15000?  It's still a good price for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. Let's make this deal!",15000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $15000 is still a bit high for me.  I understand you need to make a profit, but I'm really only comfortable going up to $13000.  This would be a fair price for both of us, and we could get this deal done.",13000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $13000 just doesn't work for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $14000.  This price reflects the value of the product and gives you a good deal. Let's close this now.",14000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, $14000 is still above my budget. I'm really pushing the limits here, but I'm willing to go to $13500. This is my final offer.  If you're not willing to accept it, I'll have to go with John's offer.",13500.0,Bob,6,
