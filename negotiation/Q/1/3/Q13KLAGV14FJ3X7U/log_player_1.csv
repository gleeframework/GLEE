Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. I think it would be incredibly valuable to you.  Given its potential, I'm offering it at $1,300,000."", ""product_price"": 1300000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price closer to Bob's perceived value ($1,500,000) than my minimum ($1,000,000). This leaves room for negotiation but keeps the potential profit high. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The offer  gives Bob the opportunity to negotiate down while still allowing me to make a significant profit.
* **Alternative Option:** Having John as a backup buyer ensures I won't be pressured into accepting a deal below my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. It's a good starting point, but I'm looking to spend a bit less. How about $1,100,000? I believe this is still a fair price given the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is above my minimum, it's a significant drop from my initial asking price.  I believe there's room for negotiation. Rejecting this offer signals that I'm looking for a better deal. I'm willing to risk continuing the negotiation because I have John as a reliable backup."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you countering.  That said, $1,100,000 is a significant step down from my initial offer. This product offers tremendous value, and I need to see a price that reflects that. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $1,200,000?"",
""product_price"": 1200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** By suggesting a price halfway between our previous offers, I'm demonstrating a willingness to compromise while still aiming for a higher price point. 
* **Justification:** I'm reiterating the product's value to justify the higher price and avoid appearing overly aggressive in my counter.
* **Maintaining Walk-Away Option:**  I'm still positioned to accept John's offer if needed, so I'm not pressured into accepting a lower offer from Bob."
