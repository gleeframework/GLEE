"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product which I believe you might be interested in. I'm asking for $180 to start. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $180 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $80?"", ""product_price"": 80}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that my initial offer might have been a bit high. How about we meet in the middle somewhere around $130? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down a bit, Alice. However, $130 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. Could you do $90?"", ""product_price"": 90}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm trying to be flexible here, but I have to be fair to myself as well.  $110 is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** Alice is holding firm and unlikely to go much lower than $110.  While you *might* be able to get the price down a little more, it's not worth the risk of her sticking to her ""final offer"" and you ending up having to pay more than John's price."
