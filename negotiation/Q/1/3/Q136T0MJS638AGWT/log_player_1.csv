Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 175}
```

I'm starting with a price higher than what the product is worth to Bob, but not too much higher. This gives me some room to negotiate down if Bob makes a counteroffer. However, it's also high enough that if he immediately rejects, I can go to John and still get my minimum value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is my minimum, but I can likely do better.  I'll reject and see if I can get him to budge a bit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 165}
```

I'm lowering my price a bit, but not all the way to Bob's offer. I'm hoping he'll see that I'm willing to compromise, but that I still value the product at a higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob is firm on his price, and I've already lowered my offer twice.  At this point, I'm not likely to get more than $150 from Bob.  I'm better off selling to John and getting my minimum value."
