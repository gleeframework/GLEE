Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1800000}
```

This offer sets the price at $1,800,000, significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest and potential willingness to pay.  If he rejects, I can adjust my offer based on his counteroffer, always keeping in mind my minimum acceptable price and the possibility of selling to John for $1,200,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. While it's tempting to accept given the possibility of no deal at all, rejecting the offer allows me to make a counteroffer that is still higher than John's offer, giving me a better chance of maximizing profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

My counteroffer is $1,500,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer, giving Bob a better price while still ensuring I get more than John's offer. I believe this price point demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while remaining firm in my desire to secure a profitable deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is my minimum acceptable price. It's tempting to keep negotiating, hoping for a higher price. However, there's a risk that Bob might reject any further counteroffers, and I'd be left with John's offer, which is the same.  Accepting Bob's offer guarantees a sale at my minimum acceptable price, ensuring I don't lose out on potential profits."
