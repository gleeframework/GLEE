"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I know you'd love. I'm asking for $140 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly lower than the maximum I think Bob would pay, leaving room for negotiation. This gives me a good starting point and allows for some potential back-and-forth."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but $140 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $130 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's tempting to accept, I'm confident that I can get a better price. I'll counter with a price slightly lower than my initial offer to show I'm open to negotiating but still want to make a profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $130 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $135? I'm sure we can find a price we both agree on."", ""product_price"": 135}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your perspective, but $135 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $130, and I think that's a fair price considering the product's value. Can you reconsider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob is persistent on his offer of $130. While it's lower than I initially hoped for, I am already on my 4th round of negotiation and I don't want to risk losing him completely. I am confident I can still get a better price from him than what John is offering. Accepting his offer allows me to move on and potentially negotiate with other buyers in the future if I have more products to sell."
