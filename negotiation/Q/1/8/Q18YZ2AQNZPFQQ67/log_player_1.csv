"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer, hoping to get the best possible price.  I'm also aware of John's offer, so I'm not afraid to walk away if Bob doesn't come close to my expectations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$8,000 is far too low for me. I'll reject his offer and try to get closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000} 
```

I'm lowering my price a bit, but I'm still aiming for a decent profit. I'm hoping that Bob will see the value in my product and be willing to pay closer to my target price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm still hoping for a better price than $9,500. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my target in the next round.  John is a good backup, but I'm not ready to sell to him yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm lowering my price again, but I'm still confident that I can get a good deal. Bob seems interested, and I want to see if we can meet in the middle."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This is a good deal for me! While I'd prefer a slightly higher price, Bob is getting closer to my expectations and it's better than settling for John's offer. I'm going to accept Bob's offer and finalize the sale."
