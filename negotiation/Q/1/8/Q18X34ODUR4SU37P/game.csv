"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which we believe would greatly benefit you. Considering its value, I propose a price of $130 for it. This includes a special introductory discount compared to our regular pricing. Let me know if this works for you!",130.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer Alice, I appreciate the discount. However, $130 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $105 for the product. Let me know what you think.",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your budget constraints. I'd like to make a counterproposal: I'll sell the product to you for $115. This is still above your initial offer but below my original proposal, aiming to find a mutually beneficial solution. Please let me know if this revised price works for you.",115.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $115 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. I'm willing to go up to $110.  This is a fair compromise and I'm hoping we can close the deal.",110.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. Considering the value of the product and your budget, I am willing to sell the product to you for $108. This is a fair compromise, and I hope it allows us to reach an agreement.",108.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, $108 is still a little too high for me. I'm willing to pay $105 for the product. It's my final offer. Let me know if you accept.",105.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Considering the value of the product and your last offer, I am willing to sell the product to you for $106. This is the lowest price I can offer while still ensuring a reasonable profit for myself. I hope this helps us reach an agreement.",106.0,Alice,7,
