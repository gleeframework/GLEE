Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $700,000. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm afraid I need to make a profit, and $700,000 is a bit low for me.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $750,000 is still a bit above your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to compromise again, so I'm counteroffering at $820,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and your previous offers.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to go up to $780,000. I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're getting close to the end of our negotiation, and I'd like to make a strong case for why this product is worth more. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $780,000 and my original offer of $900,000. I'm counteroffering at $890,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident that it's a fair price for the product's value.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $890,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

Alice is getting further from a reasonable price and seems to be trying to manipulate me with the ""final offer"" tactic and talking about how much the product is worth *to her*. I'm better off taking the guaranteed deal with John at this point."
