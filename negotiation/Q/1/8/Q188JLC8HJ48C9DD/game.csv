"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with a price of $900,000. Is this something you'd like to consider?",900000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable,  $900,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider  $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $700,000. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm afraid I need to make a profit, and $700,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $850,000. Is this more in line with what you're willing to pay?",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  To be honest, $850,000 is still a little steep for my budget.  How about $750,000? I think that's a fair offer.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $750,000 is still a bit above your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to compromise again, so I'm counteroffering at $820,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and your previous offers.",820000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for continuing to negotiate. I'm getting closer to my limit, but I can go up to $780,000.  Let me know what you think.",780000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to go up to $780,000. I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're getting close to the end of our negotiation, and I'd like to make a strong case for why this product is worth more. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $780,000 and my original offer of $900,000. I'm counteroffering at $890,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident that it's a fair price for the product's value.",890000.0,Alice,7,
