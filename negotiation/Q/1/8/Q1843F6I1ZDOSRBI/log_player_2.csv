# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am excited to present our premium product to you. After careful consideration, we believe it would be beneficial for both of us if you were to consider acquiring this exceptional item. We are offering it to you at a special introductory price of $1,300,000.

``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $1,300,000 is less than Alice's valuation, it's still above Bob's maximum budget.  It's worth trying to negotiate further."

# Alice's message: Thank you for your prompt response, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to engage in negotiations.

Alice's counteroffer is still above Bob's maximum budget of $1,200,000.  However, it's closer to Bob's desired price, and there's still room for further negotiation.  Bob can try to lower the price even further by making a counteroffer."
