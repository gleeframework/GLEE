{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair price, considering the value it holds for you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:** Giving Bob some room to negotiate, making him feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **It's below your minimum acceptable value:** You still stand to make a significant profit while potentially closing a deal faster. 

Keep in mind, you have the option to sell to John for $1,500,000 at any time, so don't be afraid to push for a higher price if Bob's counteroffer is too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,300,000 for your product. I hope this aligns better with my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below your minimum acceptable value:**  While it's closer to your desired price, you're still losing out on a significant amount of money. 
* **There's potential to get a better price:** You can counteroffer with a higher price, potentially closer to your desired $1,400,000 or even a little higher, hoping to close the gap.
* **You can always sell to John:** This option provides a safety net, ensuring you don't settle for a price that's too low for your product's worth."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,300,000 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $1,350,000? It's a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find the product very valuable. "", ""product_price"": 1350000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** This counteroffer is a compromise that shows you're willing to negotiate but still maintains a healthy profit for you. 
* **Staying above your minimum:**  $1,350,000 is still above your minimum acceptable value of $1,500,000.
* **Positive and encouraging:**  The message emphasizes the value of the product and the potential for a win-win situation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. However, I am not willing to go beyond $1,300,000 for this product. Could we possibly meet somewhere in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob is firm on his price:**  He's repeatedly offered $1,300,000, and it seems unlikely he'll budge further. 
* **Your minimum is not met:**  You're not comfortable selling at $1,300,000, as it falls below your minimum acceptable value.
* **John offers a guaranteed profit:**  Selling to John guarantees you your desired profit and eliminates the risk of further negotiation with Bob.  

While continuing to negotiate with Bob might result in a slightly better price, the risk of him ultimately not accepting any further counteroffers is too high. Selling to John provides a safe and secure outcome."
