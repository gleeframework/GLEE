"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think you'll really love it. Would you like to make an offer for it? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
It's best not to accept the first offer. Alice knows her product is worth less to you and there's room for negotiation. Let's see if we can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider a lower price?"", 
""product_price"": 8000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  I'm starting with a significantly lower offer ($8,000) to gauge Alice's flexibility. This leaves room for negotiation and signals that I'm looking for a good deal. 
* **Polite and Positive:** I maintain a polite and friendly tone to encourage a positive negotiation atmosphere."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a better price, Bob. However, I've already made a significant concession from my initial offer. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. Would you consider $10,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Our Goal:** Alice has come down to our target price of $10,000.  
* **No Guarantee of a Better Deal:** While we might be able to negotiate a slightly lower price with more rounds, there's no guarantee, and we risk Alice withdrawing the offer altogether.
* **John's Price:** Accepting this offer means we pay the same as we would with John, so there's no advantage to switching sellers."
