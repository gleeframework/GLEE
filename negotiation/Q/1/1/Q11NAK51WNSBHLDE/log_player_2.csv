"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, as you know it's worth much more to you.  Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $14,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $11,000?"",
""product_price"": 11000
}
```

This counter-offer is a strong starting point. Here's why:

* **Significant but not insulting:** It's a substantial decrease from Alice's offer, showing I'm serious about a deal but not lowballing her.
* **Below my max:** It leaves me room to negotiate upwards while still staying well below my $15,000 maximum and John's offer.
* **Opens the door:** It encourages Alice to counter-offer, keeping the negotiation moving."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $11,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to compromise. How about $13,000?  That's still a great deal for you considering its value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Alice is moving closer to a price I like, I still have room to negotiate before hitting my $15,000 walk-away point. I'll continue the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. I'm getting closer, but $13,000 is still a bit of a stretch.  Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $12,000?"",
""product_price"": 12000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** This counter-offer proposes a price directly in between our last offers, signaling fairness and a desire to reach an agreement. 
* **Targeting her value:** I know Alice values the product at $12,000, so this offer is her break-even point. While she might want more profit, it's unlikely she'll walk away completely.
* **Limited time pressure:** I still have several rounds to negotiate if needed, so there's no need to rush or concede too much yet."
