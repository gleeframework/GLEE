"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to part with it for $800,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value to you is $1,500,000. What do you think?",800000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, that price is a little high for me. Would you consider $500,000?",500000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand you're looking to get a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $500,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll consider selling the product for $700,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you is $1,500,000. What do you think?",700000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. How about we settle at $600,000? I think that's a fair compromise.",600000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to find a compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with $600,000. I'm willing to give you a slight discount, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good return on my investment. I'll consider selling the product for $650,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go. What do you think?",650000.0,Alice,5,
