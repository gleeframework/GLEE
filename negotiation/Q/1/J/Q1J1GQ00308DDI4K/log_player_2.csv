"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for a special price of $9,500. I think it's a great value, and I'm confident you'll love it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Here's why:

* **Alice's Offer:** $9,500
* **John's Offer:** $12,000
* **Your Maximum:** $12,000

While Alice's offer is better than John's, you know you can get the product for less. By rejecting her offer, you might be able to negotiate a lower price with Alice or leave the door open for a better offer in the future."
