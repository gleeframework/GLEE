"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the enthusiasm!  I'm interested, but I'm going to need to come in a bit lower.  How about $1050000? I think that's a fair price for both of us. ",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not quite comfortable with the price you mentioned. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about we discuss $1300000? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $1300000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1150000. That's a good middle ground, and it gives us both a fair deal. What do you think?",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Bob! I'm glad we're having a good conversation. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $1150000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. How about we try $1250000? I think it's a fair price that reflects the product's value and gives us both a good deal.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
