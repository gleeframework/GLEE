Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not quite comfortable with the price you mentioned. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about we discuss $1300000? I think that's a fair price for both of us.

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is still better than buying from John, but we can try to get a lower price. It's worth negotiating further to see if we can get closer to our desired price point."

{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $1,300,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,150,000. That's a good middle ground, and it gives us both a fair deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1150000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Bob! I'm glad we're having a good conversation. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $1150000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. How about we try $1250000? I think it's a fair price that reflects the product's value and gives us both a good deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $1,250,000 is still better than buying from John for $1,500,000. It's also within a reasonable range of our desired price point. While we could continue negotiating, there's a risk of Alice walking away or becoming less flexible. Accepting this offer is the most logical choice to secure the product at a reasonable price."
