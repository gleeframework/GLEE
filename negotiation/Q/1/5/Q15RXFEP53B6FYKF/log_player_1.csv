"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm, Alice, but $1,000,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $600,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

Round 3

{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I want to make this work for both of us.  How about we settle at $850,000? This reflects the true value of the product while acknowledging your willingness to negotiate."",

}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but $850,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $700,000, but I think that's as high as I can go. I hope we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

``` 

We're still too far from Bob's valuation of the product. It's worth holding out a bit longer to see if we can negotiate a better deal.  We're getting closer to John's offer, but there's still room to push for a higher price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence in finding a price that works.  Let's split the difference - $775,000. This reflects a fair compromise, wouldn't you agree?"",

}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the effort to find a compromise, Alice, but $775,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $700,000 and $775,000, which would be $737,500. Can we agree on that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $737,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $737,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is getting closer, we're still leaving money on the table.  He's clearly willing to go above $700,000, and we have some room to negotiate before hitting John's offer.  There's a chance to push for a bit more in the next few rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're clearly serious about this purchase, and I respect that. How about we make this the final push - $760,000.  It's a strong offer that reflects the value of this product."",

}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but $760,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $725,000, but I think that's as high as I can go. Can we meet in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $725,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

It's time to cut our losses. Bob is incrementally increasing his offer, but at this rate, we're unlikely to reach a significantly better deal within the remaining rounds. John's offer of $800,000 is now more appealing than continuing to negotiate with Bob, especially considering the risk that he might not budge much higher than his current offer."
