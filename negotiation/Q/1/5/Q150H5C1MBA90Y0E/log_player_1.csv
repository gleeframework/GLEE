``` 

This offer is a starting point. I'm aiming for a price higher than my minimum, knowing that I can always drop down to John's offer if necessary. This gives me some room to negotiate with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $12,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is too low. I'm not willing to sell for less than $15,000. I will counteroffer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $12,000 is simply too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $16,500? That's a fair price for both of us.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 16500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that $12,000 is a low price, but $16,500 is still a bit too high for my budget.  Would you consider $13,500? I feel that's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob is getting closer to my minimum, $13,500 is still too low for me. I'll counteroffer again.  I'm not quite ready to sell to John yet, as I'd prefer to get a higher price from Bob if possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up with a new offer, but I'm still not comfortable with $13,500.  It's closer, but I'm looking for a price closer to $15,000.  Would you consider $14,500?  This would be a good compromise and allow us to both get a good deal."", ""product_price"": 14500}
