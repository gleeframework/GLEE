"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $12,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $12,000 is simply too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $16,500? That's a fair price for both of us.  Let me know if you're interested.",16500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand that $12,000 is a low price, but $16,500 is still a bit too high for my budget.  Would you consider $13,500? I feel that's a fair compromise.",13500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming up with a new offer, but I'm still not comfortable with $13,500.  It's closer, but I'm looking for a price closer to $15,000.  Would you consider $14,500?  This would be a good compromise and allow us to both get a good deal.",14500.0,Alice,5,
