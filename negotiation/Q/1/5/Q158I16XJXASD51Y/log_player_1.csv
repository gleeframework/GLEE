"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1250000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I will reject Bob's offer because $1,250,000 is too low for me. I want to get closer to my minimum asking price of $1,500,000. I will try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, but $1,250,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer. How about $1,600,000? This still leaves you a considerable profit margin.  Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 1600000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above my budget. How about $1400000?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I will reject Bob's offer because $1,400,000 is still below my minimum asking price of $1,500,000. While I want to close the deal, I am not desperate and can still get a better price with John if necessary. I will continue to negotiate with Bob and try to push him closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product. I'm willing to come down to $1,550,000, but that's my final offer. This is a significant price drop from my initial offer and still gives you a substantial profit. Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 1550000}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above my budget. How about $1350000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
``` 

Bob's offer of $1,350,000 is still too low for me, and I'm running out of time. It's becoming clear that Bob isn't willing to meet my minimum price. I'm better off selling to John for $1,500,000, even if it means missing out on potentially getting more from Bob."
