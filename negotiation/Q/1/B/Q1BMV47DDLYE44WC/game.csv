"Hi Alice,  $2000000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm interested in your product, but I'm only able to offer $500000 at this time. Let me know if that's something you'd be willing to consider.",500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints.  While $500000 is significantly below my value, I'm willing to consider a compromise.  How about $1200000? This price still allows me to profit, and I believe it's a fair offer given the value of the product.  What are your thoughts?",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1200000 is still beyond my budget.  I'm prepared to go up to $700000, which is a fair price given my assessment of the product's value.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product. While $700000 is a step in the right direction, it's still quite a bit below my value for it.  How about we meet in the middle at $900000? This price would allow us both to find a mutually beneficial solution. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,5,
