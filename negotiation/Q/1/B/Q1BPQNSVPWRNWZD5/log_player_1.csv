Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000.  This is a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

This offer maximizes my potential profit while remaining realistic.  If Bob accepts, I get the full value. If he rejects, I can then gauge his interest and proceed accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your product is enticing, but that price is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to offer $700,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is tempting,  it's significantly lower than my desired price point and my minimum value for the product.  I'll reject it and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $700,000 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000 to meet you halfway.  Let's see if we can strike a deal."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  How about we settle on $800,000? That feels like a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $800,000 is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum value. I'll try one more counteroffer to see if I can get closer to my goal before selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $800,000 still isn't quite there for me. I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This is a significant compromise, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 850000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you're right, this is a fair price for both of us. Let's settle this negotiation at $825,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd prefer a higher price, $825,000 is a good compromise that allows me to make a decent profit.  Further negotiation might not yield a better result, and I risk losing Bob's interest altogether.  It's time to secure the deal."
