"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $700,000 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000 to meet you halfway.  Let's see if we can strike a deal.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $800,000 still isn't quite there for me. I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This is a significant compromise, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. What do you say?",850000.0,Alice,5,
