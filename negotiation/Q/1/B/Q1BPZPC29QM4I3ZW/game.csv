"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,200,000 is still a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to offer $1,050,000 for the product. I believe this price reflects the value of the product for me and allows for a profitable deal for both of us.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,050,000 is a bit below my target price. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering the product at $1,175,000. This price still reflects the value of the product to me, but it's a compromise that I'm willing to make to reach a deal. I believe this price is fair and reasonable, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",1175000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further, but $1,175,000 is still outside my budget. I'm prepared to offer $1,100,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price, considering the value of the product and the fact that it's significantly closer to my maximum budget.  I'm hopeful we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
