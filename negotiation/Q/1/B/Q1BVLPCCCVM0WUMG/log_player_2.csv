Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your persistence, and I'm willing to meet you halfway again. However, I'm still not comfortable going below $1,100,000. I'd like to counteroffer at $1,100,500. This is a very slight increase, but I believe it's a fair compromise considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,500

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Alice is clearly very reluctant to go below $1,100,000.  While we could try to negotiate further, she's only asking $500 more than our target. Accepting this offer minimizes the risk of her walking away and provides a significant savings compared to John's price."
