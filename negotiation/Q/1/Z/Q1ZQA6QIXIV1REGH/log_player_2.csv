"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you this unique product at a price of $2000000. I believe it has immense potential value, and I'm confident you'll see the same. Let's discuss this further and see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $2,000,000 is way above his budget, and he can get the same product from John for a much lower price. There's no reason to accept this offer unless he believes the product is truly worth more than $1,000,000 (and even then, he should counteroffer)."

{""message"": ""Alice, your initial offer is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm very interested in the product, but I can't go higher than $1,000,000.  This is a fair price considering I could purchase the same product from another seller for that amount.  Let me know if you're willing to negotiate."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1000000 is significantly below the true value of this product. I'm willing to compromise, but I can't go lower than $1750000. This price reflects the unique features and potential of this product.  I'm confident you'll find it to be a worthwhile investment. Let's see if we can bridge the gap. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,750,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $1,750,000 is better than Alice's initial offer, it's still above Bob's budget and what he can get from John.  Bob should reject this offer and counter with a lower price, aiming to get closer to his $1,000,000 target."
