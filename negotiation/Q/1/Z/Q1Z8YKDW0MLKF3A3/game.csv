"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While I understand your offer, I'm not quite ready to accept that price. I'm willing to come down to $11,200, which still reflects the value of the product. I believe this is a fair compromise, and I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement.",11200.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but I'm still a little far from where I need to be. To make this work, I'm willing to drop my price to $11,000. This is my final offer.  If it doesn't work for you, I'll need to move on to another buyer. ",11000.0,Alice,5,
