Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a great deal, and I think it would be a valuable asset to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:** I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's valuation of $10,000, giving him room to negotiate.
* **Room for Negotiation:** This price leaves room for a counteroffer from Bob, potentially leading to a compromise.
* **Alternative Option:**  I'm aware I have a fallback option in John who's willing to pay my minimum price, so I'm not afraid to walk away if Bob's counteroffers are too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $10,800. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Counteroffer:** Bob's counteroffer of $10,800 is still significantly lower than my desired price of $12,000.
* **Negotiation Potential:** While I could accept this offer, I believe there's still potential to negotiate a higher price.
* **John as Backup:**  My fallback option with John gives me the security to continue negotiating with Bob without pressure.

**Next Steps:** I will now counteroffer Bob with a price closer to my desired price, but still taking into account his willingness to pay."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While I understand your offer, I'm not quite ready to accept that price. I'm willing to come down to $11,200, which still reflects the value of the product. I believe this is a fair compromise, and I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 11200}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** I've countered with a price that's halfway between my previous offer ($11,500) and Bob's offer ($10,800). This shows a willingness to compromise while still aiming for a price closer to my desired value.
* **Maintaining Value:** I'm emphasizing the value of the product, implying that this price is still reasonable given its worth.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a positive tone to encourage further negotiation and avoid appearing too rigid.

This approach aims to find a mutually beneficial agreement while keeping my fallback option with John in mind."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $10,900. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,900
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close, but Not Enough:** While Bob's counteroffer is closer to my desired price, it's still significantly lower than my minimum value of $12,000. 
* **Negotiation Fatigue:**  At this point, the negotiation is getting increasingly tedious, and I'm not sure further negotiation will yield a satisfactory result.
* **John's Offer:**  My fallback option with John is still available, guaranteeing me my minimum desired price.

**Next Steps:** I will now make a final counteroffer to Bob, trying to bridge the gap further. If he rejects, I will immediately sell the product to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but I'm still a little far from where I need to be. To make this work, I'm willing to drop my price to $11,000. This is my final offer.  If it doesn't work for you, I'll need to move on to another buyer. "", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:**  I'm explicitly stating this is my final offer, signaling to Bob that I'm serious about closing the deal.
* **Bridging the Gap:** I'm making a small concession, moving closer to Bob's offer, but still maintaining a price closer to my desired value.
* **Emphasis on Time:** I'm highlighting the urgency by mentioning other buyers, subtly pressuring Bob to make a decision.

This approach aims to close the deal with a final offer while keeping the option to move to John if Bob refuses."
