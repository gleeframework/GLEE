"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $2000000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value and rarity. What do you think?",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but $2000000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. Can you meet me in the middle?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $2000000 might be a stretch for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1200000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a bit more profit. How about we settle on $1700000? It's a compromise that I think is fair for both of us.",1700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but $1700000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'm willing to go up to $1500000, which is the maximum I'm willing to pay. Can you meet me at that price?",1500000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're willing to go up to $1500000, Bob, but I'm not willing to sell the product for that price. I'm willing to make one more compromise. How about we meet at $1550000? It's the highest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a fair deal for both of us.",1550000.0,Alice,5,
