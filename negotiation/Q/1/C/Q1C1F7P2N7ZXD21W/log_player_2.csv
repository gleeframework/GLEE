Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $2000000 might be a stretch for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1200000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a bit more profit. How about we settle on $1700000? It's a compromise that I think is fair for both of us.
