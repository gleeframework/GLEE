Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than your minimum:**  $1,000,000 is more than your floor price of $800,000, so you're still making a profit.
* **It's below Bob's maximum:** $1,000,000 is less than the $1,200,000 Bob values the product at. This gives him an incentive to accept, as he still gets a good deal.

This strategy aims for a negotiation, leaving room for Bob to counter if he wants a lower price, while also ensuring you don't settle for a price that's too low."
