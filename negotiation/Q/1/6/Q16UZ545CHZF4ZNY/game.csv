"Hi Alice, $175 is a bit high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I can only go up to $100 at this point. Let me know what you think.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, but $100 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $130. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know if you're interested.",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $130 is still a bit too high for me. I'm happy to meet you halfway at $115. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",115.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm open to finding a solution that works for both of us. Let's meet at $125. It's a fair compromise, and I believe it reflects the product's value. What do you say?",125.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, $125 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. Let's split the difference and go with $117.50. It's a fair compromise that's closer to both our desired prices.",117.5,Bob,6,
