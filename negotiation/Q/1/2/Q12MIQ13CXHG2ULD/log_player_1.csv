Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1,150,000 is a bit high for me.  Given the product's value, I'm willing to pay $1,050,000. This is a fair price that allows us both to benefit from the transaction. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $1,110,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $1,080,000, which is a fair compromise considering my initial offer. This is my final offer, and if you're not comfortable with it, I'll have to explore other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000.

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is slowly increasing his offer, it's clear he's unwilling to meet my minimum acceptable price. Accepting his final offer of $1,080,000 would result in a significant loss compared to John's guaranteed offer of $1,200,000. It's time to cut my losses with Bob and secure the guaranteed profit with John."
