It's always worth trying to negotiate a lower price. Even a small discount would be a win for Bob."

I'm starting with a significant discount of $500. This shows Alice that I'm serious about negotiating and gives us a good starting point."

Alice is moving in the right direction, but there's still room to negotiate.  I'll try to push for a lower price."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

I'm going to counter with $7600. This is a smaller step than before, showing Alice that I'm willing to compromise while still trying to get a good deal."

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice is getting closer to my ideal price. While I could try to push for a lower offer, there's a risk she'll reject it and we might end up with a worse deal. Accepting this offer means I save $350, which is a good outcome."
