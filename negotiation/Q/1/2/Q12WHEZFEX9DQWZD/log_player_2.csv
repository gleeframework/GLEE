"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

You're aiming to save as much money as possible. $12,000 is a decent starting point, but there's room for negotiation. You can likely get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is a strong opening counteroffer.  It's significantly lower than Alice's initial price, showing your commitment to getting a good deal. It's also important to remember that Alice's minimum price is $10,000, so this counteroffer is within a reasonable range."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to your desired price, but it's still above your target.  There's still room for negotiation, and you don't want to settle for a price that leaves money on the table."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Reasoning:**

You're steadily increasing your offer, showing that you're serious about buying the product.  $11,500 is a compromise between your previous offer and Alice's latest offer. It's still a good deal for you, and it might be tempting enough for Alice to accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting closer to your desired price, but it's still not ideal. You're close to the halfway point in your negotiations, and there's still potential for you to get a better price.  You've already shown Alice you're serious about buying, so she might be more willing to meet you halfway in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is a middle ground offer, showing Alice you're willing to compromise. It's still a significant saving for you, and it's getting closer to Alice's price, potentially pushing her to accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is closer to your target, but it's still not ideal. You're nearing the end of the negotiation rounds, but you can still try to push for a better price. You've shown willingness to compromise, and Alice might be more inclined to meet you halfway in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is your final push.  You're increasing your offer again, showing Alice that you're serious about buying. $12,500 is a good compromise and is likely close enough to Alice's desired price that she'll accept, especially with only two rounds left. If she rejects, you're prepared to go to John, but this should be your last counteroffer before you move on."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $14,000 is too high for you. It's only $1,000 less than buying from John, and you're down to your final round. The potential gain from further negotiation is too small to risk losing the product. You're better off buying from John and securing the product at a predictable price."
