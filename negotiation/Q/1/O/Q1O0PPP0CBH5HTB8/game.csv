"I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for it. Can you consider that?",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $9,500 is still below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let's meet in the middle.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,500 and $11,000. Can we do $10,250?",10250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,250 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,750. That's a significant compromise from my previous offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product to you.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",10750.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $10,500, which is a bit closer to your latest offer. Can we meet in the middle again?",10500.0,Bob,6,
