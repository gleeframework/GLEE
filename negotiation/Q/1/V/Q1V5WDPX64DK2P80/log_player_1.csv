{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $140. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're getting more than your minimum of $120.
* **It's below Bob's maximum:** You're leaving room for negotiation, as Bob values the product at $150.
* **It's a reasonable price:** $140 is a fair price for both parties. 

By starting with this offer, you've maximized your chances of getting a good price while keeping the negotiation open."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $140 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay right now. How about $130? It's still a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is better than selling to John, there's still room for negotiation.  Since the product is worth $150 to Bob, there's a chance he might be willing to pay a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your counteroffer.  However, $130 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference at $135?  That way, we both get a fair price, and I can avoid selling to another buyer."", ""product_price"": 135}
