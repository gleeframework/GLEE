"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $140. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it. What do you think?",140.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $140 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay right now. How about $130? It's still a fair price for both of us.",130.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your counteroffer.  However, $130 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference at $135?  That way, we both get a fair price, and I can avoid selling to another buyer.",135.0,Alice,3,
