Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $140 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay right now. How about $130? It's still a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 130}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your counteroffer.  However, $130 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference at $135?  That way, we both get a fair price, and I can avoid selling to another buyer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

$135 is a good deal considering John is selling it for $150 and Alice is willing to sell for $120.  It's a win-win."
