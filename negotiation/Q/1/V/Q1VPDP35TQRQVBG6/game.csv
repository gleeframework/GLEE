"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $120. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. What do you think?",120.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm really interested in the product, but $120 is a bit too high for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $105?",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $105 is still a bit lower than I'd like to go.  How about we split the difference and go with $110? It's still a good deal for you, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to make a profit, but $110 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $95 for the product. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle again, but closer to my budget this time.",95.0,Bob,4,
