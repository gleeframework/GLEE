"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 140}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer, just below Bob's perceived value. This gives me room to negotiate down if necessary, but hopefully entices him to accept quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. $130 is still a good price, but I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price point.  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 135}
```

I'm meeting Bob halfway with this offer. It's a compromise that shows I'm willing to negotiate, but it still gets me closer to my goal of $140."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer again. While $125 is still above my minimum, I'm hoping to get closer to $130. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}

I'm sticking to my guns here and offering $130 again. This shows Bob I'm firm on my price, and hopefully he'll finally accept it."

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

It seems Bob is not willing to budge on his price, and I've already made several concessions.  With only four rounds left, I'm not confident I'll be able to get a better deal with Bob.  It's time to cut my losses and sell to John."
