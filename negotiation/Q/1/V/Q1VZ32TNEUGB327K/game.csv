"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I'm looking to stay within a budget of $800,000. Considering the product's value, I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a counteroffer of $900,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that still recognizes the product's unique benefits. What are your thoughts?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I understand your position, however, the value of this product significantly exceeds that amount.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,050,000. This reflects its true worth and the potential returns it offers.  Let me know if this works for you.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and propose a counteroffer of $950,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that balances the product's value with my budget constraints. What are your thoughts?",950000.0,Bob,4,
