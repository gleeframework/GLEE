"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a unique asset that will bring significant value to your business. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. Let me know if this is something you'd like to consider. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:**  The product is worth $800,000 to Alice, and she's offering it for $900,000. This means there's room for negotiation.
* **You have a higher ceiling:**  You're willing to pay up to $1,200,000, so you have more flexibility to negotiate a lower price.
* **Counter-offering is a good strategy:**  Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better deal."

{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of this product, I'm looking to secure it for a price closer to $750,000. This would allow me to maximize the potential return on my investment. Let's see if we can find common ground here."", ""product_price"": 750000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your desire to secure the product at a price that aligns with your investment goals. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $950,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the market demand. Let me know if this is more in line with what you're looking for. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is still too high:**  While Alice has moved closer to your desired price, she's still offering $950,000, which is above your target of $750,000.
* **There's still room for negotiation:** You're willing to pay up to $1,200,000, so there's a considerable gap between your desired price and your maximum.
* **Counter-offering is a good strategy:** Rejecting Alice's offer allows you to make another counteroffer and try to reach a mutually acceptable price."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  $950,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $850,000, which is a significant step toward your asking price. This would be a fair compromise, allowing us both to benefit from the transaction."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. I'm glad we're getting closer to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to meet you at $875,000, which is a slight increase from my previous offer. This price still reflects the value of the product, while also acknowledging your investment goals. Let me know if this is acceptable to you.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to your target:** Alice's offer of $875,000 is only $25,000 above your last counteroffer of $850,000.
* **Negotiation is getting harder:** Alice is showing less willingness to budge, and you're approaching the point where it might be better to accept a deal than risk further negotiation.
* **Saving a significant amount:** By accepting this offer, you save $325,000 compared to buying from John. 

While you could try to counter-offer again, the potential savings are small compared to the risk of Alice rejecting your offer and leaving you with no deal."
