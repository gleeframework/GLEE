You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000

**Explanation:**

Alice's new offer of $1,300,000 is still higher than Bob's preferred price of $1,200,000, but it is now lower than the price John is offering. Given that Bob wants to get the product, accepting Alice's offer is the best choice. It will save Bob $50,000 compared to buying from John."
