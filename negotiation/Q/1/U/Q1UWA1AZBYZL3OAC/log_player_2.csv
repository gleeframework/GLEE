"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $95. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You are willing to pay up to $100 for the product.  Alice's offer of $95 is better than John's price of $100, but you can still do better. By rejecting Alice's offer, you can potentially negotiate a lower price with Alice or buy from another seller."
