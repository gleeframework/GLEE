Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. That's the most I'm willing to pay for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $9,500 is better than selling to John, I believe I can get closer to my desired price.  I'm going to try to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, but $9,500 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,500.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $10,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $10,000. Let's see if we can make a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I'd prefer a higher price, $10,000 is still a good deal for me, and it's better than selling to John for $8,000.  It's also a good compromise and shows Bob that I'm willing to negotiate."
