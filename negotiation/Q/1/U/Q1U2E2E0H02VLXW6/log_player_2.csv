Bob should reject Alice's offer. $20,000 is far beyond his budget of $8,000.  He should attempt to negotiate a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $8,000 is significantly below its true value. I could consider coming down to $17,000. This feels like a fair offer considering the quality and potential of this product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $17,000 is lower than her initial offer, it's still above his budget. He should continue negotiating to try and get closer to his desired price."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm trying to find a middle ground here. While $10,000 is still less than I'd like, I'm willing to accept $14,000. This is my final offer, as I do have other potential buyers. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000.

Bob should choose to buy from John.  While $14,000 is closer to his budget, it's still too high.  He can secure the product from John for a price he's comfortable with."
