"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $9,500. I believe it will be highly valuable to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob can get the product for $10,000 from John. Alice's offer is still too high, even though it's lower than John's price. Bob should reject and try to negotiate a lower price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $9,500 is a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $8,500. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your interest. I appreciate your offer, but I can't go as low as $8,500.  Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $9,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer of $9,000 is within Bob's budget ($10,000) and is a good compromise.** 
* **John's price of $10,000 would be more expensive.** 

By accepting Alice's offer, Bob saves $1,000 compared to buying from John."
