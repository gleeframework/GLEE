"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which is valued at $150 by me. Given its high quality and unique features, I believe it would be a valuable addition to your collection. Considering its worth to you might be around $100, I propose we strike a deal that benefits both of us. Would you like to purchase it for $120? This way, you save $30 compared to my initial valuation, while I receive more than its value to me.",120.0,Alice,1,
