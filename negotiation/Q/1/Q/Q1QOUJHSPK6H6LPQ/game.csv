"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit to $9,500.  This is still a good price for you, and it's closer to what I need.  Let's see if we can make this work!",9500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you need to get a good price, but $9,500 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $9,000, which is a fair compromise.  Let's see if we can make this work. ",9000.0,Bob,4,
