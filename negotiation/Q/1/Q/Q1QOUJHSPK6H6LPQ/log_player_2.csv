"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. This is a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $10,000 is better than Alice's initial value of $12,000, it's still above my maximum budget of $8,000.  I'll reject the offer and see if I can negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your product, $10,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer that's halfway between my maximum budget and Alice's initial offer. This shows good faith and leaves room for negotiation in future rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit to $9,500.  This is still a good price for you, and it's closer to what I need.  Let's see if we can make this work! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price, $9,500 is still above my budget.  I'll reject her offer and try to negotiate a lower price in the next round. I'm still hopeful that we can reach a deal, but I'm getting closer to my limit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to get a good price, but $9,500 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $9,000, which is a fair compromise.  Let's see if we can make this work. "", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly to show that I'm serious about buying the product, but I'm still staying within my budget. This is a middle ground between my previous offer and Alice's latest offer."
