"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $125 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $130.  This still gives you a good price while allowing me to make a reasonable profit. What do you say?",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $130 is still a bit out of my range. I'm willing to go up to $128.  Let me know what you think.",128.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $128 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $129. This is a fair price for both of us, and I believe you'll find this product to be a worthwhile investment.  Let me know your thoughts.",129.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $129 is still a bit too high for me. How about $127?  That's the most I can offer without going over budget.",127.0,Bob,6,
