Bob should reject the offer.  While it's lower than John's price, there's room for negotiation. Bob can try to get a lower price from Alice."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $12,500. I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $14,000. This is my best price for now, but I'm open to further discussion.

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's lower than John's price, Bob can still try to negotiate a lower price. He has already shown Alice that he's willing to pay slightly more than her minimum price, so there's a possibility she might be willing to come down further."

Alice's offer:

Bob should accept Alice's offer. While it's not the absolute lowest price, it's a good compromise.  He's saving $750 compared to buying from John, and it's likely Alice won't go any lower. Further negotiation could drag on, and there's no guarantee he'll get a better deal."
