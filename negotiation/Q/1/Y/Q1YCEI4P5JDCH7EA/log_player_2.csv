"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth more than $12,000 to us, but I understand its value to you is around $10,000. Let's work together to find a fair price. How about we start at $9,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $9,500 is a good deal, Bob can potentially get it for even less. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $9,500 is still a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. Considering the value of the product to both of us, how about we aim for a price of $9,250? This allows us to both feel satisfied with the transaction. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible. While $9,250 is closer to his target price, he can still try to negotiate further. Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation going and gives Bob a chance to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your continued negotiation. While $9,250 is getting closer, I'm still aiming for a price that's more within my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $9,100. Let's work together to find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9100}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and am willing to compromise further. Considering the value of the product and our previous discussions, how about we set the price at $9,150? This should be a fair deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $9,150 is very close to Bob's target price of $9,000.  While Bob could continue negotiating, the risk of Alice rejecting his counteroffer and then potentially increasing her price is high. Accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product for a price that's within his budget and saves time and potential further negotiation."
