I'm starting with a significantly lower offer to get a sense of Alice's potential wiggle room. This gives us room to negotiate upwards while staying well below our $800,000 limit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $600,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $900,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to go, considering its value to me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $900,000 is closer to our ideal price, we're still above our absolute limit. There's room to negotiate further down towards the $800,000 we can get from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

{
 ""message"": ""I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  To be totally transparent, my budget for this product is capped. Would you be willing to come down a bit more, perhaps to $750,000?"",
 ""product_price"": 750000
}
```

Here's our reasoning:

* **Transparency:**  By mentioning a ""capped budget"" we signal to Alice that we're nearing our limit. It adds a sense of urgency without fully revealing our hand.
* **Targeted Offer:** $750,000 splits the difference between her current offer and our ideal price. This shows willingness to compromise while still leaving room for negotiation. 
* **John as Leverage:**  We haven't explicitly mentioned John, but the existence of his $800,000 offer underlies our negotiating position."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your transparency, Bob. However, $750,000 is still a bit below my minimum price. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to meet my minimum requirements. I can offer you the product for $950,000. This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

It's time to switch tactics. Alice has signaled this is her final offer and it's still significantly above our alternative.  She's unlikely to go much lower. Buying from John guarantees we stay within budget."
