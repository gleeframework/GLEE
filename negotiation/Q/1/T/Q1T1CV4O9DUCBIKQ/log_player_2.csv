You can do better than $110.  Let's see if we can get Alice down a little more."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you considering my budget.  I'm really interested in the product, but $110 is a bit outside of my price range.  How about $105?  That's the highest I can go right now."", ""product_price"": 105}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $105 is a bit tight for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can do $108, and that's as low as I can go. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $108
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Alice has come down to $108, which is still a good deal for me as it's below my $120 limit.  I'll take it!"
