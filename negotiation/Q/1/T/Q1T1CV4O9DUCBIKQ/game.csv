"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you considering my budget.  I'm really interested in the product, but $110 is a bit outside of my price range.  How about $105?  That's the highest I can go right now.",105.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $105 is a bit tight for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can do $108, and that's as low as I can go. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",108.0,Alice,3,
