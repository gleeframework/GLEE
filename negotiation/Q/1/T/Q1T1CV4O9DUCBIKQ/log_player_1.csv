# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you considering my budget.  I'm really interested in the product, but $110 is a bit outside of my price range.  How about $105?  That's the highest I can go right now. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
