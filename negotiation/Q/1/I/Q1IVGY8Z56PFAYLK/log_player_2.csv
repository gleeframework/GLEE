"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:** $95 is above your maximum budget of $100.
* **There's room for negotiation:** You can likely get a better price from Alice, especially since the product is worth $80 to her.
* **Buying from John is a backup:**  If negotiations with Alice fail, you have a guaranteed option with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 85}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting point:** I'm offering $85, which is a significant reduction from Alice's $95 and gives her a profit margin.
* **Fair compromise:** $85 is a good starting point for negotiation, as it's within my budget and likely acceptable to Alice. 
* **Pressure for a deal:** This counteroffer puts pressure on Alice to either accept or make a counteroffer, giving me more control over the negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still too high:** While $90 is lower than her initial offer, it's still above my ideal price point and leaves me less room for negotiation.
* **Testing the waters:**  Alice's counteroffer shows she's willing to negotiate further. This is an opportunity to see if I can get closer to my target price.
* **John is a safety net:**  I'm confident I can negotiate a better price with Alice. But if not, I have a backup plan with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 88}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bridging the gap:**  This counteroffer moves closer to Alice's offer of $90 while staying within my budget.
* **Signaling compromise:** It shows Alice that I'm willing to negotiate but also stand firm on my price point.
* **Testing the waters:** I want to see if Alice will accept this offer or if she's willing to come down further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still not ideal:** While $92 is getting closer to my desired price, it's still above my target and leaves me limited room for further negotiation.
* **Potential for better deal:**  Alice is showing a willingness to come down, suggesting there's still potential for a price closer to $85.
* **John's offer remains a fallback:**  Even if I don't get the best price from Alice, I have a guaranteed option with John to buy the product for $100."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** This offer is a compromise between my previous offer of $88 and Alice's offer of $92.
* **Signaling a willingness to close:** This offer shows Alice that I'm serious about buying the product and am willing to meet her halfway.
* **Time pressure:** We're approaching the halfway point of the negotiation, and I need to start closing the deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $94. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $94
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Limited negotiation space:** Alice's offer of $94 is very close to my maximum budget of $100, leaving little room for further bargaining.
* **Risk of stalemate:** With only 3 rounds remaining, there's a high risk of reaching a stalemate, where we both refuse to budge.
* **Time is running out:**  Continuing negotiations could lead to a wasted opportunity and potentially a higher price from John if he raises his price.

It's better to secure the product at John's offer of $100, ensuring a purchase and preventing further potential delays or price increases."
