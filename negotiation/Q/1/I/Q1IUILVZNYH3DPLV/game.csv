"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our initial offers. How about we discuss a price of $1,050,000?",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me. While $1,050,000 is closer, I'm aiming for a budget closer to $1,000,000. Would you consider $975,000?",975000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your desire to stay within your budget, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $975,000. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to make sure I get a good return on my investment. How about we meet at $1,025,000?",1025000.0,Alice,5,
