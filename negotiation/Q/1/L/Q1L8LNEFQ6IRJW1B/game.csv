"Alice,  while I appreciate your offer, $1,750,000 is significantly more than I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to offer you $1,200,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a compromise.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate you coming back with a counteroffer. While $1,200,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to compromise.  I'm willing to accept $1,400,000 for the product. This is still a good deal for both of us, and it allows us to move forward. What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your need to make a profit, but $1,400,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,300,000 for the product. It's a fair price that allows us both to benefit from the deal.",1300000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,300,000 is still unfortunately a bit too low for me. I'm firm on my previous offer of $1,400,000. This price is fair considering the product's value and allows for a win-win for both of us.  Let's find a way to make this work. ",1400000.0,Alice,5,
