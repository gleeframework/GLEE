Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,000,000 from John, so you won't accept anything less.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob, giving you room to negotiate above your minimum.
* **One-Shot Deal:**  You have one chance with Bob. If he rejects your offer, you go with your guaranteed sale.

**Offer Strategy**

You want to aim high but leave Bob feeling like he's getting a deal.  Offering a price slightly below his maximum value increases your chances of a successful sale.

**The Offer**

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Explanation**

* **Strong Opening:**  Highlights the ""exclusive opportunity"" and the product's value.
* **Strategic Pricing:** The price is $50,000 below Bob's perceived value, making it attractive.
* **Sense of Urgency:** The ""limited-time offer"" and mention of ""other interested parties"" encourage Bob to act quickly.

**Important Note:** Negotiation is dynamic.  Be prepared to adjust your approach based on Bob's response."
