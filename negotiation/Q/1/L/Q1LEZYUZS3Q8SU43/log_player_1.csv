{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,000.  It's a great deal, and I know you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value. This gives me some room to negotiate, but it's still a good deal for him.  I'm also being friendly and positive to build a good rapport."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,500. I'm really interested in the product, but I have to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is below my minimum value of $8,000. While I'd like to sell to Bob, I can't accept a price that low. I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $7,500 is just a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $8,500. This is a fair price that's still within your range, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 8500} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $8,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $8,250. I really think this is a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is now above my minimum price of $8,000. While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price,  $8,250 is a good compromise and allows me to sell the product quickly."
