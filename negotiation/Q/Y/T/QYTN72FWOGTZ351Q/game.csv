"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $850,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!",850000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, but I think the price is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product. I believe it's a fair price considering the market value.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $750,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to be closer to $825,000 to make this worthwhile.  Let's meet in the middle.",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand you're willing to come down, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $750,000 and $825,000. How about $787,500?",787500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $787,500 still doesn't quite work for me.  Let's split the difference again. How about $806,250?  That's a fair compromise and will allow both of us to walk away satisfied.",806250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to find a compromise, but $806,250 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but this time I'll go a bit lower. How about $793,750?",793750.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting closer!  I understand your position, but $793,750 isn't quite enough for me. How about $798,125?  That's a very small difference, and I'm willing to meet you there.",798125.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway again, but $798,125 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $795,000, which is the closest I can get to your price without going over my budget. Can you consider that?",795000.0,Bob,8,
