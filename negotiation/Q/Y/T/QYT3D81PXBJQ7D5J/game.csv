"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I'm interested in the product, $1,500,000 is a bit outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for it. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $1,250,000?",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,250,000 is still a bit steep for me.  I'm prepared to pay $1,100,000.  This is a fair price, considering I'm willing to buy the product right now, and it's a significant step closer to your asking price.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're serious about this purchase, and I'm motivated to close this deal.  Let's settle at $1,175,000. This represents a significant discount from my initial offer and acknowledges your willingness to negotiate.",1175000.0,Alice,5,
