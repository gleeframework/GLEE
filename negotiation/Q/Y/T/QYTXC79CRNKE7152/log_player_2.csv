**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your maximum budget of $1,500,000. It's better to reject and attempt to negotiate a lower price."

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,600,000 is still above my maximum budget of $1,500,000. While it's closer, it's still not a deal I can accept. I'll try to counteroffer again to see if we can reach a compromise."
