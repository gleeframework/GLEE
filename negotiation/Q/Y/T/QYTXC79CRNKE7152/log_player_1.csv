{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price higher than Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for bargaining. This strategy aims to maximize my profit while remaining open to a potential agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,750,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. Considering its value to me, I'd be willing to offer $1,400,000 for it. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price. By rejecting his offer, I can counter with a higher price and potentially reach a more favorable agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,400,000 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to at least get $1,600,000 to make this worthwhile. Let's find a compromise we both agree on."", ""product_price"": 1600000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,600,000 is still a bit high for me. How about we split the difference and settle at $1,550,000? This would be a fair compromise for both of us. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,550,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $1,550,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price and significantly higher than what John is offering.  It's a good deal and I'm happy to accept it."
