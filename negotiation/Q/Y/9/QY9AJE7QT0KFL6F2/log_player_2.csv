"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering this product to you at a price of $14,000. I believe it offers significant value at this price point. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is way above your maximum price. You should definitely counter-offer, aiming to get closer to your target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer but $14,000 is too high for me. I'm interested in the product but I have a budget of around $9,000. Would you consider a price in that range?"",
""product_price"": 9000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** This counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's asking price, but it anchors the negotiation closer to your desired range. 
* **Transparency:** By mentioning your budget, you're signaling your price ceiling, which can expedite the negotiation process.  
* **Polite and Professional:** Even though the counteroffer is low, maintaining a positive and respectful tone keeps the communication open."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is significantly below its value.  I'm willing to come down to $12,500. This is my best price and a fair offer considering the product's worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice came down a bit, but she's still above her value for the product. You have room to negotiate further. You're closer to your walk-away price with John ($10,000), so another counteroffer might push Alice to accept a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand the product's value, Alice, but I need to stick to my budget. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $10,750?  That's a fair compromise, I think."",
""product_price"": 10750
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** This counteroffer demonstrates a willingness to move closer to Alice's price while still staying within a reasonable range of your budget.
* **Midpoint:** Suggesting a price halfway between your last offer and Alice's last offer can signal a desire to find a mutually agreeable solution.
* **Final Push:** This might be your last offer before resorting to buying from John.  It keeps you in the game while subtly reminding Alice of your alternative option."
