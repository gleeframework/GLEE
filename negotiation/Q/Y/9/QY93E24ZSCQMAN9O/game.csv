"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $20,000 is out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for it.  Let me know if that works for you.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and counter-offer.  While I'm motivated to sell, $12,000 is significantly below its true value.  Could you consider $17,000? This feels like a fair compromise.",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks again for your flexibility. While I value the product, $17,000 is still a bit higher than I can comfortably pay. I'm willing to go up to $14,000. Let's see if we can bridge the gap.",14000.0,Bob,4,
