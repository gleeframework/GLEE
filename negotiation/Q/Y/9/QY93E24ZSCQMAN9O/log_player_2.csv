"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its unique value, I'm initially proposing a price of $20,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is far too high for Bob's budget.  It's in Bob's best interest to reject and counteroffer to start negotiations."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $20,000 is out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for it.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting his negotiation by making a reasonable counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial price but still leaves some room for compromise.  He's demonstrating that he's serious about buying the product but also has a firm budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and counter-offer.  While I'm motivated to sell, $12,000 is significantly below its true value.  Could you consider $17,000? This feels like a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is still too high for Bob's budget.  While she's come down from her initial price, it's still above Bob's maximum.  Bob should continue negotiating to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks again for your flexibility. While I value the product, $17,000 is still a bit higher than I can comfortably pay. I'm willing to go up to $14,000. Let's see if we can bridge the gap."", ""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is sticking to his budget but is showing willingness to compromise.  He's moving closer to Alice's price, but still offering a significant discount. This keeps the negotiation moving forward."
