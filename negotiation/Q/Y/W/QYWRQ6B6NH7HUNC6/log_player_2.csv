**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer of $12,500 is better than John's price of $15,000, Bob can still get a better deal by rejecting Alice's offer. This will force Alice to lower her price to be competitive with John, potentially leading to a price closer to Bob's $10,000 value."
