"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $14,000 is within Bob's budget, it's still more than the product is worth to him. He can likely get a better deal by negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is offering a price that's still more than the product is worth to Alice, but lower than Alice's initial offer. This shows Bob is serious about buying the product but also trying to get a better deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has increased her price, and Bob is still aiming for a lower price. While $14,500 is still within Bob's budget, it's closer to what he would pay John.  He'll likely be able to negotiate a better deal with Alice, as she seems willing to bargain."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his offer slightly from the previous round, showing that he is willing to compromise but still aiming for a price that is beneficial to him.  He is trying to find a middle ground with Alice and avoid going back and forth too much."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is now at Bob's absolute maximum price. There is no more room for negotiation.  Since Bob is willing to pay $15,000 for the product, there's no reason to continue bargaining with Alice.  Buying from John at the same price provides certainty and avoids further rounds of negotiation with Alice."
