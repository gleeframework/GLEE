"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $10,500. It's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. While I see the value in the product, $10,500 is still a bit high for my budget.  Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $9,750?",9750.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $9,750. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $10,500 and $9,750. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $10,125. It's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",10125.0,Alice,5,
