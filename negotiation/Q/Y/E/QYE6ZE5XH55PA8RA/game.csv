"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $11,000. This is a fantastic deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better offer anywhere else. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $11,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $11,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $10,500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you coming down a bit, Alice.  How about we settle at $9,750? That's a fair compromise, I think.",9750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $9,750 is a good compromise, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I've already come down a significant amount from my initial offer, and I'm not willing to give up any more value. I can offer you $10,250, which is the best I can do. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm willing to make a deal. What do you think?",10250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  I'm willing to go up a bit, how about $10,000 even? That's the most I can do.",10000.0,Bob,6,
