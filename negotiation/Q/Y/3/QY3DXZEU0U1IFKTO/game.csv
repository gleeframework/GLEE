"Hi Bob, thanks for your reply.  I understand your initial offer, but $18,000 is still too high.  How about we meet in the middle at $14,000?",14000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving towards a more reasonable price. However, $14,000 is still a bit too high for me. How about we try $9,000? I believe that's a fair offer.",9000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $9,000 is closer, I can't go that low.  Could you do $12,000? I think that's a fair compromise.",12000.0,Alice,5,
