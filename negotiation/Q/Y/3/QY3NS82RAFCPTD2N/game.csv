"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,800,000 is significantly above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product, which is my maximum. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but the product's value is truly significant. Let's meet in the middle - how about $1,500,000?",1500000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,500,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm prepared to pay $1,300,000.  This is a fair price considering the value I place on the product.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
