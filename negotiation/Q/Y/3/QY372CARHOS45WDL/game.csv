"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a bit high for me.  Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $16,000, which is still a great deal for you considering the value of this product. Let's try to find a middle ground.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand it's a good product but $16,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $13,000?",13000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $13,000 is still below my minimum price. Let's try $14,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product and the potential benefits it offers you. What do you say?",14000.0,Alice,5,
