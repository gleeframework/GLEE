"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really love! I'm asking for $175 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price above my minimum ($150) but below what I believe the product is worth. This leaves room for negotiation and helps me secure a better price.
* **Friendly approach:**  Starting with a friendly message can help build rapport and make Bob more inclined to negotiate. 
* **Leaving room for counteroffer:** This price allows for multiple rounds of counteroffers while still securing a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering me the product. I appreciate the recommendation. However, I believe we can come to a more reasonable price. How about $120 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $120 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  
* **More negotiation potential:**  I believe I can still get a higher price from Bob through further negotiation. 
* **Holding out for a better deal:**  While John is a safe option, I'm aiming for a higher profit, so I'll continue negotiating with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $120 is simply too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $140?  I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 140}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a price that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer. This shows willingness to negotiate while still maintaining a profit margin.
* **Emphasize Value:** I remind Bob of the product's value to encourage him to consider a higher price.
* **Direct Counteroffer:**  I'm directly proposing a new price to avoid further back-and-forth and move towards a decision."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I think $130 would be a fair price for the product considering its value. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:** While $130 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my target price and doesn't represent a significant profit.
* **Room for improvement:** I believe there's still room for negotiation to get closer to my desired price.
* **Focusing on a higher profit:**  While John's offer is a safe option, I want to maximize my earnings.

**Next Step:** I will counter with a price slightly lower than my previous offer, but still above $130.  I'll continue to negotiate in hopes of securing a more profitable deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your flexibility and understanding. $130 is getting closer, but I'm still hoping to get a little more for this product. How about $135?  This would still be a great deal for you, and it would allow me to make a fair profit."", ""product_price"": 135}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Concession:**  I'm making a small concession by lowering my price slightly from the previous round. This shows a willingness to compromise.
* **Focus on Value:** I reiterate the value of the product for Bob to encourage him to consider a slightly higher price.
* **Maintain Profit:** $135 is still a good profit margin for me and allows for the possibility of a higher offer in future rounds.

**Strategy:** I'm aiming to create a sense of urgency by showing willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a profitable deal. I believe with a few more rounds, I can convince Bob to accept a price closer to my target."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I've considered your last offer and am willing to go up to $132 for the product. I hope this helps us reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $132. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $132
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below target:**  While $132 is only $3 away from my desired price, I'm not yet willing to settle for a lower profit margin.
* **Limited rounds remaining:** With only 4 rounds left, I want to avoid selling for too low a price and risk regretting my decision.
* **Potential for better offer:** I believe there's still potential for Bob to increase his offer, especially as we're nearing the end of the negotiation.

**Next Step:**  I will counter with a price slightly lower than my previous offer, but still above $132.  I'll continue to be firm, but also demonstrate a willingness to negotiate in hopes of getting closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate.  $132 is a good offer, but I'm still hoping to get a little closer to my asking price.  How about $134? This would be a fair compromise for both of us, and it would allow me to make a decent profit."", ""product_price"": 134}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Concession:**  I'm making another small concession by lowering my price slightly, but I'm still aiming for a profit above my minimum of $150.
* **Emphasize Compromise:**  I emphasize that this price is a ""fair compromise,"" making it seem like a win-win situation for both of us.
* **Limited Rounds:** With only three rounds remaining, I'm trying to push for a deal that's close to my target price.

**Strategy:**  I'm still optimistic that I can get Bob to increase his offer, but I'm also prepared to accept $134 if it's the best deal I can get before I need to consider John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I've reviewed your latest offer and am willing to pay $133 for the product. I believe this is a fair price that respects both our positions in the negotiation. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $133. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $133
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Limited Rounds:**  With only two rounds left, the risk of not securing a deal with Bob increases.
* **Close to Target:**  $133 is only $2 away from my target price, and it's likely that Bob won't increase his offer further.
* **Profitable Deal:**  Although it's not ideal, $133 still represents a profit for me.  

**Strategy:**  While I'd prefer a higher price, the risk of losing out on any deal with Bob is too high. Accepting his offer ensures a profit, and with only one round left, it's unlikely that I can get a better deal from Bob."
