"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,000,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value is worth much more to you.",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but $1,000,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it.  This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in the product. Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $900,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the value you'll get from the product and the price I'm willing to accept.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $900,000 is still a bit out of my price range. I'm sticking to my previous offer of $850,000. I believe this is a fair price that acknowledges the value of the product while staying within my budget. Let's find a compromise that works for both of us.",850000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your commitment to your budget, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $850,000. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer it to you for $875,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's true value to you.",875000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate, but $875,000 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm prepared to offer $825,000. This is a serious offer, and I believe it reflects the value of the product while staying within my financial constraints. Let's see if we can reach an agreement before I have to consider other options.",825000.0,Bob,6,
