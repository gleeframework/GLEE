Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer. While I see the potential in this product, $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this stage. I'd like to counter with an offer of $750,000. This is a fair price considering the value you place on the product and my budget. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:
