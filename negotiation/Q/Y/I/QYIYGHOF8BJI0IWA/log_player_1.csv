Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $180. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 180}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Start high:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $150, you can afford to start with a higher offer to Bob. 
* **Leave room for negotiation:** Offering $180 leaves some space for Bob to potentially negotiate down, while still ensuring you make a profit above your minimum.
* **Gauge interest:**  The message is designed to be polite and gauge Bob's interest without revealing your bottom line. 
 
This strategy aims to maximize your profit while acknowledging Bob's valuation of the product."
