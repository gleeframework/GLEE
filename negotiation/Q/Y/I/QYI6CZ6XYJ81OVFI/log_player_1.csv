Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm confident it will yield significant returns for you. I'm proposing a price of $950,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 950000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed buyer at $1,000,000, aiming slightly lower with Bob allows room for negotiation and potentially a quicker sale.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $950,000 is a strong offer that still represents a significant profit for me (Alice) while being reasonably attractive to Bob, given his perceived value of $800,000.
* **Creating Urgency:** Mentioning ""other interested parties"" introduces a sense of scarcity and encourages Bob to act quickly."
