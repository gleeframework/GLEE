"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $14,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider a price closer to $8,000.",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $14,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $11,000. This is the best price I can offer at this point.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  $11,000 is still a bit high for my budget.  Could you do $9,500? I think that would be a fair price.",9500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $11,000 is still a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,500. I'm willing to make another concession and offer the product to you for $10,500. This is the best price I can offer at this point.",10500.0,Alice,5,
