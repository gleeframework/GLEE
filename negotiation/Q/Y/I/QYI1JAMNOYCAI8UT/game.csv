"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I really appreciate it, but $10,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. What do you think?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to be flexible. However, $8,500 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,500. This is a fair price that allows us both to benefit from this transaction. What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm prepared to pay $9,000, which I think is a fair price for both of us. Let's make this deal happen.",9000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to come down to $9,250. This is a reasonable compromise, and I believe it reflects the true value of this product.  Let's close this deal.",9250.0,Alice,5,
