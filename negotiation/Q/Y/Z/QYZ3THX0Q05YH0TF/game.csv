"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a fair price considering its value, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset to your business. Let me know what you think!",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your time and consideration, Alice. However, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe that's a fair price for the product, considering its value to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $900,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and my initial offer.  Let's find a middle ground here.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $1,050,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
