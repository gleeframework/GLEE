"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. I'm trying to be a savvy buyer, and I think we can meet in the middle.",90.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your interest, Bob. I understand your position, and I appreciate your effort to find a mutually beneficial price. However, given the value of the product to you and its cost to produce, I cannot agree to $90. I propose $105 as it still allows for a reasonable profit while being fair. I look forward to your response.",105.0,Alice,3,

"I'm getting close to the price I'm willing to pay, but I still think $102.50 is a bit high. I'd be willing to meet you at $100, which is the lowest price I'm willing to consider.",100.0,Bob,4,
