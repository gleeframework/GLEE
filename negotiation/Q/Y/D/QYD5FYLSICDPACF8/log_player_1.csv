I think it's a great opportunity for you to get a unique item that can bring a lot of value to your life. As we're just starting the negotiation, I'd like to make an opening offer of $15,000.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $15,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to go as high as $9,500.  Let me know what you think.

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:
