"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a great opportunity for you to get a unique item that can bring a lot of value to your life. As we're just starting the negotiation, I'd like to make an opening offer of $15,000. This is a fair price considering the product's worth to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a great deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Alice's offer is far too high.  Bob should reject the offer and start the counter-offer process."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $15,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to go as high as $9,500.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer of $9,500. I appreciate your interest in the product, and I'm willing to consider a counteroffer. However, I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. Considering its value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. I'm proposing a price of $12,500. This is a reasonable compromise that I think we can both be happy with. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $12,500 is better than Alice's initial offer, it's still above Bob's budget. He should continue negotiating to try and get closer to his target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $12,500 is still a little out of my price range.  I'm really hoping to stay under $10,000.  Would you be willing to consider $10,500? It's a fair compromise that's closer to our ideal numbers."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to stay under $10,000, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I need to make sure I'm getting a decent profit for the product. Considering its value to you, I'm willing to make another counteroffer. I'm proposing a price of $11,000. This is a reasonable compromise that I think we can both be happy with. I'm getting closer to your target price, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's getting closer to his target price, he can likely get a better deal if he keeps negotiating.  He's still got plenty of rounds left."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down again, but $11,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm confident that we can reach an agreement that works for both of us.  How about we split the difference and settle on $10,750?  It's a fair compromise that gets us closer to a deal."", ""product_price"": 10750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a compromise, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go any higher than $11,000. I've already compromised a lot, and I need to make sure I'm getting a decent profit for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need you to understand that $11,000 is my final offer. If you're willing to meet me at that price, I'm willing to make a deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice is firm on her $11,000 price, and Bob has already made multiple counteroffers.  It's getting close to Bob's budget, but not quite there.  Since he has the option to buy from John for $8,000, he should go ahead and do that. This is the best outcome for Bob since it saves him the most money."
