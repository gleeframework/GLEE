{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product. I'm asking for $175 for it. It's a great deal, and you'll get a lot of use out of it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than what I'd be willing to accept, knowing Bob values it lower. I'm aiming for a win-win where I maximize my profit while still leaving room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I'm looking to stay within my budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $120? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While I'm looking to sell the product, $120 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150.  I'll counter with a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $120 is just too low for me.  How about we split the difference and I go down to $140?  It's still a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 140}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. I would like to counter with $130 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my original asking price, Bob's offer of $130 is acceptable. It's higher than my minimum price and brings us closer to an agreement.  I'm going to accept his offer."
