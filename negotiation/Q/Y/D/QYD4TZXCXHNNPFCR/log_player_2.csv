# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. It's a fantastic deal, and I believe it's worth every penny. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $950,000 is a decent deal, Bob can likely do better.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  However, $850,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $900,000, which is still a great deal for you considering the value of this product.  Let's meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000.

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible. While $900,000 is better than the previous offer, it's still higher than Bob's ideal price. He can likely negotiate further and get the price down closer to his target of $850,000."
