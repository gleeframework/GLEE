Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm asking for $14,000.  I think it's a fair price considering what you'll gain from it."", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's $15,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $14,000 leaves some space for Bob to potentially negotiate down slightly, while still ensuring a significant profit for you.
* **Highlight Value:** The message emphasizes the value proposition to make the price more palatable. 
* **Time Pressure:** Mentioning a public listing subtly introduces a sense of urgency, potentially encouraging Bob to act quickly.

**Why not ask for the full $15,000?**

While tempting, it's generally not the best negotiation tactic. People like to feel like they got a deal. Asking for slightly less makes Bob more likely to accept and feel good about the transaction."
