Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $900,000. This is a good starting point because it leaves room for negotiation, but still represents a good profit for me.  I'm confident Bob will counteroffer, allowing us to find a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my target, it's still below what I'm willing to accept. I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price through further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 875000}
```

I'm going to counter with $875,000. This is a compromise, showing Bob I'm willing to negotiate, but it also keeps me closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $860,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $860,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While it's still below my ideal price, it's a good compromise, and it saves me the time and effort of further negotiation.  Selling to John would result in a lower profit, so accepting Bob's offer is the best option in this situation."
