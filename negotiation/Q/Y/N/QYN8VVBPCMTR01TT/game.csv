"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique features, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,000,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and potential.",2000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, but I'm not willing to pay $2,000,000. Considering the product's worth to you is $1,500,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm proposing a counteroffer of $1,250,000. I believe this is a fair price for both of us, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",1250000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you taking the time to consider my offer and for proposing a counteroffer. While I understand your perspective, the product's value is truly significant, and $1,250,000 falls short of what I believe is fair. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,800,000.  I'm confident this price reflects the value you'll gain from this product.",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but this time, I'm proposing a counteroffer of $1,700,000. I believe this is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1700000.0,Bob,4,
