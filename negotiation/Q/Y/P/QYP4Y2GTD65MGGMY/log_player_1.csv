"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,300,000. This is a great deal, and I believe it's fair considering the value it holds for you.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I can get from the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is lower than my minimum, I'm not ready to sell to John yet. I'm hoping to get closer to my desired price through further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,100,000 is significantly below my minimum asking price. I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000, which still reflects the product's value. Let's find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,250,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,200,000. Can we compromise at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is exactly my minimum acceptable price.  While I'd prefer more, it's a good deal and avoids the risk of further negotiation. It's also the same price John is offering, so there's no advantage to selling to John at this point."
