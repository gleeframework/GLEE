"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am delighted to present you with an extraordinary opportunity to acquire a unique product that holds immense value to both of us. Considering its significance and the benefits it would bring to you, I propose a purchase price of $950,000. This offer reflects a strategic midpoint between its intrinsic worth to me and its perceived value to you. I believe this price presents an excellent opportunity for both parties to achieve a fair transaction. Please let me know if you require any additional information or if you wish to discuss this further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Here's the reasoning:

* **Alice's offer is better than buying from John.**  You'd pay $950,000 from Alice, saving $250,000 compared to John's price. 
* **Alice's offer is still within your budget.** You're willing to spend up to $1,200,000, so $950,000 is acceptable."
