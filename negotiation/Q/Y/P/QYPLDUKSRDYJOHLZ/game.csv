"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this fantastic product. Given its unique value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000.  I believe this represents a fair starting point for negotiation.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product has value, I'm looking to spend significantly less. How about $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counter-offer. I understand your perspective, however,  $600,000 is significantly below its true worth.  I could consider letting it go for $950,000. This is a very competitive offer, reflecting the value this product brings.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $950,000 is still a bit too high for my budget.  Could we meet in the middle somewhere around $725,000?",725000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm seeing a gap in our valuations here. While I want to reach a deal, I also need to be fair to the product's value. I can come down slightly to $875,000.  This is my final offer, and I believe it's a very reasonable compromise.",875000.0,Alice,5,
