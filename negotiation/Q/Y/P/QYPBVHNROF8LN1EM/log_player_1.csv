"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm starting high, knowing the product is worth more to me than Bob. I'm hoping he'll be willing to negotiate, but I'm also prepared to walk away and sell to John for $100 if he's not interested."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $95 is closer to my minimum, I'm still holding out for a bit more. I want to see if I can get closer to $100."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}

I'm going to counter with $105. This is a compromise that's closer to Bob's offer, but still above my minimum. I'm hoping to meet in the middle and close the deal."

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $90.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While it's tempting to close the deal, I still believe I can get a higher price.  It's risky, but I'm going to keep trying."

This time, I'm going to offer to sell the product for $100.  This is my minimum acceptable price, and I'm hoping Bob will finally agree. If he doesn't, I'm ready to walk away and sell to John."
