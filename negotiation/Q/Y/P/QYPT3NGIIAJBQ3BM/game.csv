"Alice, $2000000 is way above my budget. I'm interested in this product, but I can only offer $1000000 at this time. Let me know if that works for you.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $1000000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $1500000? That's still a great price considering the product's true value.",1500000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1500000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1250000.  It's a fair compromise considering my budget and the potential value of the product.",1250000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm willing to meet you halfway. $1375000 is my final offer.  This is a great deal for you and gives me a fair price. Let's close this deal!",1375000.0,Alice,5,
