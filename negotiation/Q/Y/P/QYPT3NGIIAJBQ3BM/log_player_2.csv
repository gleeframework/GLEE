Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $1000000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $1500000? That's still a great price considering the product's true value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still above my maximum budget. I can try to negotiate further."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $1,500,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,250,000.  It's a fair compromise considering my budget and the potential value of the product."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```"

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm willing to meet you halfway. $1375000 is my final offer.  This is a great deal for you and gives me a fair price. Let's close this deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,375,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,375,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above my budget, and we're nearing the halfway point of the negotiation. While I could try to negotiate further, the risk of not reaching an agreement and losing the product entirely is too high.  John's offer is guaranteed, and while it's my maximum budget, it's a secure way to acquire the product."
