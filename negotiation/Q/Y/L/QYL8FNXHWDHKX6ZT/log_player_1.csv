Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it's worth $115. Would you be interested in buying it?"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 
 
This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** $115 is higher than your minimum acceptable price of $100. 
* **It's below Bob's value:**  $115 is lower than what the product is worth to Bob ($120), giving him room to negotiate.
* **It leaves room for counteroffers:**  You can adjust your price based on Bob's response.

By setting the price a little lower than what you think the product is worth, you're showing that you're open to negotiation while still aiming for a good profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $115 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $105? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is above your minimum, you can still potentially get a better price.  Rejecting his offer allows you to make a counteroffer and try to close the gap closer to your initial asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $105 is a bit too low for me.  How about $110?  It's a fair compromise that still gives us both a good deal."", ""product_price"": 110} 
```"
