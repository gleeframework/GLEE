"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $15,000 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  It's the best I can do right now.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $8,500 is significantly below its value.  I could consider letting it go for $13,000.  This is a very fair offer.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $13,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $10,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to stay within my budget.",10000.0,Bob,4,
