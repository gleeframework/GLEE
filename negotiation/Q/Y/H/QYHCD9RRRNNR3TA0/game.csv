"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $100 is significantly below my minimum.  How about we meet in the middle at $110? This is a fair price considering the value of the product.",110.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. I would like to counter with $105 for the product.",105.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm happy to see we're getting closer to an agreement. I'm still not comfortable going below $110, as that's what I believe this product is truly worth. Let's split the difference and finalize the deal at $107.50.  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",107.5,Alice,5,
