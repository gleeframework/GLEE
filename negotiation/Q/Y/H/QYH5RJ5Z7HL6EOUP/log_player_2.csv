"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1100000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value it holds for you.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above your maximum value. There's room for negotiation. You can counteroffer with a lower price and potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm aiming to spend closer to $1 million. I'd be willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm not quite ready to go that low. How about we meet in the middle at $1075000?  This would still be a great deal for you and a good price for me. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is closer to your ideal price and still within your budget.  While you could try to negotiate further, the risk of losing the deal with Alice and having to buy from John at a higher price is higher than the potential savings of a few thousand dollars."
