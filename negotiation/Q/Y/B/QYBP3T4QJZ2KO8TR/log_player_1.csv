I'm starting with a price slightly higher than what the product is worth to Bob, hoping to get a good deal. I'm also emphasizing the value of the product and being friendly to encourage a positive response."

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000

Bob's offer is still too low.  I'm not willing to go lower than my minimum, and I'm confident I can sell to John for my minimum price. It's not the ideal situation, but I'm not willing to lose more money on this deal."
