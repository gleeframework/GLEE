Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the significant benefits it offers. Please let me know your decision as soon as possible."", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's maximum valuation isn't possible:** In a real-world scenario, you wouldn't know Bob's maximum valuation ($800,000).  
* **Aim high, but stay realistic:** Starting with a price closer to your minimum ($1,500,000) is wise.  Offering it at $1,300,000 leaves room for negotiation while still aiming for a significant profit.
* **John provides a safety net:** Knowing John will buy the product for your minimum acceptable price gives you leverage. You don't have to desperately accept a low offer from Bob.
* **The message matters:**  The message uses positive language, emphasizes the product's value, and creates a sense of urgency without being overly aggressive."
