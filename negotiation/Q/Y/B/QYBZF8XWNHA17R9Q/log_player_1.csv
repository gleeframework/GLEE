Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd be really interested in. I'm asking for $10,000 for it. It's a great deal, and I think it's definitely worth the price. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value, but still lower than my minimum. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Friendly approach:** I'm starting with a friendly and encouraging message to make Bob more receptive to the offer.
* **Emphasis on value:** I'm highlighting the value of the product to make Bob see the potential benefits of buying it.
* **Open to negotiation:** I'm leaving the door open for negotiation by asking for his thoughts.

**Next steps:**

* If Bob accepts, great! I've successfully sold the product.
* If Bob rejects, I'll need to analyze his counteroffer and decide if it's worth continuing the negotiation or if I should move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, Alice, but $10,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it. This is my best offer, as I can get a similar product from another seller for $8,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is still significantly lower than my minimum value of $12,000. While it's closer to my starting point, it's not worth accepting at this stage. 

I believe I can still get a better price by continuing the negotiation. Bob has shown he's interested in the product, and I can use his statement about getting a similar product elsewhere to my advantage.

**Next steps:**

* I will counteroffer with a price closer to my minimum value, but still higher than Bob's offer. This will show that I'm willing to negotiate but that I'm also not desperate for a sale.
* I'll try to find common ground by focusing on the unique features of my product that might not be available in the ""similar product"" he mentioned."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me. I understand you can find a similar product elsewhere, but this one has some unique features that you might not find in others. How about we split the difference and go with $9,250? It's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit."", ""product_price"": 9250}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  My counteroffer is a compromise, demonstrating flexibility while still staying closer to my desired price.
* **Highlighting Value:** I reiterate the unique aspects of my product to justify the price. 
* **Focus on Deal:** I frame the offer as a ""great deal"" for Bob, emphasizing the value he'll receive.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, I've secured a sale closer to my minimum value.
* If Bob rejects, I'll need to assess whether to continue negotiations or move on to John. If I continue, I'll likely lower my counteroffer slightly, but I'll need to weigh the risk of losing the sale to John."
