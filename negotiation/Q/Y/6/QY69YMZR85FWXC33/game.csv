"Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product! I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire this valuable item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $10,000. This is a competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere.",10000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you coming down from $12,000, but $10,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider something closer to $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $6,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you the product for $8,500. This is a fair price considering the value it brings, and I think it's a good middle ground for both of us.",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground, Alice. However, $8,500 is still a bit more than I was hoping to spend. Could you consider $7,000? I think that's a fair offer.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $7,000 is a good offer, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $8,500 and $7,000. I can offer you the product for $8,000. This is a fair price, and I think it's a good compromise for both of us.",8000.0,Alice,5,
