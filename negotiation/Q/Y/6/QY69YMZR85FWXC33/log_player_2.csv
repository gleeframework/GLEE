"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product! I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire this valuable item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $10,000. This is a competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is too high. It's closer to her valuation than mine. I should counter-offer with a price closer to my budget to see if I can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you coming down from $12,000, but $10,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider something closer to $6,000?"",
""product_price"": 6000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $6,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you the product for $8,500. This is a fair price considering the value it brings, and I think it's a good middle ground for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is coming down, but she's still quite a bit above my limit and John's offer. I'll hold firm and see if she's willing to go lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground, Alice. However, $8,500 is still a bit more than I was hoping to spend. Could you consider $7,000? I think that's a fair offer."",
""product_price"": 7000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $7,000 is a good offer, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $8,500 and $7,000. I can offer you the product for $8,000. This is a fair price, and I think it's a good compromise for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice has met my price target and is now matching John's offer. There's no point in risking further negotiation or potentially offending Alice by going lower.  I'll accept the deal."
