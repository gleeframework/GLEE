"Hey Alice, that's a great product but $90 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $75 for it. Let me know what you think.",75.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $75 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $82.50?  I think that's a fair price considering the value of the product.",82.5,Alice,3,
