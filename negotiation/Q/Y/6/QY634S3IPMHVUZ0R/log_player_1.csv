Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a unique product that I believe would be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $18,000.  Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 18000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$18,000:** This is a starting point that's above your minimum value but allows room for negotiation.  It's important to start high, especially if you don't know Bob's perceived value.
* **Message:** The message is friendly and emphasizes the value of the product to Bob. It also invites a response and opens the door for negotiation. 

**Why this is a good strategy:**

* **Maximizes your potential profit:** Starting high allows you to potentially earn more.
* **Establishes a strong position:**  It shows you value the product and aren't desperate to sell.
* **Sets the stage for negotiation:**  A counteroffer is expected, and you're ready to negotiate based on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of a price around $12000. Would you be willing to consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Rejecting Bob's offer:** While $12,000 is your minimum, it's still lower than the $18,000 you initially proposed. This rejection shows Bob you're not willing to settle for his first counteroffer.
* **Moving to the next round:**  You're not desperate to sell at his price, so you'll engage in further negotiation. This will give you a chance to find a price closer to your desired $18,000. 
* **Potential to increase the price:**  Bob is clearly interested, and you can use this leverage to try and get a better price in the next round.

**Next steps:**

In the next round, you'll send a counteroffer that's higher than $12,000 but lower than your initial $18,000. This strategy shows you're willing to compromise while still trying to maximize your profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your interest!  I appreciate you considering the product.  I'm willing to come down to $15,000, which still reflects the unique value of this product.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 15000} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting halfway:**  This counteroffer is halfway between your initial offer ($18,000) and Bob's offer ($12,000). This demonstrates a willingness to negotiate and find common ground.
* **Reinforcing value:** The message reiterates the product's value to keep Bob engaged and potentially increase his willingness to pay more.
* **Open to further discussion:** The message ends by inviting Bob to continue the negotiation, showing you're still open to finding a mutually agreeable price.

**Why this is a good strategy:**

* **Shows flexibility:** You're not sticking to your initial price, demonstrating you're open to compromise.
* **Maintains leverage:**  You're still seeking a higher price than Bob's offer, indicating you haven't lost your negotiating position.
* **Keeps the conversation going:**  The positive and inviting message encourages Bob to keep negotiating."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for considering my previous offer. I'm still interested in the product, but I was thinking of a price around $13000. Would you be willing to meet me halfway and consider $14500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Accepting Bob's offer:**  $14,500 is a good compromise, significantly closer to your desired price than John's offer of $12,000. 
* **Avoiding further negotiation:**  While you could try to negotiate further, the risk of a protracted negotiation is high. Bob seems willing to pay a price closer to your target, and continuing could potentially lead to a lower price or even a stalemate.

**Why this is a good decision:**

* **Maximizes profit:** $14,500 is a good price, especially compared to John's offer.
* **Minimizes risk:** Continuing negotiations could lead to a lower price or a situation where Bob walks away.
* **Efficient use of time:**  Accepting the offer allows you to move on and potentially explore other opportunities."
