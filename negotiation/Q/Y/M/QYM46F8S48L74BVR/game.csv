"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of your product, but I'm currently working within a budget of $800,000. Would it be possible for us to negotiate a price closer to that amount?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but it's significantly lower than what I'm looking for. Given your expressed budget constraint, I'm willing to drop my price to $1,200,000. This still provides a substantial margin for you to profit from the product, and it's a more reasonable starting point for us.",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. While I appreciate the reduction, I'm still working within a tight budget. I would like to propose a price of $950,000 for your product. I believe this offers a fair compromise between our interests.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your financial constraints, but I'm still aiming for a price closer to $1,200,000. How about we split the difference?  I'm willing to offer the product for $1,075,000. This allows me to still achieve a reasonable profit, and gives you a good deal within your budget.",1075000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I value our ongoing negotiation, but I need to be closer to $1,200,000 to make this worthwhile.  I'm willing to come down to $1,125,000. This is my final offer, as I'm approaching my deadline for selling the product. Let me know if you're able to accept.",1125000.0,Alice,7,

"Bob, we're getting very close.  I'm willing to lower my price one last time to $1,100,000. This is a fair compromise that allows both of us to benefit from the transaction.  If you're unable to accept, I'll have to move forward with my alternative offer, which is unfortunately less favorable for you.  Let me know your decision.",1100000.0,Alice,9,
