"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe would be incredibly valuable to you. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,350,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course.",1350000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,350,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'd be willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counter-offer, but $1,100,000 is a significant deviation from my initial asking price.  This product has tremendous value, and I believe a fairer price would be $1,275,000. This still offers you a substantial return on your investment.",1275000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective on the product's value, but $1,275,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,200,000, which I believe is a fair price for both of us.  Let's meet in the middle.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
