"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. What do you think?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I appreciate your offer,  $9,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to be compensated fairly for this product. How about we split the difference and go with $10,500? This price still offers you a good deal compared to your initial assessment, and it's closer to what I need.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $10,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $10,250. This price still shows that I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my means. What do you think?",10250.0,Bob,4,
