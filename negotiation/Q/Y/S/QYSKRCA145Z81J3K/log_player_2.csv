"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which we believe would greatly benefit you. Considering its value and quality, we're extending this exclusive opportunity to you for $110. We hope you find it worth considering! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is still significantly higher than what John is offering.  It's worth seeing if we can negotiate a better price with Alice first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $110 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $80?"",
""product_price"": 80
}
``` 

This counteroffer is a significant decrease from Alice's offer, but it leaves room for negotiation and is still significantly below our alternative option of buying from John for $100."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your interest, Bob. After careful consideration, I'm glad to present you with an alternative offer at $95 for our product. This is a special deal considering its high value and benefits. I hope this aligns better with your budget. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is coming down, but $95 is still more than we need to pay. We're close enough to our target that it's worth another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me on the price, Alice.  $95 is closer, but I'm aiming for something around $85."",
""product_price"": 85
}
``` 

We're nudging closer to a price that works for us, while still leaving room for Alice to potentially meet us in the middle."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your position, Bob. Considering the value and quality of the product, I am willing to offer it to you for $90. This is the best offer I can make, taking into account the current market conditions and the value you place on the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice is unlikely to go much lower, and $90 is a reasonable price, saving us $10 compared to John's offer. It's time to accept and secure the deal."
