Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 15000}

I'm starting with a price that is higher than my minimum but still leaves room for negotiation. I believe this is a good starting point to gauge Bob's interest and potentially secure a higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is too low. I'm willing to negotiate, but $10,000 is significantly less than my minimum.  I will make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

I'm counter-offering with $13,000. This is still above my minimum but acknowledges Bob's willingness to negotiate. I believe this is a reasonable price that could potentially lead to a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is not willing to negotiate closer to my desired price.  I've already lowered my price once, and I'm not willing to go lower than my minimum. It's better to sell to John and get a guaranteed price of $12,000 than to continue negotiating with Bob and risk getting a lower price or no deal at all."
