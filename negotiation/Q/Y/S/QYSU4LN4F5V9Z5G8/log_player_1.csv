Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for sale at $115. I believe it offers excellent value at this price."", 
""product_price"": 115
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I begin by anchoring the negotiation close to Bob's perceived value ($120). This leaves room for potential negotiation while aiming for a price significantly higher than my minimum ($100) and John's offer.
* **Justification:** Providing a brief justification, even if general, can make the offer seem more reasonable and encourage Bob to engage.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  By starting at $115, I signal that I'm open to negotiation without immediately dropping to my lowest acceptable price. 

This strategy aims to maximize my profit while still being attractive enough for Bob to consider seriously."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer Alice, but that's a bit steep for me. Would you consider $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $90 is significantly below both my minimum acceptable price ($100) and his own perceived value of the product ($120). Accepting this offer would mean a significant loss for me. While selling to John is an option, I believe there's still room to negotiate a better price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand your perspective, Bob. However, $90 undervalues the product significantly. Could you consider meeting me halfway at $102.50?"",
""product_price"": 102.50
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  By suggesting we ""meet halfway,"" I'm demonstrating a willingness to negotiate and find a mutually beneficial price.
* **Strategic Counter:** I haven't simply moved closer to his offer; I've calculated a midpoint between his offer ($90) and my initial asking price ($115). This keeps the negotiation moving while still aiming for a higher price. 
* **Above Minimum:**  Importantly, this counteroffer still ensures I receive a price above my minimum acceptable amount ($100) and John's offer. 

This approach attempts to balance firmness on value with a willingness to negotiate a fair deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you trying to find a compromise, Alice. How about we settle at $95? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is moving closer to my minimum price, his offer of $95 is still below John's guaranteed offer of $100.  At this point, further negotiation with Bob risks:

* **Lost Time:**  Continuing to negotiate delays the sale and potentially misses out on other opportunities.
* **Price Concessions:**  Bob might only be willing to increase his offer in very small increments, making further negotiation less profitable. 

Selling to John ensures a guaranteed $100, avoids further haggling, and allows me to move on to other potential deals."
