Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your response. I appreciate your offer, but I still feel that $120 would be a fair price for the product. I am willing to stick with that offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:

Bob is not budging from his $120 offer. It's unlikely he'll go much higher and we risk getting stuck in a loop. It's better to take the guaranteed $150 from John."
