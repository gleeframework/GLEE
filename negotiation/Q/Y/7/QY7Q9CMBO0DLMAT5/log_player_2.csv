"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing product at a special price. It's a one-time opportunity, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to let it go for $1,200,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high for Bob.  He's aiming for a price closer to $800,000. It's better to reject and counter-offer to start negotiating a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the opportunity, $1,200,000 is still a bit higher than my budget. I'm very interested in the product, but I can only offer $900,000 at this time. Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial price but still leaves room for negotiation. It's a good starting point to see if Alice is willing to meet Bob halfway."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob. However, I've got to make a profit on this deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $1,100,000 for the product. Can you consider that? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still too high for Bob.  He's aiming for a price closer to $800,000 and wants to save as much money as possible. Rejecting this offer allows him to continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,100,000 is still outside my budget. I'm happy to meet you further in the middle, but I can only go as high as $950,000.  This would allow both of us to make a good deal."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is moving closer to Alice's offer but still maintains a gap. This shows a willingness to compromise while keeping his target price range in mind.  He's also trying to appeal to Alice by highlighting the benefits of the deal for both parties."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to think we're close, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can do $1,050,000, but that's as low as I can go. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can wrap up the deal here. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is coming down in price, $1,050,000 is still significantly above Bob's desired price point of $800,000. He is still very motivated to save as much money as possible, and there is a significant gap between the two parties. It's worth continuing to negotiate to try and bridge the difference."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, we're getting closer, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm confident we can reach an agreement if we compromise. I'm willing to go up to $975,000.  This would be a fair deal for both of us, and I'm confident we can close the deal quickly."", ""product_price"": 975000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is making another counteroffer, this time going up to $975,000.  This shows a willingness to move closer to Alice's position, but he's still holding firm to his target of staying below $1 million. He's also reinforcing the potential benefits of a deal at this price point."
