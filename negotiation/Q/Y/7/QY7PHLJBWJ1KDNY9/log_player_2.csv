"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for a special price of $130. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You can get the product for less than $130 from Alice, so rejecting the offer and counter-offering is the best option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but $130 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now. How about we split the difference and go with $125?"", ""product_price"": 125}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $125. How about we meet in the middle and go with $132.50? It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really love the product! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $132.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $132.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Alice's offer is closer to your desired price, it's still above your target of $120. There's still room for negotiation, so rejecting and counter-offering again is the best option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down, Alice. I'm still a bit hesitant at $132.50. How about we settle at $128? It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can both be happy with that price."", ""product_price"": 128}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $128. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. How about we meet at $131? It's still a good deal for both of us, and I think you'll really love the product! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $131. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $131
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice's offer of $131 is close to your target of $120.  You can accept her offer and still save $19 compared to buying from John. Continuing to negotiate might lead to further concessions, but it's likely Alice won't go much lower than $130. It's better to secure the deal at a price you're comfortable with."
