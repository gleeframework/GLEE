Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $140. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides."",
""product_price"": 140
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  I want to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($120) as possible while still ensuring I make a profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $140 leaves some room for Bob to counter-offer, potentially reaching a price that's still profitable for me (above $150).
* **Time Value:** While I have a guaranteed buyer at $150, selling to Bob quickly might be preferable. A slightly lower price could lead to a faster sale."
