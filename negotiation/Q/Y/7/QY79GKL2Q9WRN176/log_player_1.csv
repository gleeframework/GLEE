{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a valuable asset, and I believe this price reflects its worth.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. I'm aiming for a price close to the value Bob sees, but leaving room for negotiation. It also allows me to gauge his interest and potentially increase the price further in subsequent rounds if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. I think it's a great asset, but I'm trying to be responsible with my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is higher than what John is willing to pay, it's still significantly lower than the value I place on the product ($1,000,000). I'm not willing to accept a price that undervalues my asset. I will counteroffer Bob with a slightly lower price, aiming to find a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,075,000.  This price reflects a fair compromise, considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1075000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000, and I think that's a fair price considering the value of the product. Can we meet in the middle at $1,062,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,062,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,062,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,062,500 is a good compromise. While it's still lower than my initial asking price, it's higher than John's offer and closer to my minimum acceptable value. Accepting this offer ensures a sale and allows me to make a profit."
