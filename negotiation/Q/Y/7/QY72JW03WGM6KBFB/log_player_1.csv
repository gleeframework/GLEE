"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a great product for you that I think you'll love. I'm offering it to you for $100.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. $100 is a bit more than I'm looking to spend.  I'm willing to pay $85 for the product. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $85 is better than selling to John, I believe I can get a better price from Bob if I continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a little above that price point.  How about we meet in the middle at $92.50?  I'm confident you'll find this product worth the price."", ""product_price"": 92.5}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $92.50 is still a bit too much for me. Let's split the difference - how about $90?  That's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  $90 is a good price, and it's getting close to my desired price point.  I don't want to risk losing the deal by pushing too hard, and there's always a chance Bob will walk away."
