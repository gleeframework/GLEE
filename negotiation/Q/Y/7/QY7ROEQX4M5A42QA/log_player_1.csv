Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm offering Bob a price of $1,500,000. This is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than my guaranteed minimum:** I know I can get $1,000,000 from John, so this price gives me room to negotiate.
* **It leaves room for a compromise:**  I can potentially lower the price if Bob seems interested but hesitant.
* **It reflects the potential value of the product:**  If the product is truly worth more to Bob, he might be willing to pay a premium.

By offering a higher price, I'm aiming to maximize my potential earnings. If Bob rejects the offer, I'll still be able to sell the product to John for $1,000,000."
