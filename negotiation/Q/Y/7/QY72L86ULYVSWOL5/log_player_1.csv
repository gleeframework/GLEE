Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 140}
``` 

I'm starting with a high price, close to Bob's perceived value, but leaving some room for negotiation. This should encourage Bob to make a counteroffer, hopefully getting us closer to a mutually beneficial deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $110 is better than selling to John, I believe I can get closer to my desired price. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 125}
``` 

I'm offering $125, which is still a good deal for Bob (higher than his offer) but closer to my ideal price. This should encourage him to accept or come up with a counteroffer closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $105 is better than selling to John, it's still not a satisfying price for me. I'll make one last counteroffer to see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 115} 
```

I'm offering $115, which is a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's last offer. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping that Bob will accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob has rejected my final offer, and there's no more room for negotiation.  Since John is willing to pay $100, I'll sell the product to him. It's not ideal, but it's better than continuing to negotiate with Bob and risk getting nothing."
