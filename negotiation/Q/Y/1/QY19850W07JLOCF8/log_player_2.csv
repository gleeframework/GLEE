"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $950000. This is a competitive price considering the product's value to you, and I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to come out ahead. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob can do better than $950,000.  Since the product is worth $800,000 to Alice, there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, $950,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it, which is still a fair price considering its value to me and your asking price.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that the product's value to you justifies a higher price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $875000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's worth, and I believe it's a good opportunity for both of us to come out ahead. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $875,000 is a good deal for Bob. It's significantly lower than John's price of $1,000,000 and still allows Bob to make a profit considering the product's value to him.  There's a chance that Bob could negotiate further and get an even lower price, but the risk of Alice rejecting his counteroffer and him having to buy from John at a higher price outweighs the potential savings.  Accepting the offer guarantees a good price and avoids the risk of further negotiation."
