I'm starting with a price that's higher than my minimum, hoping to maximize my profit. I'll see if Bob is willing to pay it. If not, we'll start negotiating."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json

$100 is too low for me. I'm willing to negotiate, but I won't sell it for that price. I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm lowering my price a bit, but still holding out for a profit. Hopefully, Bob will be willing to pay this amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110

```

While I'd prefer a higher price, $110 is better than my minimum of $120 and closer to my initial offer.  I'll take it and avoid further negotiation."
