"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. It's worth a great deal to you, and I believe we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. My starting offer is $1,100,000.  Let's discuss! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject the offer.  He can likely get a better price from Alice.  $1,100,000 is still too high given his maximum budget of $1,200,000, and the product is worth $1,000,000 to Alice.  There's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000.  This price is fair for both of us, allowing you a decent profit while staying within my budget. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm not quite ready to let go of the product for that price. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but $1,075,000 is my absolute bottom line. It allows me to recover a significant portion of the value and still makes this a good deal for you.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  At $1,075,000, he's still saving $125,000 compared to buying from John. While he could try to negotiate further, there's a risk Alice will walk away and he'll be forced to pay John's higher price. This offer gives him a good deal without unnecessary risk."
