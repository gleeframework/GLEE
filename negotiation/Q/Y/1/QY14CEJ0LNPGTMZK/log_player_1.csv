Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a potential offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** $800,000 (your backup offer from John)
* **Bob's Value:** $1,200,000
* **Potential Profit for Bob:** $400,000 ($1,200,000 - $800,000)

**Strategy**

You want to aim for a price that gives Bob a good deal (so he's incentivized to accept) while maximizing your profit.  Offering a price slightly below Bob's maximum value ensures you get the most out of the deal.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product. I know it's something that could be incredibly valuable to you, and I've tailored my offer with that in mind. I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the significant benefit you'll gain."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **The Message:** It emphasizes value to Bob, suggesting a carefully considered offer.
* **The Price:** $1,150,000 leaves Bob with a $50,000 profit margin. This is a significant saving for him while netting you $350,000 more than your fallback option.

**Important Note:**  Negotiation is dynamic. Bob might counter-offer. Be prepared to adjust within your acceptable range ($800,000 minimum)."
