"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but $9,000 is my maximum budget. I'd be willing to pay $8,500 for it. I think it's a fair price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  $8,500 is too low for me, and I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price. I have time, and I can still sell to John if the negotiation with Bob falls through."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go that low.  I'm willing to come down to $9,500. That's still a great deal for you, and it gives me some wiggle room to meet your budget. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still really interested in the product, but $8,000 is my final offer. I think it's a fair price considering its value to me, and I'm willing to walk away if you can't meet me at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. $8,000 is still too far below my minimum price, and I'm willing to take the risk of continuing to negotiate. I'm confident that I can get a better price, and I don't want to settle for less than what I believe the product is worth."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're firm on your price, but I can't go below $9,000. This is my final offer. It's a fair price, and I believe it's still a great deal for you considering the value of the product. I'm confident you'll see the benefit of this deal."", ""product_price"": 9000}

Round 6
Bob's offer:

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

This is a tough situation. Bob seems very firm on his price, and I'm running out of rounds. While I'd like to get closer to my initial asking price, I don't want to risk losing the deal altogether.  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum price, so I'm going to take that option."
