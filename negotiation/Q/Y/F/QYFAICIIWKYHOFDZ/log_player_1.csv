"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'll find it very valuable. I'm offering it to you for $18,000. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 18000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum acceptable value of $15,000, giving me room to negotiate. 
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a friendly and enthusiastic message to build rapport and hopefully encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation. 
* **Focus on Value:** I'm highlighting the value of the product to Bob, hoping he'll see its worth.

**Strategy:**  

My goal is to secure the best possible price while also keeping the negotiation open. By starting high, I create space to potentially meet in the middle and still get a good deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. While I'm open to negotiation, I won't accept such a low price at this stage. I'll try to counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $12,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $16,000.  This price still reflects the value I know you'll get from it.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 16000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter with a Compromise:** I'm offering a price that's halfway between my initial offer and Bob's offer, showing a willingness to compromise.
* **Maintain Value Emphasis:** I'm still highlighting the value the product brings to Bob, reminding him of its worth.
* **Positive but Firm Tone:**  I'm staying positive and open to negotiation, but also conveying that I'm not willing to go much lower.

**Strategy:**

I want to see if Bob is willing to meet me halfway. This counteroffer shows flexibility while still protecting my minimum acceptable price point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $16,000, but I'm still a bit hesitant. How about we meet in the middle at $14,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $14,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. While it's closer, I'm not willing to accept it just yet. I'd rather try to negotiate further and see if we can reach a price closer to my target.

**Strategy:**

I'll continue to negotiate with Bob, hoping to secure a higher price. I'm still early in the process, and I have a backup option in John.  There's no rush to accept a deal that's not good for me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position. I'm willing to go a bit lower to $15,000, which is my absolute minimum. This price reflects the true value of the product, and I believe it's a fair deal for both of us.  Let's get this done!"", ""product_price"": 15000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Final Offer:** This is my final offer, as it represents my minimum acceptable price.
* **Emphasis on Value:** I'm once again reminding Bob of the value the product brings.
* **Urgency:** I'm adding a sense of urgency by saying ""let's get this done,"" hoping to encourage Bob to accept.

**Strategy:**

I've reached my limit, and I'm putting the ball in Bob's court. If he rejects this offer, I'll move on to John, who is guaranteed to buy the product for my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit short of my budget. Would you be willing to come down to $13,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $13,500 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  We've been going back and forth for several rounds, and it's clear that we're not going to find a price that works for both of us. It's time to move on. John is a guaranteed sale at my minimum price, and I'm not going to waste any more time trying to convince Bob to pay more."
