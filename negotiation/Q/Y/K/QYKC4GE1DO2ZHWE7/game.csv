"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1200000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay at this moment. I'm happy to purchase the product from you, but I'd need to see a lower price point.  My initial counteroffer is $850000.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $850000 is a bit too low for me.  Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $1000000. This price still allows me to make a fair profit, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us.  What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  While $1000000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay, I'm willing to meet you halfway.  My new counteroffer is $900000.  I believe this price is fair for both of us, and I'm hopeful we can close the deal.",900000.0,Bob,4,
