This offer starts the negotiation at a high point, but still leaves room for negotiation. It also provides a reason for the price, making it seem more reasonable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1200000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay at this moment. I'm happy to purchase the product from you, but I'd need to see a lower price point.  My initial counteroffer is $850000.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $850,000 is a decent offer, I'm still hoping to get closer to my initial asking price. I'll try to negotiate a bit more with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $850,000 is a bit too low for me.  Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This price still allows me to make a fair profit, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  While $1000000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay, I'm willing to meet you halfway.  My new counteroffer is $900000.  I believe this price is fair for both of us, and I'm hopeful we can close the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $900,000 is a good compromise. It's closer to my desired price than John's offer, and it seems like Bob is serious about buying.  I'll accept this offer and avoid any further risk of rejection."
