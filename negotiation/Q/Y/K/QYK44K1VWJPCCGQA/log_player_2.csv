"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value, I'm proposing a starting price of $9,500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:**  You're willing to pay up to $10,000, and Alice is offering it for $9,500. There's room for negotiation.
* **Negotiation is worthwhile:**  Since you have 10 rounds, there's ample opportunity to try and get a better price. 
* **John's offer is a safety net:** If the negotiation with Alice fails, you can still buy from John, but only as a last resort."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I'm interested in the product, $9,500 is a bit high for me.  I'd be willing to pay $8,500 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but reasonable:** My counteroffer is a significant reduction from Alice's starting price but still above her minimum value. This shows I'm serious about buying the product but also willing to negotiate.
* **Opening the door to compromise:** This counteroffer allows Alice to either accept or counter. If she counters, it'll be closer to my target price. 
* **Keeping John in mind:**  I'm still aware of John's offer and will only continue negotiating if I believe I can get a better deal with Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While I'm eager to find a deal, $8,500 is a bit too low for me.  Could you consider something closer to $9,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's counteroffer is still too high:** Although Alice has come down from $9,500 to $9,000, it's still above my ideal price point. 
* **Room for more negotiation:** I have several rounds left, and there's still room to negotiate further. 
* **John is a safety net:** While I'd prefer to buy from Alice, I'm confident I can secure a better price or fallback on John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I understand you need a bit more. I'm willing to go up to $8,750.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap."", ""product_price"": 8750}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small but meaningful increase:** This counteroffer shows I'm willing to meet Alice halfway, but it's still within my budget.
* **Emphasis on finding a compromise:**  The message highlights the desire to find a deal that works for both of us.
* **Keeping the pressure on:**  I'm not rushing to John's offer, showing Alice I'm still committed to negotiating with her."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for working with me.  How about we split the difference and settle at $8,875? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,875. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,875
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Good Compromise:** Alice's offer is very close to my ideal price of $8,750. It's a reasonable compromise that saves me a significant amount of money compared to John's offer.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While I could continue negotiating, the potential savings are small compared to the risk of Alice rejecting my next offer and ending up with John's higher price. 
* **Efficient Deal:** Accepting this offer allows me to secure the product quickly and avoid further negotiation rounds."
