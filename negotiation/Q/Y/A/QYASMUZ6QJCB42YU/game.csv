"Alice, $1,000,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price, considering its value to me. Let's reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is still below what I'm aiming for. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need at least $950,000. This price is still a great deal for you, and it gives us both a good outcome. Let me know what you think. ",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your need to get a good price, but $950,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $900,000, which is a fair compromise considering our previous offers. Let's find common ground and finalize this deal.",900000.0,Bob,4,
