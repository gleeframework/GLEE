Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $8,000 is still a bit below my target price. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm offering the product to you for $8,500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I hope it's something you'd be interested in.

It's unlikely Alice will go below $8,500. It's better to secure the product from John at your target price of $8,000."
