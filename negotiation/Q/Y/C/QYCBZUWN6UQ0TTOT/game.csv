"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm offering the product to you for $10,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you.",10000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $10,000 is a little too high for my budget. Would you consider $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer of $7,000. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm still not willing to sell it for that price. Considering its value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $9,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you moving towards my direction, Alice.  How about we settle at $8,000? This would be a fair deal for both of us.",8000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $8,000 is still a bit below my target price. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm offering the product to you for $8,500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I hope it's something you'd be interested in.",8500.0,Alice,5,
