"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think the product is worth a bit more to me than $70. How about we compromise at $82? I'm willing to make a concession to get the deal done, but I need to make sure I get a fair price for the product.",82.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not comfortable going as low as $78. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to make sure I get a bit more value for the product. How about we try $81? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",81.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I understand that you're trying to get a fair price for the product, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I think $79 is the absolute maximum I can go. Would you be willing to accept that price?",79.0,Bob,6,
