Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm not sure I can meet your initial price of $1,300,000. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $900,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. This product has significant value that I'm confident you'll benefit from. How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000?"", ""product_price"": 1100000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're confident in the product's value, but I still think $1,100,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'd like to propose $950,000. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000

While Bob is moving closer to a reasonable offer, it's unlikely he'll reach $1,000,000. John represents a guaranteed sale at my minimum acceptable price. It makes the most sense to secure the deal with John."
