``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $175. This is a good starting point as it's higher than my minimum value, but still potentially attractive to Bob given his valuation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $160
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
Bob's offer of $160 is a good compromise.  It's above my minimum value and we're likely to reach an agreement sooner rather than later."
