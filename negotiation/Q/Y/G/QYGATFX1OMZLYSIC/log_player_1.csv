{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $13,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation by setting a price slightly above Bob's perceived value, leaving room for potential compromise. It also expresses confidence in the product's value, hoping to make Bob more likely to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer but $13000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay. I'm happy to pay $11500 for the product, as it's still a good deal for me. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $11,500 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum price of $12,000.  I will reject Bob's offer and attempt to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand your perspective, but $11,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $12,500, which I believe is a fair compromise considering the product's value. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 12500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $12500.  However,  I'm still looking to spend a bit less.  I'm willing to pay $12250.  Let's split the difference and make this happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $12,250 is very close to my minimum price of $12,000. I'm willing to accept this offer as it is a good deal for me, especially considering the possibility of continuing negotiations and potentially ending up with nothing if I reject."
