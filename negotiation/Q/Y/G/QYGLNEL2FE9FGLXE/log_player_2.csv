"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you might be interested in. It's something that's worth a lot to you, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $115.  Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Buying from Alice for $115 is cheaper than buying from John for $120.
* Even though the product is worth $100 to Alice, that information isn't relevant to your decision. You're focused on getting the best deal for yourself, and $115 is better than $120."
