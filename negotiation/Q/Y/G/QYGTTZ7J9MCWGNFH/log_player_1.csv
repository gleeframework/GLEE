Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you this fantastic product for $1,000,000. It's a significant investment, but I believe it holds incredible value for you.  Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial deal."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the value you're offering. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
While $900,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not happy with it. I'll try to counteroffer and see if we can get closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $900,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This reflects the significant value this product brings to you, and it's a price I believe is fair considering the potential gains you'll see."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, Alice, but $950,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $925,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value you're offering, and I'm willing to compromise to reach a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $925,000 is tempting, I'm still not comfortable selling for less than $950,000. I'll try to counteroffer once more and see if we can reach a deal closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. Let's split the difference. I'm prepared to offer the product for $937,500. This is a fair price that reflects both of our positions.  Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 937500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but $937,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $920,000, but I think that's the maximum I can go. I'm hoping we can find a way to meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While I'd like to keep negotiating with Bob, we're getting close to the end of our rounds.  The time is running out and I am not sure that I will be able to close the deal with Bob at a price close to my desired $1,200,000. I'll accept John's offer and sell the product to him, securing my target price."
