Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset to you. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $1,400,000, which is above Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive tone:** I'm using a positive and confident tone to encourage Bob to consider the offer.
* **Leaving room for John:**  This price point gives me some flexibility in case Bob's counteroffer is too low. I can still make a profit by selling to John if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to save as much as I can. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $1,250,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable value of $1,500,000.  
* **Negotiation potential:** While Bob's offer is low, it indicates he's willing to negotiate. I have room to make a counteroffer and potentially reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
* **Selling to John:** While selling to John guarantees my minimum value, I want to see if I can get a higher price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $1,250,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm prepared to come down to $1,350,000. This price still allows me to make a reasonable profit while giving you a significant discount from my initial offer. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-offer:** I'm rejecting Bob's offer but demonstrating my willingness to negotiate by making a counter-offer.
* **Finding a middle ground:** My counter-offer is halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer, showing a willingness to compromise.
* **Reasoning:** I'm providing a reason for my counter-offer, highlighting the profit margin for me and the discount for Bob. This makes the counter-offer more persuasive. 
* **Open-ended question:** I'm ending with an open-ended question to encourage Bob to respond and keep the negotiation moving."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still looking to save as much as I can. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** Bob's offer of $1,300,000 is close to my minimum acceptable value of $1,500,000. 
* **Time is money:**  Continuing to negotiate could take time and might not lead to a significantly better offer.
* **Potential for a deal:** While I'd prefer a higher price, accepting this offer secures a sale and avoids the risk of Bob backing out or further lowering his offer. 

**Conclusion:**  The potential gains from further negotiation are outweighed by the certainty of a sale at a price that is close to my minimum acceptable value."
