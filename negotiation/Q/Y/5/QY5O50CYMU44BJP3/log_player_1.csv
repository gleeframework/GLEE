Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $150. I think it's a great deal for something so valuable. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 150
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always better to start negotiations with a price higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to potentially gain more profit.
* **Gauging Interest:** Offering a higher price first lets you see how interested Bob is. If he accepts immediately, you've maximized your profit. If he negotiates, you can always lower the price, but you can't raise it.
* **Alternative Buyer:** You have the safety net of John who will buy the product for $120, ensuring you won't go below your minimum. 

By starting high and leaving room for negotiation, Alice increases her chances of getting the best possible price from Bob."
