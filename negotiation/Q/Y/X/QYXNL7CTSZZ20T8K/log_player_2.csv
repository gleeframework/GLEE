"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,400,000. This is a very competitive price, considering the product's worth to you is $1,000,000. I believe it's a fair compromise that benefits both of us. What do you think?

# Alice's message: Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I understand that $1,150,000 is a good price, but I'm still looking to get closer to my target. I'm willing to make one more compromise and sell the product to you for $1,225,000. This is a fair price that takes into account the value of the product to you and the value I place on it.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is getting closer to your maximum price, it's still above your budget. You've had multiple rounds of negotiations and it's unlikely she will come down to your desired price. It's better to cut your losses and buy from John at $1,000,000.  You've saved time and effort, and you've still acquired the product at a price you're comfortable with."
