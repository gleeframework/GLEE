"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for $120. It's a great value considering its worth of $150 to you, and I believe we can come to an agreement that satisfies both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above the product's worth to her ($80). There's room for negotiation to get a better deal. Rejecting the offer allows me to counteroffer and potentially get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate the offer, $120 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $100 for the product, which is still a good deal for you considering its value to you is $80.  Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 100}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and would like to make a counteroffer. Considering the value of the product to you and my costs, I propose a price of $110 for the product. I hope this aligns better with what you're looking for. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $110 is still slightly higher than her own value of $80, but it's significantly lower than the $150 I would pay John. This price is within my budget, and it's a reasonable compromise.  I'm happy to accept this offer and avoid the potential for further negotiation."
