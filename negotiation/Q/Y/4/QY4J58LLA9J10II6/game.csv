"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its unique value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations, and I'm open to discussing further.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer, but $1,100,000 is a bit outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering my needs and the product's value to me. What do you think?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the value. While $900,000 is a bit too low for me to consider, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,000,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $950,000. This represents a significant investment for me, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value to both of us. What do you say?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence in finding a mutually agreeable price.  While I'm still seeking a slightly higher number, I'm willing to come down a bit further.  How about $975,000? This reflects the true value of the product while acknowledging your investment.",975000.0,Alice,5,
