"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its unique value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations, and I'm open to discussing further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $1,100,000 is above his budget, and he can get a better deal from John."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer, but $1,100,000 is a bit outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering my needs and the product's value to me. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the value. While $900,000 is a bit too low for me to consider, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $1,000,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,000,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still a bit high. He can get the product from John for $800,000, so it's worth continuing to negotiate with Alice to see if he can get a better price."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,000,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $950,000. This represents a significant investment for me, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value to both of us. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence in finding a mutually agreeable price.  While I'm still seeking a slightly higher number, I'm willing to come down a bit further.  How about $975,000? This reflects the true value of the product while acknowledging your investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's offer of $975,000 is still higher than Bob's budget. At this point, it's more beneficial for Bob to buy the product from John for $800,000. Further negotiation with Alice might lead to a better price, but there's no guarantee. It's more efficient and less risky to go with the guaranteed price from John."
