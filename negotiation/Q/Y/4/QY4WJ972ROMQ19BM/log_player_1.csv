"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. I know it's worth a lot to me, but I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($8,000) but lower than my minimum ($15,000). This gives me room to negotiate and leaves space for Bob to counter.
* **Positive Tone:**  Using a friendly tone encourages a collaborative approach, making Bob more likely to engage.
* **Focus on Value:**  Mentioning that the product is worth a lot to me establishes its value and justifies the price. 
* **Room for Compromise:**  The phrase ""find a price that works for both of us"" acknowledges that I'm open to negotiation and avoids being overly aggressive.

**Next Steps:**

I'll analyze Bob's response and adjust my strategy based on his counteroffer or reaction. If the negotiation stalls, I can always move on to John and secure the $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a price of $10,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Counteroffer:**  Bob's counteroffer of $10,000 is still below my minimum value of $15,000. While it's closer than the initial $12,000, it's not yet an acceptable price for me.
* **Strategic Rejection:**  Rejecting his offer allows me to maintain control of the negotiation and continue to push for a higher price. 
* **Maintaining Leverage:** Selling to John for $15,000 is always an option, but rejecting Bob's offer keeps the possibility of a better deal with Bob open.

**Next Steps:**

I will counteroffer Bob with a price between $10,000 and my minimum of $15,000. I'll try to find a price that balances my need for a good profit with the potential of closing the deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $10,000 is still a bit too low for me. How about $11,500? This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I'm hoping it's a price we can both agree on."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** My counteroffer shows a willingness to compromise while still protecting my profit margin.
* **Reasoning:** I explain the reduction as a significant compromise to encourage Bob to accept. 
* **Positive Tone:**  The message remains friendly and collaborative, emphasizing the desire to reach a mutually agreeable price. 
* **Maintaining Leverage:**  This counteroffer leaves room for further negotiation, while still exceeding Bob's initial offer.

**Next Steps:**

* I'll assess Bob's response carefully. If he rejects my offer again, I might consider a slight increase in my counteroffer in the next round. 
*  If the negotiation continues to stall, I will still have the option to sell to John for $15,000, ensuring I don't lose out on a profitable deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. I'd like to keep the negotiations going. My counteroffer would be $11,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Target:** Bob's offer of $11,000 is very close to my counteroffer of $11,500.  It's a good deal for me, as it's significantly higher than his initial offer of $10,000 and brings me closer to my desired profit margin.
* **Avoiding Risk:**  While I could keep negotiating and aim for a slightly higher price, there's always a risk that Bob might walk away or the negotiation could stall further. Accepting his offer ensures a profitable sale.
* **Time Factor:** With only 6 rounds remaining, it's strategically beneficial to close the deal now and avoid further negotiation.

**Next Steps:**

I've secured a profitable sale with Bob, and I can now focus on other opportunities."
