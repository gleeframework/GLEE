"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $9,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  How about $8,500? That's a fair price for both of us, and it would allow me to move forward with the purchase.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is just a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $9,000?  I'm confident this price will still be a great value for you.",9000.0,Alice,3,
