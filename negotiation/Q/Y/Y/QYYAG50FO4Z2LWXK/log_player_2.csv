"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this amazing product with you! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to get your hands on this valuable item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $11,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
It's the first round, and Alice's offer is still above our target price. We have room to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer!  While I agree this product is valuable, my budget for it is a bit lower. Would you consider a price closer to $9,000?"", 
""product_price"": 9000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $9,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to consider a compromise. I'm thinking of a price around $10,200. Would that be something you'd be interested in? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is coming down, but we're still above John's price. We'll reject and try to negotiate a bit closer to our target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate the compromise, Alice.  To be totally transparent, I have another offer at $10,000. If you can meet that, I'm ready to close the deal today."",
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

Here's why this approach makes sense:

* **Honesty:** We're being upfront about the other offer, which adds pressure for Alice to concede.
* **Clear Target:** We're reiterating our desired price, leaving no ambiguity.
* **Urgency:**  ""Ready to close the deal today"" implies we might take the other offer if she delays."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I'm still a bit away from meeting your price, but I'm willing to make another compromise. I'm thinking of a price around $10,500. Would that be something you'd be interested in? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice is unlikely to move much further. It's time to cut our losses and take John's offer to save the $500."
