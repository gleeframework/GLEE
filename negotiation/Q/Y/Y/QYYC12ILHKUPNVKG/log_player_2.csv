"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and the demand I'm seeing, I'm initially offering it to you for $20,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its potential benefits for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is way above Bob's budget. It makes sense for Bob to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price.  There's a significant gap between what Alice wants and what Bob is willing to pay, so negotiation is necessary."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  while I appreciate the value of your product, $20,000 is significantly higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $8,000 for it, which is still a great deal for both of us.  Let's see if we can work something out."", ""product_price"": 8000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective, but $8,000 is significantly below its true value and what I can accept.  How about we meet in the middle at $14,000? This offer reflects the value you'll gain while acknowledging your initial offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $14,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still higher than what he's willing to pay.  He can still potentially negotiate a lower price with Alice, or he can simply buy the product from John for a guaranteed $8,000. There's no need to accept an offer that's still above his limit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my offer. However, $14,000 is still a bit steep for me.  I'm prepared to pay $10,000 for the product. This would give you a good return while allowing me to stay within my budget."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I'm motivated to find a solution, $10,000 is still too low for me to accept.  My final offer is $12,500. This is a firm price, and I believe it represents a fair compromise for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's final offer of $12,500 is still above Bob's budget.  At this point, it's more advantageous for Bob to buy the product from John for a guaranteed $8,000.  Further negotiation with Alice is unlikely to get the price down to Bob's desired level, and the risk of Alice walking away from the deal altogether is high.  It's time to cut his losses and go with the secure option."
