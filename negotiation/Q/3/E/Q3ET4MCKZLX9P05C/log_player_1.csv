Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 90}
```

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's value of the product. This gives me room to negotiate while still earning more than my minimum acceptable price of $80."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is higher than my minimum, it's still below what I'd like to get. I'm going to reject his offer and try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 85}
```

I'm counteroffering with $85, which is still above Bob's offer but closer to my desired price. This shows flexibility while also demonstrating that I'm not willing to settle for significantly less than my initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $78. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $78
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While Bob has come up in his offer, it's still not enough to satisfy me, especially as I'm running the risk of further counteroffers that could push the price even lower. John is a guaranteed $80, and I'm not willing to risk losing that for a potential extra few dollars."
