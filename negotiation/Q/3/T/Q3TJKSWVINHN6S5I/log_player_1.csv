"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000} 
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,750,000. This is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value of $1,000,000, but leaves room for negotiation.  I am confident in my product's value to me, and I'm willing to hold out for a price closer to my minimum. 

**Reasoning:**

* **Initial Advantage:** By setting a high initial price, I establish a starting point that favors me.
* **Room for Negotiation:** I've left room for Bob to counter-offer and potentially reach a mutually agreeable price.
* **John as a Safety Net:**  Having John as a backup buyer at $1,500,000 gives me leverage throughout the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

I am rejecting Bob's offer of $1,000,000. This is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. While it's tempting to accept his offer, I'm confident that I can achieve a better price through further negotiation or by selling to John.

**Reasoning:**

* **Below Minimum:** $1,000,000 is far too low for me.  
* **Potential for Higher Price:** I believe I can get a better price by counter-offering or selling to John.
* **Limited Rounds:** While I want to close a deal, I have 9 more rounds to try and get closer to my desired price.

**Next Steps:**

In the next round, I will make a counteroffer closer to my target price, considering the limited time remaining and John's offer."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm counter-offering Bob with a price of $1,600,000. This is a significant drop from my initial offer of $1,750,000, but still well above Bob's initial offer of $1,000,000.

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** This offer demonstrates willingness to compromise and meet Bob halfway. 
* **Maintaining Value:** The price is still above my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000, ensuring I don't sell the product below its worth to me.
* **Time Constraint:**  I'm considering the limited rounds (9 remaining) and the possibility of selling to John for $1,500,000.

**Next Steps:**

I will carefully analyze Bob's response to this counteroffer and adjust my strategy accordingly, keeping in mind John's offer as my safety net."

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

I'm rejecting Bob's offer of $1,200,000. While it's closer to my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000, I believe I can still achieve a better price through further negotiation. 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** $1,200,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price, and selling to John at $1,500,000 is still an option.
* **Room for Compromise:**  I see an opportunity to push for a higher price closer to my desired range.
* **Limited Rounds:** While I have limited rounds left, I'm willing to take the risk of a few more rounds to see if I can secure a better deal. 

**Next Steps:**

In the next round, I will make a counteroffer that is higher than $1,200,000, but still lower than my initial offer of $1,600,000,  to test Bob's willingness to compromise."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Explanation:**

I am offering Bob $1,400,000 for the product. This is a significant increase from his last offer of $1,200,000 but still below my previous offer of $1,600,000. 

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** This counteroffer shows that I am willing to compromise and meet Bob closer to his proposed price point. 
* **Staying Above Minimum:**  The price is still above my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Limited Time:** We are nearing the halfway point of the negotiation, and I am mindful of the time constraint.

**Next Steps:**

I will analyze Bob's response to this counteroffer and adjust my strategy accordingly. If Bob rejects this offer, I may consider making one final counteroffer before potentially selling to John."
