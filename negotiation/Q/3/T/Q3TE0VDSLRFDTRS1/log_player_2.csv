"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $95. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is too high. There's a good chance we can negotiate a lower price.  We're aiming for under $100, and we know Alice values the product at $80, so there's room for bargaining."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $95 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $70?"",
""product_price"": 70
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** We're starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's initial price. This gives us room to negotiate upwards while still staying below our $100 maximum.
* **Polite and Interested:** The message is framed positively to maintain a good negotiating relationship with Alice. 
* **Strategic Aim:** By aiming low, we're trying to gauge Alice's flexibility and get closer to her $80 valuation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest, Bob.  While I'm aiming for a higher price, I could come down to $87. I believe this product offers significant value, and this is a fair offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $87. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $87
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice came down in price, which is a good sign. However, $87 is still a bit high considering her product valuation is $80, and we can get it for $100 from John.  We'll try to negotiate a bit further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand the value, Alice, and I appreciate you working with me. How about we meet in the middle at $80?"",
""product_price"": 80
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Direct Approach:** We're proposing a price that matches Alice's valuation. This is a strong negotiating tactic to see if she's willing to sell at her minimum.
* **""Meeting in the middle"":** This phrasing creates a sense of fairness and compromise, even though we're aiming for her lowest acceptable price.
* **Alternative Option:** We're still below John's $100 offer, giving us leverage in case Alice rejects this counteroffer."
