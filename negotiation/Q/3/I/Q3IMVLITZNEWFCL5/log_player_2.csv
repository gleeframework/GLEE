"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that I know you'll find incredibly valuable. It's worth at least $1,200,000 to you, and I'm willing to let it go for a price that's fair for both of us.  Let's talk about a price that works for both of us.   
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Here's why:

* **Alice's offer is high:** $1,150,000 is closer to your maximum budget than it is to a fair deal. 
* **Negotiating power:** By rejecting Alice's initial offer, you signal that you're looking for a better price. Alice is motivated to sell and might come back with a lower offer.
* **John is the backup:** While you want to save money, John provides a guarantee that you'll get the product for $1,200,000 if negotiations with Alice completely fail."
