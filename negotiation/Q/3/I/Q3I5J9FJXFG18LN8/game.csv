"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but the price is a bit high for me right now. Would you consider $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $800,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1,100,000. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  How about $950,000? I think that's a fair price that reflects the value it brings to my business.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, but $950,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to make one more concession. How about $1,050,000? It's a good compromise that still reflects the product's value, and I think it's worth considering.",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad we're getting close. However, $975,000 is still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to make one more concession. How about $1,075,000? It's a fair price that reflects the product's value, and I think it's worth considering.",1075000.0,Alice,7,
