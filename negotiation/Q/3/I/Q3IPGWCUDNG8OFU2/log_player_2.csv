"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering its value. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $1,100,000 is a better price than John's offer, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $1,050,000.  This is still a good deal for you, and it allows me to stay within my budget. Let's see if we can work something out."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $1,050,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to $1,100,000 to make this work.  Let's try to find a middle ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is the same as Round 1, Bob should still reject it. He knows he can get the product for less than $1,200,000 from John, and Alice has already indicated a willingness to negotiate further.  Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation open and gives Bob another opportunity to try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I hear you. How about we meet in the middle at $1,075,000? This is a fair compromise that allows us both to get a good deal.  Let's close this deal and move on."", ""product_price"": 1075000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,075,000 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,090,000, but I can't go lower than that.  Let's make this happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,090,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,090,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is a good opportunity for Bob to close the deal.  

* Alice has come down significantly from her initial price.
* This price is still lower than what Bob would pay to John.
* There are only five rounds left, and further negotiation may not lead to a better price.

By accepting the offer, Bob saves $10,000 compared to buying from John."
