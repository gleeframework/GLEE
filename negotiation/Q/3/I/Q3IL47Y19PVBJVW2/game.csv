,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I recognize the value of this product, $2,000,000 is significantly higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to offer $1,250,000 for it, which is still a fair price considering its potential. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1250000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand your perspective on the value. However, $2,000,000 represents a significant gap from my position. To find a middle ground, I'd be willing to consider $1,750,000.",1750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,750,000 remains a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000, which is a fair compromise considering my budget and the value of this product. Let's see if we can close the deal at this price.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
