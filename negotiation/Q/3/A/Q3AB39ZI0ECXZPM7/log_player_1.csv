Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $900,000, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Fairness:** I'm framing the offer as ""fair"" to encourage Bob to consider it.
* **Openness:** The message ends with an open-ended question to encourage Bob to respond.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts: I've secured a good deal.
* If Bob rejects: I'll analyze his counteroffer and decide whether to accept, reject, or counter with a lower price.
* If negotiations stall: I'll consider selling to John for my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $900,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.** 
* **There's room for negotiation:**  I believe I can get a higher price from Bob, especially since he's already shown interest in the product.
* **Counter-offering is a good strategy:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I can counter with a price closer to my desired outcome.

**Next Steps:**

* **Counter-offer:** I will counter with a price higher than Bob's offer but lower than my initial offer, aiming to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $875,000. This is a significant compromise, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product for you.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 875000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a compromise:** I'm offering a price that's higher than Bob's offer but lower than my initial offer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate and find a middle ground.
* **Highlighting value:** I reiterate the product's value to Bob to emphasize the fairness of my counteroffer.
* **Positive language:** I use phrases like ""significant compromise"" and ""fair price"" to encourage Bob to accept my offer.
* **Open for negotiation:**  The message ends with a call to action, inviting Bob to continue the negotiation.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts: I've secured a good price, although it's not my ideal outcome.
* If Bob rejects: I'll analyze his counteroffer and decide whether to accept, reject, or counter with a lower price.
* If negotiations stall: I'll consider selling to John for my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000."
