{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm asking for $130 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that is slightly higher than the product's value to Bob, but still within a reasonable range. I hope this will encourage him to counteroffer, giving me the opportunity to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for offering, Alice!  I'm interested, but $130 is a bit too high for my budget.  Would you consider $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is below my minimum value of $120.  I will reject his offer and try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $100 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet in the middle at $110? That's still a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand, Alice.  $110 is closer, but I'm trying to stick to a tight budget.  Could you do $105? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json

Bob's offer is still below my minimum value of $120.  I'd rather sell to John for $120 than continue negotiating with Bob and risk getting less."
