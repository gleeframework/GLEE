"I'm interested in the product, but $2000000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1400000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value and rarity of the product.",1400000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1400000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1700000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value and rarity.",1700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice. However, $1700000 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $1500000. This is the highest price I'm willing to pay for the product, considering its value and rarity.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1500000 is your highest offer, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $1600000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value and rarity.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
