Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's how Alice should approach this negotiation:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Reservation Value:** Alice's lowest acceptable price is $12,000. This is her walk-away point. Bob's maximum willingness to pay is $10,000.
* **Zone of Possible Agreement (ZOPA):**  There's no overlap between Alice's minimum price and Bob's maximum price. For a deal to happen, either Alice needs to lower her expectation or Bob needs to increase his.
* **John's Guarantee:** Alice has a guaranteed sale at $12,000 from John. This gives her strong leverage.

**Alice's Strategy**

Alice should start with an offer slightly below her guaranteed price. This creates a sense of urgency for Bob while still allowing Alice room to negotiate if needed.

**The Offer**

```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product for $11,500. This is a limited-time offer, as I have another interested buyer.  Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Explanation**

* **High Opening:** The offer is closer to Alice's minimum and above Bob's maximum, but it's within a potentially negotiable range.
* **Urgency:**  Mentioning another buyer (even if unspecified) creates time pressure for Bob to decide.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message implies Alice might be willing to negotiate slightly, but not significantly. 

**Outcome**

* **Bob Accepts:** Unlikely, unless he's willing to pay more than his perceived value.
* **Bob Rejects:** The most probable outcome. Alice can then sell to John for her guaranteed price.

**Important Note:** Alice should be prepared to walk away from Bob's counter-offers if they fall below $12,000. She has a secure alternative with John."
