"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

This offer is a good starting point. It's significantly higher than your minimum price of $800,000, but still leaves room for negotiation. Bob knows the product is worth $1,500,000 to him, so he has a strong incentive to negotiate. This first offer sets the stage for a potentially profitable back-and-forth."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, I want to see if I can squeeze out a better deal. I'll reject his offer and try to get closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

I'm going to lower my offer slightly, but still keep it above Bob's counteroffer. This shows that I'm willing to negotiate but also that I believe the product is worth more than $1,000,000. This approach keeps the negotiations moving forward and gives Bob a clear incentive to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum price, I still believe I can get a better price. I'll reject his offer and continue negotiating with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

I'm lowering my offer again, but still staying above Bob's latest offer. I'm trying to find a middle ground and see if we can reach a compromise. This also keeps the pressure on Bob, as he knows he can always walk away and sell the product to John for $800,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm still holding out for a better price. I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price with a few more rounds of negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm going to meet Bob halfway on this round. I'm confident that he's willing to pay a bit more than his last offer, and this demonstrates my willingness to compromise.  This should hopefully put us closer to a final agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

With only three rounds remaining, I don't have much time to negotiate. While I'd prefer to get closer to my desired price, selling to John guarantees me a profit of $100,000. The risk of failing to reach an agreement with Bob and being left with a lower sale price is too high at this point."
