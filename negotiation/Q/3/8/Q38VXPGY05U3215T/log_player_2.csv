"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,100,000 is fair. What do you think?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is too high.  You are willing to pay up to $1,200,000, but you want to save as much money as possible.  It makes sense to try and negotiate a lower price with Alice before resorting to buying from John."

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $950,000 is a tempting offer, I'm confident this product's true value justifies a higher price. How about we meet halfway at $1,025,000?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
