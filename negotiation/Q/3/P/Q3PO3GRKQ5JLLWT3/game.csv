"I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob. However, I've got to make a profit on this deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering $11,000. It's the lowest I can go, but I think it's still a fair price for the product.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  How about we settle at $10,500? That's a fair compromise, don't you think?",10500.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $10,500. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'm counteroffering $10,750. That's as low as I'm willing to go.",10750.0,Alice,5,
