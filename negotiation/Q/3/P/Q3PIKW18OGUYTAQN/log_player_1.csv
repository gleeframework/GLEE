{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $1,650,000. It's a fair price considering the value it holds for you.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1650000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price that is higher than what the product is worth to you, but still potentially attractive to Bob. It also opens the door for further negotiation. If Bob rejects, you can gauge his interest and adjust your offer accordingly. You can also always go back to John for a guaranteed $1,500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $1,650,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $1,400,000. Would you be willing to consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,400,000 is a significant amount, it's still less than the product's worth to Bob, and it's lower than the guaranteed amount from John. There's room for negotiation to get closer to the target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective.  $1,400,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference? I'm willing to go down to $1,525,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1525000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,525,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll propose $1,450,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's final offer of $1,450,000 is still lower than the guaranteed $1,500,000 from John.  It's time to take the sure thing and sell to John."
