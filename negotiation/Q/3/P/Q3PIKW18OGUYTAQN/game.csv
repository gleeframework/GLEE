"I'm interested in the product, but $1,650,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $1,400,000. Would you be willing to consider this price?",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective.  $1,400,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference? I'm willing to go down to $1,525,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you say?",1525000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,525,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll propose $1,450,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",1450000.0,Bob,4,
