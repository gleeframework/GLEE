,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $200 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $120.",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob. However, I'm still confident that the product is worth more than $120. How about we meet in the middle at $170? I'm willing to compromise to find a mutually beneficial price.",170.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $170 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'm willing to meet you halfway from $120, so I'll offer $145. Can you consider that?",145.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your desire to get a good deal, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $145. How about we meet at $160? It's a bit higher than your offer, but still a compromise from my original price.",160.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm still not comfortable with $160. I'm willing to go up to $155, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. Can you meet me at that price?",155.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand your limitations, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $155. I'm willing to make one more compromise. How about we meet at $157? It's a small step down from my original price, but I'm willing to make it to find a deal.",157.0,Alice,7,
