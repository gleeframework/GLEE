"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to own this incredible product.  Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000.  I'm confident that this product will exceed your expectations and deliver significant returns. What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 2300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** By starting significantly higher than both Bob's perceived value and your minimum acceptable price, you create room for negotiation and potentially secure a price closer to your ideal outcome. 
* **Justification:**  Mentioning the ""unique value and potential"" helps justify the high initial price, even if you're willing to go lower.
* **Open Communication:**  Phrases like ""What are your thoughts?"" encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation process. 

**Important Considerations for Future Rounds:**

* **Bob's Reactions:**  Carefully analyze Bob's counteroffers. How much is he willing to move? This will give you insight into his perceived value.
* **John as Leverage:** Remember, you have John as a backup offer. Don't be afraid to use this as leverage if negotiations with Bob stall or become unreasonable.
* **Time Constraint:**  You have 10 rounds. Be mindful of how much time is left and adjust your strategy accordingly. You might become more flexible with the price as the rounds progress."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product, I believe your initial asking price is significantly above its current market value. I'm prepared to offer $800,000 as a starting point for our negotiations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Far Below Value:** Bob's offer of $800,000 is significantly below both your minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000) and his own perceived value ($1,000,000). Accepting this would be a substantial loss.
* **Negotiation Tactic:** This low offer is likely a negotiation tactic to see how low you're willing to go. By rejecting it, you signal that you're serious about obtaining a fair price.

**Next Steps (Round 3 Preparation):**

* **Counteroffer:**  Propose a counteroffer significantly higher than Bob's, but lower than your initial offer. Aim for around $1,900,000.
* **Justification:**  When presenting your counteroffer, re-emphasize the product's unique value and potential.  You can also subtly reference market trends or comparable products that support a higher price point. 
* **Gauge Bob's Response:**  Pay close attention to how Bob reacts to your counteroffer in Round 3. His willingness to move towards your price range will indicate if a mutually beneficial agreement is possible."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you taking the time to consider my initial offer.  While I understand your perspective on the market value, I believe your offer doesn't fully reflect the unique advantages this product offers. Taking its long-term earning potential into account, I'm proposing a price of $1,900,000. This feels like a fair reflection of its true worth."",
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Drop, Above Minimum:** This counteroffer drops by $400,000 from your initial price, showing flexibility. However, it remains significantly above Bob's offer and well above your minimum acceptable price.
* **Value Emphasis:**  The language continues to highlight the ""unique advantages"" and ""long-term earning potential,"" justifying the high price without directly referencing market comparisons (which Bob might dispute).
* **Seeking Middle Ground:** This counteroffer aims to move the negotiation toward a middle ground. Ideally, Bob will respond with a counter that's closer to the $1,500,000 mark."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, the price gap between your offer and my valuation remains substantial. To move this forward, I'm proposing $950,000. I believe this offer reflects a fair compromise, acknowledging the product's potential while remaining within a reasonable market range. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Slow Progress:** Bob only increased his offer by $150,000, which suggests he's trying to draw out the negotiation and see if you'll crack under pressure.
* **Below Value:** Even with his increase, Bob's offer is still significantly below both your minimum price and his own perceived value of the product.
* **Leverage John:** It's time to remind Bob you have other options.  

**Next Steps (Round 5 Preparation):**

* **Strong Counteroffer:**  Propose a counteroffer around $1,700,000, maintaining a firm stance.
* **Mention John:**  Subtly introduce the possibility of selling to John by mentioning you've received interest from other parties. This adds a sense of urgency and reminds Bob he's not your only option. 
* **Prepare for Walk Away:** Be prepared to walk away from the negotiation if Bob doesn't significantly increase his offer in the next round or two. You have a guaranteed sale with John, so don't settle for a price that undervalues the product."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find common ground. However, your current offer doesn't reflect the value I'm confident this product holds. I've recently received interest from other parties willing to recognize its true worth. To be fair to you, I'm proposing $1,700,000.  I need to see a significant move on your end to justify continuing our negotiation."",
""product_price"": 1700000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:**  This counteroffer shows you're willing to negotiate but standing firm on a price that reflects the product's value.
* **Introducing John (Subtly):**  Mentioning ""other parties"" subtly introduces the possibility of selling to John without revealing your guaranteed offer. This creates a sense of urgency and competition.
* **Call to Action:**  Clearly stating that you ""need to see a significant move"" puts the ball in Bob's court and sets the expectation for a serious counter-offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but mentioning other potential buyers at this stage isn't particularly conducive to building trust in our negotiation. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,100,000, which is a significant move on my part.  Let's find a way to make this work for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too Low:** While Bob's offer has increased to $1,100,000, it remains significantly below your $1,500,000 minimum. 
* **Calling Out Tactics:** Bob is trying to manipulate the negotiation by framing your ""other buyers"" comment as detrimental to trust. This suggests he's feeling the pressure but not willing to make a truly serious offer yet.

**Next Steps (Round 7 Preparation):**

* **Final Counteroffer:**  It's time to present your final counteroffer. Offer $1,400,000, making it clear this is your bottom line. 
* **Deadline:**  Introduce a sense of urgency by setting a deadline for Bob's response (e.g., the end of the next round).
* **Walk Away Ready:** Be fully prepared to walk away and sell to John if Bob doesn't meet your $1,400,000 price. You've negotiated fairly and have a strong alternative."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I've been transparent about the value of this product and my willingness to negotiate a fair deal. My final offer is $1,400,000. I need a decision from you by the end of the next round. Otherwise, I'll be moving forward with another interested party. I believe this is a fair offer that allows you to acquire a valuable asset, and I hope we can close this deal."",
""product_price"": 1400000

```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:**  This counteroffer clearly states your non-negotiable bottom line ($1,400,000), giving Bob a final chance to secure the deal.
* **Deadline:** The deadline adds urgency, forcing Bob to make a decision quickly and preventing the negotiation from dragging on.
* **Polite but Firm:** The tone remains professional and encourages a deal, but you've clearly stated your intentions to walk away if necessary."
