"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll see its value. I'm willing to start the conversation at $1,200,000. What are your thoughts?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the opening offer. This product is interesting to me, but $1,200,000 is a little high for my budget.  Could you consider $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product and I'm willing to meet you halfway. However, I need to make a profit, so I'm willing to go as low as $1,100,000. This is my best and final offer in this range. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're trying to find a middle ground here.  How about we settle at $950,000?  That's a significant move on my part, and I think it's a fair price.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not quite ready to accept $950,000. I'm willing to meet you at $1,050,000, which is a compromise that still allows me to make a decent profit. This is my final offer in this range. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer. I'm willing to increase my offer to $980,000. This is a strong offer, and I'm hoping we can close the deal soon.",980000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I can see you're serious about this product, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to meet you at $1,050,000 was my previous best, but I can go a bit higher. I'll meet you at $1,020,000. This is my last offer, and I hope we can finalize the deal.",1020000.0,Alice,7,
