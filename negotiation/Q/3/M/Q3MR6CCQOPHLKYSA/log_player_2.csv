Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest, Bob. However, $10,000 is significantly below its true value. I could meet you halfway at $12,500. This offer reflects the product's worth and is a fair compromise.

Alice has come down to her lowest price. It's a good deal compared to John's offer, and further haggling is unlikely to yield a significantly better outcome."
