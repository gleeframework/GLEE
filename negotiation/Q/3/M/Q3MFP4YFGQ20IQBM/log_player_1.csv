Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value ($12,000). This gives me room for negotiation and leaves open the possibility of getting a better price than John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. $11,000 is below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. I'll counteroffer to try and get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500}
```

I'm counteroffering at $12,500. This is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway between his offer and my initial price. It's a fair price that still gets me closer to my desired value, but it also shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $11,500 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  While I could continue to negotiate, there's no guarantee we'll reach an agreement.  John is offering my minimum price, so it's the safest and most efficient option to sell to him and ensure I get the value I need."
