"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your product looks great, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $10,000.  Let's see if we can work something out. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm not willing to sell for less than $10,000 at this point. I'll counter Bob's offer and see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position. How about we meet in the middle at $11,000? This would still be a great price for you, and it would allow me to get closer to my target."", ""product_price"": 11000}
