"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for both of us! Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $12,000 is a good price, it's still higher than Alice's value of the product.  There's room for negotiation, and Bob should try to get a lower price.  Rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer allows Bob to potentially secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your product looks great, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $10,000.  Let's see if we can work something out."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial price, showing Bob is serious about getting a good deal. $10,000 is still above Alice's value, giving her some room to negotiate but also making it clear Bob is willing to walk away if the price isn't right."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position. How about we meet in the middle at $11,000? This would still be a great price for you, and it would allow me to get closer to my target. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to Bob's counteroffer, and $11,000 is a good deal for Bob.  He's saving $1,000 compared to Alice's initial offer, and he's still well below his maximum budget.  While he could try to negotiate further, accepting this offer minimizes risk and secures a good deal."
