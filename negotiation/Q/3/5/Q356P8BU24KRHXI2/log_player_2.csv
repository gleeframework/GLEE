(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,525,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is higher than what Bob is willing to pay.  She's gone above his initial target price.  With only one round remaining, it's unlikely that Alice will come down to a price that Bob is comfortable with.  Therefore, it's in Bob's best interest to buy from John, who is selling the product at a price that is within Bob's budget.  While John's price is higher than Bob's target, it's still a better option than accepting Alice's last offer."
