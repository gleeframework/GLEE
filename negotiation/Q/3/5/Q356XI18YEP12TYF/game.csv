"Thank you for your interest in the product, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to make an offer. However, I'm afraid $900000 is a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1050000. This is the lowest I can go, but I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $1050000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $950000 for the product. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",950000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $950000 is still a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $980000. This is the closest I can get to meeting you in the middle without going below my minimum value. What do you think?",980000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $960000 for the product. Can you meet me at this price?",960000.0,Bob,6,
