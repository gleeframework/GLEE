"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your desire to work within a budget, however, $700,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth. I could consider letting it go for $890,000. This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges the value it brings.",890000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I understand the value of the product, I am still looking to keep my expenses within my budget. Would it be possible to consider an offer closer to $800,000? I believe this would be a fair compromise for both of us.",800000.0,Bob,4,
