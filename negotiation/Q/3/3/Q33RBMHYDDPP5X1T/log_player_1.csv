Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm interested in this product, but I'm looking to spend closer to $1,200,000.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Round 3

}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,300,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm confident that we can find a mutually beneficial price.  How about we split the difference and agree on $1,250,000? This would be a good middle ground, allowing us both to walk away satisfied. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I believe I still have leverage and can secure a better price. We're still relatively early in the negotiation, and I'm willing to push a little further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you clearly recognize the value of this product, and I respect your negotiation skills.  Let's aim for a win-win. How about $1,275,000?  This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the true worth of what I'm offering."", 
""product_price"": 1275000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1,275,000 is still a bit high for me.  I think $1,260,000 would be a fair compromise that leaves both of us happy. Let's get this deal done. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,260,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,260,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob's offer is now at a level where the potential gains from further negotiation are outweighed by the risk of losing the deal. Accepting $1,260,000 ensures a substantial profit above my minimum acceptable price."
