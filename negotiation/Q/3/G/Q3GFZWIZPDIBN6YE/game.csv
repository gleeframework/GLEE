"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $11,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $13,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's still a great deal for you considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand you're looking for a fair price. How about we meet in the middle at $12,000? That's a reasonable compromise.",12000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit hesitant about $12,000.  How about we settle on $12,500? This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing you to get a great product and me to make a reasonable profit.  Let's reach an agreement!",12500.0,Alice,5,
