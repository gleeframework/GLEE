"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I get a fair price for the product. I'll offer it to you for $14000. This is as low as I'm willing to go. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm afraid I've already gone as low as I can. I'm not willing to sell the product for $13500. I'm still holding out for $14000. If you're not willing to meet me at that price, I'm afraid I'll have to consider other options.",14000.0,Alice,7,
