"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the value it offers. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at a price higher than my minimum acceptable value. This gives me room to negotiate downwards.
* **Emphasis on Value:**  I'm highlighting the value of the product to Bob to try and justify the price.
* **Open to Negotiation:** My message indicates I'm willing to negotiate, making it less likely Bob will immediately walk away. 

**Strategic Considerations:**

* **John's Offer:** I'm aware of John's offer of $1,000,000, which serves as my fallback option. 
* **Negotiation Rounds:** I have 10 rounds, but I want to close the deal as quickly as possible.  Starting high allows me to potentially end the negotiation early."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the product's value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:**  While $900,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable value, I'm still not comfortable with it.  It's significantly lower than my initial offer and I believe I can do better.
* **Negotiation Leverage:**  I have 8 rounds remaining and John's offer as a safety net. This allows me to push for a better price.
* **Potential for a Higher Counteroffer:** I'm confident that I can make a counteroffer that Bob will find more appealing, potentially leading to a deal closer to my initial asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. However, $900,000 doesn't quite reflect the true value of this product for you.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This is a significant price reduction, and it's my final offer.  Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Counteroffer:**  I'm offering a counteroffer that is still above my minimum value but shows a willingness to compromise. This can make Bob feel like we are closer to agreement. 
* **Final Offer:**  By calling it my ""final offer"", I'm adding pressure to Bob to accept or risk losing the deal. 
* **Value Emphasis:**  I'm again reminding Bob of the product's value to him, even though he already knows. This reinforces the justification for a higher price. 

**Strategic Considerations:**

* **Time Factor:** We've already completed 2 rounds, leaving me with 8 remaining. While I'm not in a rush, I need to keep things moving toward a conclusion.
* **John's Offer:**  Remember, John's offer is always available, which gives me confidence in my negotiating position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think $950,000 is a more reasonable price for me. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Closing the Gap:** Bob's offer of $950,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable value of $1,000,000. Accepting this offer would secure a good deal, especially considering the remaining rounds and John's offer.
* **Time Consideration:**  We are already in Round 4, and accepting this offer will bring the negotiation to a close.  This leaves me with time to potentially find other buyers if needed.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** While I could potentially get a slightly higher price, the risk of further negotiation rounds not leading to a better offer is significant. 

**Strategic Considerations:**

* **John's Offer:** While John's offer is slightly higher, the time and effort involved in potentially finding a better buyer in the remaining rounds is not worth the small difference in price. 
* **Negotiation Fatigue:**  Both Bob and I have shown a willingness to negotiate, but the longer we go, the more likely it is that one of us will walk away.  Accepting this offer minimizes this risk."
