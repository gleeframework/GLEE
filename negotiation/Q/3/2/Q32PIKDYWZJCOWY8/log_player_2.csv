"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'll be very interested in. It's worth $10,000 to you, right? I'm willing to let it go for $11,000. This is a great deal, as I can easily sell it to someone else for $12,000.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

Alice is trying to convince me the product is worth $10,000 to me, but I should be cautious of her sales tactics. I know I can get the product for $10,000 from John, so I'll reject Alice's offer and go with the guaranteed lower price."
