"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling this amazing product to you. I've done my research and I think it's a great fit for you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,000. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you considering my needs. However, $9,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. Would you be willing to come down to $8,500? I'm very interested in this product and I think we can find a price that works for both of us.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go down to $8,500. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer you the product for $8,800. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",8800.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $8,800 is still a bit above what I'm comfortable with.  Would you be willing to consider $8,600?  I'm truly interested in this product, and I think this price would be a fair deal for both of us.",8600.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to make a fair deal. However, I'm still not willing to go down to $8,600. I'll offer you a compromise: I'll meet you at $8,700.
