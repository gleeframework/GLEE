"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling this amazing product to you. I've done my research and I think it's a great fit for you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go down to $8,500. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer you the product for $8,800. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's a fair compromise. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,800.

You're still trying to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is getting closer to your target, you can still try to negotiate further."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $8,800 is still a bit above what I'm comfortable with.  Would you be willing to consider $8,600?  I'm truly interested in this product, and I think this price would be a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 8600}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to make a fair deal. However, I'm still not willing to go down to $8,600. I'll offer you a compromise: I'll meet you at $8,700. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's a fair compromise. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,700. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,700
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's final offer is still higher than your target price of $8,000.  While you could continue negotiating, you're already at a point where you're risking losing the deal with Alice entirely.  Buying from John guarantees you the product at your target price, so it's the most sensible option."
