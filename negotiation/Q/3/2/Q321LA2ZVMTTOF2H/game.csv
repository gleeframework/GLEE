"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product has potential, $1,800,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to offer $800,000 to start the negotiation. Let me know what you think.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  I understand your perspective, but $800,000 significantly undervalues the product and its potential impact. I'm willing to come down to $1,500,000. This is a serious offer reflecting the true value of what's on the table.",1500000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for coming down. I appreciate you working with me.  While $1,500,000 is closer, I'm aiming for a price closer to $1,000,000. Would you consider $950,000? I think that's a fair offer that reflects the value this product brings.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $950,000 is still too low for a product of this caliber. I'm open to finding a middle ground, so I'm willing to accept $1,250,000. This is my final offer, as it represents a significant compromise on my end.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
