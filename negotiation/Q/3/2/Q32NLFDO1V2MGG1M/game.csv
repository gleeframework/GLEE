"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate it. However, $120 is a bit too high for my budget right now.  Would you be willing to come down to $60?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $120 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $60. How about we meet in the middle at $90? I think it's a fair price for this amazing product.",90.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  How about $75?  That feels like a fair compromise to me.",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $75 is still a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to compromise further. How about we try $85? It's the highest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for the product.",85.0,Alice,5,
