"Hello Alice, thank you for offering me the product. I understand its value, but I believe I can't afford $120 right now. Would you consider lowering the price to $100?",100.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is a bit too low for me right now.  I'm willing to come down to $110.  This gives us both a fair deal, and I can still make a decent profit.  Let me know what you think.",110.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $95 is unfortunately still too low for me.  Let's meet in the middle.  How about $105?  This would be a good compromise for both of us.  What do you think?",105.0,Alice,5,
