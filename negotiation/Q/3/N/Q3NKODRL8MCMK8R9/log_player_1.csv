Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000. This is a fantastic deal considering its worth to you. Let me know your decision soon, as I do have other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:**  While we know Bob values the product at $1,000,000, we don't want to start too low. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.
* **Justification of value:**  By mentioning ""value and potential,"" we subtly remind Bob of the product's worth without explicitly revealing our minimum price.
* **Sense of urgency:**  Mentioning ""other interested parties"" (even if it's just John) creates a fear of missing out and encourages Bob to act quickly.

**Goal:**  The aim is to secure the highest possible price from Bob while ensuring a sale. This strategy balances maximizing profit with the certainty of John's offer."
