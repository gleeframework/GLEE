{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $10,000.  It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's value:** $10,000 is more than $8,000, giving Bob some room to negotiate.
* **It's below your minimum:**  $10,000 is still above your minimum of $12,000, meaning you can still get a good deal if he accepts.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  If Bob counteroffers, you have space to negotiate and potentially reach a price that works for both of you."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am looking to keep my investment within $8,000. Would it be possible for us to negotiate the price down to that amount? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $8,000 is a better deal than nothing, it's still significantly below your minimum desired price of $12,000.  You have two good options:

* **Counteroffer:** You can try to negotiate a higher price with Bob.  There's still room for a compromise that's better than $8,000.
* **Sell to John:**  This guarantees you your minimum price. 

Since you are trying to maximize profit, it's wise to reject Bob's offer and see if you can do better."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  While I appreciate your offer, $8,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference?  I'm willing to come down to $9,000.  This is still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Middle ground:** This counteroffer offers a compromise that is halfway between your previous offer and Bob's offer. 
* **Still profitable:** $9,000 is above your minimum of $12,000, so it's still a good deal for you.
* **Room for negotiation:** If Bob rejects, you can always lower your price a bit more, but $9,000 is a good starting point to see if you can reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for considering my previous offer. I've given it some more thought, and I would like to propose $8,500 as a compromise. I believe this price reflects the value of the product while keeping it within my budget. I hope this proposal is acceptable to you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $8,500 is closer to your minimum price, it's still not ideal.  You have two good options:

* **Counteroffer:**  You can try to counteroffer again, perhaps with a price like $9,500.  This might be a good compromise that is closer to your desired price.
* **Sell to John:** This guarantees you your minimum price of $12,000.  

Since you are trying to maximize profit, you should reject Bob's offer and see if you can do better."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, and $8,500 is getting closer. However, I'm still not quite there yet.  Let's meet in the middle at $9,250. This is a fair price that allows me to make a reasonable profit while still giving you a good deal.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9250}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** This counteroffer is a further compromise, closer to Bob's last offer but still above your minimum price.
* **Reasonable profit:**  $9,250 is still significantly above your minimum of $12,000, ensuring you can earn a substantial profit.
* **Final offer:**  You might consider this as a final counteroffer to see if Bob is willing to meet you in the middle. If he rejects, you can always fall back on selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your continued efforts in negotiating. I've considered your latest offer, and I would like to propose $8,750 as a counteroffer. I believe this price strikes a balance between the value of the product and my budget. I hope this proposal is more in line with what you're looking for. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $8,750 is still below your minimum desired price of $12,000.  While you could continue negotiating, there's a risk that the process will drag on, and you might not be able to reach a mutually agreeable price.  At this point, it's more advantageous to sell the product to John for $12,000. This guarantees you your minimum price and saves you time and energy."
