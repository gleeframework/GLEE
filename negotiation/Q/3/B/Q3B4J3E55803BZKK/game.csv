"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you reaching out. While I'm interested, $11,500 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now.  Would you be willing to come down to $10,500?  That would be a great price for both of us.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position.  $10,500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $11,000?  That's a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to get closer to my desired value.  Let me know what you think.",11000.0,Alice,3,
