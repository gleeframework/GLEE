Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that I think you'd really love. I'm asking for $100 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Offering $100 is a good starting point. It's significantly less than Bob's perceived value ($120), giving him room to negotiate. 
* **Leaving Room:** This also leaves room for me to lower the price if necessary without dropping below my minimum of $80. 
* **Building Rapport:** The message is friendly and encourages engagement, making Bob feel comfortable starting the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $85. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Better Than John's Offer:** While $85 is close to my minimum of $80, it's still slightly better than what John is offering.
* **Room for Negotiation:**  I believe I can get a higher price than $85. There's still room to negotiate upwards, and Bob has shown interest in the product. 
* **Avoiding Premature Deal:** Accepting Bob's offer now might lead to regret later if I could have gotten a better price. 

I will counter Bob's offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $95 is my lowest price.  It's a great deal for a great product, and I think you'll be happy with it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer Strategy:** My counteroffer is closer to Bob's offer, signaling my willingness to compromise, but still higher than my minimum.
* **Stronger Position:** I've already established that I won't accept his initial offer, giving me a stronger position to negotiate.
* **Friendly Tone:** The message remains friendly and encourages further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $95, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Target:** $90 is very close to my desired price of $95. It's a good deal for me, considering I can always sell to John for $80.
* **Potential for Further Negotiation:**  While I could try to counteroffer again, there's a risk Bob will reject it and I'll be left with the $80 option.
* **Time and Effort:**  Continuing the negotiation might take more time and effort, and $90 is a good compromise."
