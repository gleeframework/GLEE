Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the potential benefits it holds for you."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $800,000.
* **Alice's Minimum:** Alice needs at least $1,500,000. 
* **John's Offer:** John acts as a safety net, guaranteeing Alice her minimum price.

**Strategy:**  Alice aims to get as much from Bob as possible before resorting to John. The offer of $1,300,000:

* **Exceeds Bob's Valuation:**  This encourages Bob to negotiate.
* **Provides Negotiation Room:** Alice has a buffer to potentially lower the price while still staying above her minimum. 

**Important Note:**  This is just an opening offer. Alice should be prepared to negotiate with Bob based on his responses."
