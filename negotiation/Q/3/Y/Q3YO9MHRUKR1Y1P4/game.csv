"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1000000. It's a great deal for you, as you know it's worth $1200000 to you. Let's make this happen!",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $900000.  This would be a good deal for both of us, as it leaves room for profit for you and gets me a significant discount. Let's see if we can make this work.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $900000 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $950000? That would be a fair compromise for both of us.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  While $950000 is a step in the right direction, I'm still hoping to get closer to $925000.  This would still be a profitable deal for you and a great price for me.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",925000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm feeling a little squeezed at $925000.  Let's compromise one last time at $940000.  This is a great price for you and still lets me make a decent profit. I'm really hoping we can reach an agreement and finalize this deal.",940000.0,Alice,5,
