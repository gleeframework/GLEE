"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1000000. It's a great deal for you, as you know it's worth $1200000 to you. Let's make this happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than buying from John, there's still room for negotiation.  I want to see if I can get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $900,000.  This would be a good deal for both of us, as it leaves room for profit for you and gets me a significant discount. Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $900000 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $950000? That would be a fair compromise for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is coming down, which is good.  $950,000 is still a bit high for me, but I'm willing to keep negotiating. I believe I can still get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  While $950,000 is a step in the right direction, I'm still hoping to get closer to $925,000.  This would still be a profitable deal for you and a great price for me.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 925000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm feeling a little squeezed at $925000.  Let's compromise one last time at $940000.  This is a great price for you and still lets me make a decent profit. I'm really hoping we can reach an agreement and finalize this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $940,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $940,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $940,000 is a good deal for me. It's significantly lower than John's price and still allows Alice to make a profit. I've already rejected a few offers, and I don't want to risk going through too many more rounds and potentially ending up with a worse deal. It's time to close this deal and secure the product at a good price."
