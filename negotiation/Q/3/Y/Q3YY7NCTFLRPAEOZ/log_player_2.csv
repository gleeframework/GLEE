{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice seems to be stuck at or above $10,500.  She's rejected our attempts to settle at $10,000.  While we could continue negotiating, we're running out of rounds.  It's not worth the risk of Alice not coming down further and ending up with no deal.  Buying from John for $12,000 ensures we get the product and stay within our budget."
