"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. It's a great deal considering the value it holds for you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 

This is a strong starting offer that is still within the range of what Bob might be willing to pay, given his value for the product. It also leaves room for negotiation while still ensuring a profit for you."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $1,750,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for it. Can we meet in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low.  While it's tempting to take the $1,300,000,  it's still significantly less than what I value the product at. I'll try to get closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $1,300,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $1,525,000?  That's a fair price considering the value it holds for you, and it gets us closer to a deal."", ""product_price"": 1525000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the compromise, but $1,525,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product. Can we meet somewhere in the middle again? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob is still offering below my minimum acceptable price.  While I want to close the deal, I'm not willing to settle for significantly less than what I value the product at.  I'll try one more counteroffer to see if we can reach an agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have a budget. I'm willing to come down a little more to $1,400,000.  This is a very fair price considering the value of this product to you. Let's close this deal. "", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to my budget, but I still need to save some money. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. Can we meet at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is still too low.  I've made several concessions and we're running out of time.  It's time to cut my losses and sell to John for a guaranteed $1,500,000."
