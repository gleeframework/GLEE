Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 110} 
```

I'm starting with a price of $110. This is a reasonable starting point as it's a bit higher than Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation. I'm aiming for the highest price I can get, but also want to keep the negotiation open."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer of $100. While it's closer to my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price. I'm going to counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 105} 
```

I'm offering a counteroffer of $105. It's a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer, and it's still above my minimum price of $120. Hopefully, this will convince Bob to accept the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $120.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my original asking price, the negotiation with Bob has gone on for a while and I'm starting to feel that he's not willing to go higher.  John is a sure thing, and I can't risk him changing his mind or another buyer appearing."
