"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a fair price considering the value it holds.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is too high. We have room to negotiate down towards our budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but that price is a bit high for me.  Would you consider $600,000?"",
""product_price"": 600000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** This offer is significantly lower than Alice's starting point, but it gives us room to negotiate upwards. 
* **Anchoring:** By throwing out a low number first, we might influence Alice to consider lower prices than she initially intended.
* **Leaving Room:**  We have plenty of space between $600,000 and our $800,000 maximum to make counteroffers if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest but $600,000 is simply not viable for me.  Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to come down to $800,000.  This still gives you a good deal, and it's a price I can comfortably accept. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Matching Our Limit:** Alice's offer now exactly matches our budget of $800,000. 
* **No Need to Risk Further Negotiation:** While we *might* be able to get the price lower, there's no guarantee Alice would go any further. It's not worth the risk of losing the deal entirely. 
* **John's Offer is Identical:**  Since John is offering the same price, there's no advantage to going with him over Alice at this point."
