Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it would be highly valuable to you, and I'm willing to part with it for $14,000."", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's $15,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting with $14,000 gives Bob the feeling he's getting a slight discount while still securing a significant profit for you. 
* **Strong Alternative:** Knowing you have a guaranteed sale at $10,000 with John gives you leverage. You're not desperate to sell to Bob at any cost. 

This strategy aims for a win-win situation. Bob gets the product at a price he's willing to pay (and lower than his perceived value), while you secure a $4,000 profit, which is significantly better than your alternative."
