{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. I think you'll find it incredibly valuable. I'm willing to let it go for $14,500."", ""product_price"": 14500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to $15,000 as possible. Offering it slightly below this price creates a sense of urgency and a good deal for Bob.
* **Bob's Valuation:** We know Bob values the product at $12,000. Offering it at $14,500 leaves room for negotiation but ensures Alice gets a price significantly higher than Bob's valuation.
* **Backup Offer:** Having John as a guaranteed buyer at $15,000 provides a strong fallback position. This allows Alice to be firm in her negotiation with Bob."
