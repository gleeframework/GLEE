"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you place on the product. However, based on my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the price of $1300000. I am willing to offer $1150000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",1150000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1150000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1250000. This price still reflects the product's value and provides a fair return for me. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. Based on my assessment, I am comfortable with a price closer to $1200000. Given our previous discussions, I am willing to offer $1225000 for the product. I believe this price respects both our interests.",1225000.0,Bob,4,
