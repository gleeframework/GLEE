"I appreciate your time and consideration, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe it's a fair price given the market value and my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $900,000 is closer, I'm still not able to go that low.  However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let's settle on $1,050,000.  This price recognizes your budget and still allows me to make a fair profit.  This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a good deal for both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $1,050,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to compromise, but I can only go up to $950,000. I believe this is a fair price that balances our interests.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1,000,000. This is a significant concession on my part, but it shows my commitment to reaching a deal. We're both getting close to a mutually beneficial agreement. Time is ticking, though, and I might need to explore other options if we don't reach a conclusion soon.",1000000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1,000,000, but I'm still a bit above that. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $950,000 and $1,000,000, so I'm offering $975,000. I believe this is a fair price that balances our interests and gets me the product at a price I'm comfortable with.",975000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting very close. I understand you're at your limit with $975,000, but I'm also reaching my limit.  I'm willing to go down to $990,000, which is just a little bit higher. With only a few rounds left, we need to come to an agreement.  I'm committed to finding a solution that works for both of us, but I also need to ensure a fair deal for myself.  What do you say?",990000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not willing to go up to $990,000. I'm willing to make one final offer of $980,000. I believe this is the highest price I'm willing to pay, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",980000.0,Bob,8,

"Bob, we're down to the wire here.  I truly appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I've carefully considered your offer, and I'm willing to make one final concession. I'm offering $985,000.  This is the absolute best I can do, and it represents a significant compromise on my part. It's a fair price that gives you a great deal on the product, and it allows me to make a profit.  If we don't come to an agreement, I'll have to explore other options, and you might miss out on this fantastic opportunity.  Let's make this happen!",985000.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to make concessions, but I'm still not willing to pay $985,000. I've reached my limit, and I'm willing to walk away if we can't agree on a price. My final offer is $980,000, and I'm not budging from that. If you're not willing to accept it, I'll have to consider buying the product from John for $800,000.",980000.0,Bob,10,
