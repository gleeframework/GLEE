"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a high offer of $15,000. This is a bold move, but I believe it's necessary to maximize my potential profit.  Here's why:

* **High starting point:** It sets a strong baseline and leaves room for negotiation.
* **Testing the waters:** It allows me to gauge Bob's interest and potential budget. 
* **Time is valuable:** I want to quickly understand if a deal is possible within my desired range.

If Bob rejects this offer, I'll analyze his counteroffer and adjust my strategy accordingly in the following rounds. I'll keep in mind the possibility of selling to John for $10,000 as a safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $12,000 is a decent offer, it's still below my ideal price point. I'm willing to negotiate further.  Here's why:

* **Room for improvement:** There's still a gap between Bob's offer and my desired price. I'm hopeful we can find a compromise.
* **Ten rounds:** I have time to work with Bob and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price.
* **Potential for higher gain:**  I'm confident I can secure a better price than $12,000.

I'll counter Bob's offer with a price closer to my initial asking price in the next round. However, I'll also consider his counteroffer carefully and adjust my strategy if necessary."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500} 
```

**Explanation:**

I'm counteroffering with $13,500. Here's my reasoning:

* **Compromise:** This price is halfway between my initial offer and Bob's last offer, showing a willingness to negotiate.
* **Reasonable expectation:**  I believe $13,500 is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and leaves room for Bob to feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **Strategic positioning:**  This offer allows me to gauge Bob's true budget and see if he's willing to meet me halfway.

If Bob rejects this offer, I'll evaluate his next counteroffer and make a strategic decision in the following rounds.  I'll continue to keep in mind the option of selling to John for $10,000 if I feel the negotiation with Bob is not going in my favor."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $13,000 is getting closer to my desired price. While it's still slightly below my initial target, I believe accepting this offer is the most sensible strategy at this point:

* **Time is money:**  We're already four rounds in, and continuing to negotiate might lead to a stalemate.
* **Gaining momentum:** Accepting this offer allows me to close the deal and avoid potential risks of further negotiation.
* **Potential for future deals:** Even if I could potentially get a slightly higher price, the certainty of this deal is more valuable to me.

By accepting Bob's offer, I secure a good profit and avoid the uncertainty of further negotiation, which might lead to a rejection or even a worse outcome."
