"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,150,000. I believe this price is fair, considering the value it holds for you. Let's start our negotiation with this offer. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the value I'll get from this product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'll reject Bob's offer. While $900,000 is better than nothing, it's still far below my minimum acceptable price.  I believe I can get closer to my desired price through further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $900,000 is significantly below what I'm willing to accept. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This price is still above your initial offer but significantly lower than my first proposal. I'm confident this is a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our initial offers. How about $1,025,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'll accept Bob's offer.  While I'd prefer a higher price, $1,025,000 is a good compromise, especially considering I'm close to the end of my negotiation rounds. It's also significantly higher than what John is offering, so it's in my best interest to finalize this deal with Bob."
