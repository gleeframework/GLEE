Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $9,500. I believe it offers significant value, but I'm happy to discuss the price further if you have any questions."",
""product_price"": 9500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to $10,000 as possible, but still offer Bob a price that's enticing.
* **Above Bob's Value:** $9,500 is more than Bob values the product at ($8,000), but it leaves room for negotiation if Bob is interested.
* **Below John's Offer:** This ensures that if Bob rejects the offer, Alice doesn't lose money by selling to John.
* **Open to Discussion:** The message leaves room for negotiation, signaling flexibility without immediately dropping the price."
