"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $1,100,000 is a bit lower than what I'm looking for, I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $1,250,000? It's still a good deal for you, considering the product's worth to you, and allows me to make a decent profit. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,175,000 is getting closer, I can't go lower than $1,225,000. This price still offers you a significant gain, and I'm confident it's fair considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can close the deal here.",1225000.0,Alice,5,
