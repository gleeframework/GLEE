"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested in the product but $90 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay right now.  How about $85?",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $90 might be a bit steep for you. However, I'm still looking to get a good price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $87.50. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",87.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $87.50 is still a little too high for me.  I'm firm on $85. If you're willing to meet me there, we can close the deal. ",85.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're firm on $85, Bob, but I'm still looking to get a good profit on the product. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $86.25. It's a small increase from my previous offer, but I think it's a fair compromise. Let me know if you're willing to meet me there.",86.25,Alice,5,
