"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $90 might be a bit steep for you. However, I'm still looking to get a good price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $87.50. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $87.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $87.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

You're still trying to get a better deal than $87.50. Rejecting and making a counteroffer is a better strategy than accepting or buying from John."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $87.50 is still a little too high for me.  I'm firm on $85. If you're willing to meet me there, we can close the deal. "", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're firm on $85, Bob, but I'm still looking to get a good profit on the product. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $86.25. It's a small increase from my previous offer, but I think it's a fair compromise. Let me know if you're willing to meet me there. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $86.25. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $86.25
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice has come down to $86.25, which is very close to your target of $85. It's a good deal for you, and you're likely to get a better price than you would from John.  At this point, it's worth accepting the offer and closing the deal."
