"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable item. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,500, a price that I believe is a fair compromise between our valuations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $12,500 is a better deal than buying from John for $15,000.  Even though it's more than the product is worth to Alice, it's still within Bob's budget and saves him $2,500."
