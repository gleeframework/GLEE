"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm afraid I need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to consider a price between $9000 and $12000, so I'll make a counteroffer of $11000. This is a fair price that I think reflects the value of the product, and I hope you'll consider it.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand you need to make a profit, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $9500, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at that price?",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, and I appreciate your flexibility. However, I'm still not comfortable selling the product for less than $11000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9500 and $11000, so I'll make a counteroffer of $10250. This is a compromise that I think is fair, and I hope you'll consider it.",10250.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still trying to stay within my budget. I'm willing to go up to $9500, but I'd like to make one more offer in the middle. Can you consider $9750?",9750.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to make one last offer. I'm not comfortable going below $11000, but I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9750 and $11000. Let's try $10375. This is my final offer, and I hope you'll consider it.",10375.0,Alice,7,
