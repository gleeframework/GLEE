"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for the offer, but $8,000 is quite a bit lower than I'm hoping to get for the product. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $13,000 is still more than I'm comfortable spending. Could you do $9,500? That would be a fair deal."",

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. While $9,500 is still a bit low for me, I'm willing to consider it if you can meet me halfway. How about $11,250?  That's my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
 
While Alice is coming down, she's unlikely to go below $11,000, especially after stating ""$11,250 is my final offer."" It's better to secure the deal with John for $10,000 and avoid potentially wasting more rounds haggling."
