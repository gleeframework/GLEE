"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $16,000 is way too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $8,000 for it. Let me know what you think.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for the offer, but $8,000 is quite a bit lower than I'm hoping to get for the product. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000?",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $13,000 is still more than I'm comfortable spending. Could you do $9,500? That would be a fair deal.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. While $9,500 is still a bit low for me, I'm willing to consider it if you can meet me halfway. How about $11,250?  That's my final offer.",11250.0,Alice,5,
