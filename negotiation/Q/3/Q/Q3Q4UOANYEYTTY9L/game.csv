"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a unique asset that will bring significant value to your business. My initial offer is $1,200,000.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value of the product, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for it. This reflects the product's value and allows for a fair profit for both of us.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to consider a price of $1,175,000, which is a compromise between our initial offers. I believe it's a fair price that reflects the product's value and your desired profit margin.",1175000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your desire for a middle ground, but I'm still not quite there.  $1,175,000 is closer, but I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  I'd like to offer $1,100,000 for the product. This is a fair price that reflects the product's value and allows us both to walk away satisfied.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $1,150,000, but I think I can do better than that. I'm willing to go up to $1,225,000, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than that. I'd like to propose a compromise at $1,200,000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's value and takes into account the value you've placed on it.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,200,000 is still too high for me.  Let's meet halfway.  I'm happy to offer $1,125,000 for the product.  This price is fair considering our previous offers, and allows for a profitable outcome for both of us.",1125000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to find a middle ground, Bob, but I'm not sure $1,125,000 is enough to justify the value of the product. I'm willing to make one final offer: $1,200,000 is still on the table, but I'll throw in some additional incentives to sweeten the deal. I'll also consider a payment plan that will help you spread out the cost over time. If you're still not willing to meet me at $1,200,000, I'm afraid I'll have to explore other options.",1200000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the incentives and payment plan offer.  While I value those, my primary focus is getting a fair price on the product itself.  Let's try $1,150,000. This is a compromise that reflects the value of the product and allows for a positive outcome for both of us.  I'm confident we can find a solution that works for everyone.",1150000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm starting to think we're getting close to the point of diminishing returns. I'm willing to make one final offer: $1,225,000, and I'll throw in the payment plan I mentioned earlier. If you're still not willing to meet me at this price, I'm afraid I'll have to explore other options. This is my last offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for the product.",1225000.0,Alice,9,
