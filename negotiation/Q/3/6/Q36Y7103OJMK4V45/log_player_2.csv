"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a mutually beneficial deal. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,200,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject the offer. While the offer is lower than Alice's value, it's still above Bob's maximum budget.  It makes sense to try to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,200,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. This is a fair price that allows both of us to walk away with a good deal."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking that we could meet in the middle and consider a price of $1,175,000. This is a fair price that takes into account the value you've placed on the product, and I'm willing to compromise to reach a deal. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,175,000. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While the offer is lower than Round 1, it's still too high.  It's worth continuing to negotiate and try to get the price closer to Bob's desired price."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $1,175,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $1,100,000 is still a bit lower than my target, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $1,150,000. This is a fair price that I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's a good compromise for both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000.

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While it's lower than her initial offers, it's still above Bob's ideal price.  It makes sense to keep negotiating and see if he can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,150,000.  I'm willing to go up to $1,125,000, which is a significant compromise from my last offer.  I hope we can reach a deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 1125000}

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $1,125,000, but I'd like to add a small premium to account for the value I've added to the product. I'm thinking of a price of $1,150,000, but I'm willing to meet you at $1,130,000. This is a fair price that I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's a good compromise for both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,130,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,130,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob should accept Alice's offer. While it's still above his ideal price, it's a significant improvement over previous offers and within his budget.  Continuing to negotiate might result in a lower price, but there's a risk that Alice will walk away or make a counter-offer that's higher than his budget.  It's better to lock in this price, especially since he has the option of purchasing from John if he wants to save even more money."
