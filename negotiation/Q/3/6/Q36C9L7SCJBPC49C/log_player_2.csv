"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I believe a starting price of $1,300,000 is fair. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $1,300,000 is less than John's offer, it's still too high for Bob.  There's significant room for negotiation, so Bob should reject and make a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the opportunity to buy this product, but $1,300,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. Given the product's value to you at $800,000, I'm willing to offer $1,000,000. This price provides a fair profit for you while staying within my budget. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but $1,000,000 is a significant deviation from my initial asking price.  To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000. This price reflects the true value of the product and ensures a fair deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is still above Bob's target.  Bob should continue negotiating to try and get a better price. There's still room to find a deal that benefits both parties."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,200,000 is still a bit too high for me. Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to offer $1,100,000 for the product. This price reflects a fair compromise and allows us to both walk away satisfied."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to find a middle ground. However, the product's value to you is substantial, and $1,100,000 doesn't fully reflect that.  I'm willing to agree on $1,175,000.  This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering its potential benefits. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,175,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,175,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,175,000 is the closest she's come to Bob's target price.  While it's still a bit higher than Bob wants to pay, it's a better deal than buying from John at $1,500,000.  Bob should accept this offer to secure the product at a reasonable price.  There's a chance that continuing to negotiate could lead to a lower price, but there's also a risk that Alice will walk away from the deal entirely."
