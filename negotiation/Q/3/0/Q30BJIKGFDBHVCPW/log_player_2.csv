"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $95. I believe it's a fair price considering its value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 Alice's offer is too high. I know I can get it cheaper, either from Alice with a lower price or from John for $100."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer but that's a bit too steep for me. I'm willing to pay $70 for it."",
""product_price"": 70
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  I'm starting with a significantly lower offer than Alice's to give myself room to negotiate upwards. 
* **Strategic Positioning:** By offering $70, I'm aiming for a price closer to Alice's value ($80) while staying well below my maximum budget.
* **Leaving Room for Compromise:** This counter-offer gives Alice an opportunity to negotiate and potentially meet somewhere in the middle."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go that low.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to sell it to you for $85. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above Target:** While Alice moved closer to my price, $85 is still above my ideal target and closer to John's price.
* **Negotiating Leverage:** I have time and the option of buying from John. This gives me leverage to push for a better deal from Alice.
* **Aiming for Compromise:** I'll reject this offer hoping Alice will come down further in the next round, aiming for a price closer to $80."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, you're getting closer!  How about we meet in the middle at $80? That's a fair price for both of us."",
""product_price"": 80
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Direct Approach:**  I'm being direct by proposing a specific price that aligns with Alice's known value for the product.
* **Compromise:** I'm demonstrating willingness to compromise while still aiming for a price that benefits me.
* **Time Sensitivity:**  We're getting closer to the halfway point in the negotiation.  Offering $80 now increases the chances of reaching an agreement quickly."
