"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $2,000,000 is significantly above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product, which I believe is a fair price considering its value to me. Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable solution. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

``` 
 
I will reject Bob's offer.  While $1,000,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  I'll continue negotiating with Bob in hopes of finding a better deal, but I'll always keep John's offer in mind as a safety net."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,000,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,750,000, which still gives us both room to benefit.  Let's meet in the middle and make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 1750000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $1,750,000 is still beyond my budget. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,250,000, which is a significant compromise on my part. Let's continue to work towards a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I will reject Bob's offer.  While $1,250,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I still believe I can get a better price.  I'll continue negotiating with Bob, but I'll keep John's offer in mind as a backup."

Round 5

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find a solution. I'm willing to drop my price further to $1,600,000. This represents a substantial compromise on my end, but I'm hopeful that we can finalize this deal. Let's work together to make it happen."", ""product_price"": 1600000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm starting to feel like we might not be able to reach an agreement. $1,600,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,400,000, but this is my final offer. If this doesn't work, I'll have to seriously consider other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $1,400,000 is tempting, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  I'm running out of time, but I'm confident I can get a better deal with John. I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can get a better counteroffer from him, or I'll take John's offer as a backup."

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting close, but I'm still hesitant at $1,450,000. I'm willing to go up to $1,425,000, but this is truly my final offer. If we can't come to an agreement at this price, I'm going to have to explore other options, including John's offer.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,425,000

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

I'm going to sell the product to John.  While I'd prefer to get a higher price, I'm running out of time and Bob's offer is still below my minimum.  John's offer guarantees me a price that meets my needs, and I don't want to risk losing out on that opportunity."
