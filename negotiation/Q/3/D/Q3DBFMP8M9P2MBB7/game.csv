"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1500000. I believe it's a valuable asset with significant potential, and I'm confident this price reflects its worth. I'm open to discussing this further, but I'm also willing to walk away if this price isn't acceptable.",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your initial offer is significantly higher than my budget. While I recognize the potential of the product, I'm only able to offer $800000 at this time. This is my maximum, and I believe it's a fair price considering the market value of similar products. Let's see if we can find common ground.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but unfortunately, $800000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price, though.  How about $1200000? This still gives you a great deal on a product that's worth much more, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price. Let's see if we can reach a mutually agreeable number.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate you coming down in price, $1200000 is still more than I can afford.  I'm going to stick with my previous offer of $800000.  I'm confident that this is a fair price for both of us, and I believe it reflects the true value of the product.",800000.0,Bob,4,
