Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but unfortunately, $800000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price, though.  How about $1200000? This still gives you a great deal on a product that's worth much more, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price. Let's see if we can reach a mutually agreeable number.

Alice's counteroffer is still too high.  I'm going to counteroffer again and try to close the gap."
