"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $15,000 is way too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I need a price that's more realistic.  Would you consider $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $6,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you the product for $12,000, which is a fair price considering its value to you. However, I'm open to negotiating further if you're willing to meet me in the middle.",12000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, Bob, but I'm still a bit below my target. I'm willing to consider $10,000, which is a bit closer to my minimum price, but I'm still open to negotiation.",10000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand, Alice.  I'm trying to make this work as well.  How about we settle at $8,500? That's a fair compromise, and it would allow me to get the product from you.",8500.0,Bob,6,
