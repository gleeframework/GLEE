,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the offer, but I'm not sure I can justify the price. I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. Can you consider meeting me in the middle?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your perspective, but $12,000 is significantly less than what I can accept. Let's meet closer to the middle. How about $18,000? This reflects the true value of the product.",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $18,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I was thinking more along the lines of $14,000. Can we meet in the middle again?",14000.0,Bob,4,
