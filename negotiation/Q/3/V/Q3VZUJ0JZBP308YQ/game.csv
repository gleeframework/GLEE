"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product, $12,000 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it. Let's see if we can find common ground.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $9,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can do $11,000, which is a 20% discount from my initial offer. I'm confident we can meet in the middle.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $11,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,500, which is a fair price for both of us.  Let's make this deal happen.",10500.0,Bob,4,

"I can see you're serious about this product, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I can do $11,250, which is a 5% discount from my last offer. This is as low as I can go.",11250.0,Alice,5,
