"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing product, and I think it's worth discussing a price of $12,000. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better offer anywhere else. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save money. Alice's initial offer of $12,000 is above his maximum budget. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product, $12,000 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $9,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can do $11,000, which is a 20% discount from my initial offer. I'm confident we can meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer of $11,000 is lower than her initial offer, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $10,000. There's still room for negotiation, and he can try to get a lower price before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $11,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,500, which is a fair price for both of us.  Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're serious about this product, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I can do $11,250, which is a 5% discount from my last offer. This is as low as I can go. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $11,250 is still above Bob's budget of $10,000. While he could continue negotiating, the risk of not reaching an agreement within the 10 rounds is increasing. At this point, it's more advantageous for Bob to buy the product from John for $10,000, ensuring he gets the product within his budget."
