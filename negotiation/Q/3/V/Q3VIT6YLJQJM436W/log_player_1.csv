Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the product for $14,000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value. Let me know if you're interested."", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to $15,000 as possible.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $12,000.
* **Alternative Buyer:** Alice has a guaranteed sale at $15,000 to John.

Offering the product at $14,000 creates a potential win-win:

* **Bob:** Gets the product for $2,000 less than his valuation.
* **Alice:** Earns $1,000 more than selling to John.

This strategy aims to secure the best possible outcome for Alice while leaving room for negotiation."
