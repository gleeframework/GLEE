"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product I think you'd be interested in. I'm asking for $95 for it, what do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

The product is worth $100 to you, and Alice is asking for $95. This is a decent price, but you can try to do better. Since you have the option of buying from John for $100, it makes sense to try and negotiate a lower price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested but $95 is a bit steep for me. How about $85? "", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go that low.  How about we split the difference and settle on $90?  I think that's fair to both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer of $90 is still within your budget.** You are willing to pay up to $100, so $90 is a good price.
* **You've already rejected a lower offer from Alice.**  This suggests you're not likely to get a better deal from her.
* **Buying from John for $100 would be more expensive.** It's always better to save money if possible.

Therefore, accepting Alice's offer of $90 is the best option in this situation."
