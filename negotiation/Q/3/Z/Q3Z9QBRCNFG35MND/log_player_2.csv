"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product. I think it's worth $150, but I'm open to negotiation.  Would you be interested in buying it for $130? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $130 is a good price, it's worth seeing if Alice is willing to go lower.  There are still 9 rounds left, so there's room to negotiate further."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but I'm only willing to pay $120 for it right now.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a lower counteroffer to see how far Alice is willing to go. I'm still within my budget and giving Alice room to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my asking price. How about $125? I'm confident this product will be worth it to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to my counteroffer, but there's still room for further negotiation. I'm confident I can get the price down a bit more. There are still 7 rounds left to explore."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $125 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $122.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 122}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly, demonstrating that I'm serious about buying but still trying to get the price down. This small increment might encourage Alice to close the deal."
