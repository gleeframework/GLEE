"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,000,000. This is ambitious, but it allows for room to negotiate if Bob is interested.  I want to see if he's truly interested in this product and what kind of budget he's working with."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $900,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  I believe I can still get closer to my ideal price with further negotiation. I'm going to try to push for something a bit closer to my initial asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $950,000. This is a compromise, showing willingness to negotiate, but still keeps me closer to my desired value.  We're getting closer, and hopefully, Bob will see the value in a deal at this price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I'd ideally like to get closer to $1,000,000,  $975,000 is a good price and significantly higher than my minimum of $800,000.  It's also very close to my last counteroffer, and I don't want to risk him backing out completely or losing too much time in further negotiation."
