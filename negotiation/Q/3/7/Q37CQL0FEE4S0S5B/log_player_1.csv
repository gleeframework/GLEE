Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is still a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $9,250? It's a fair price considering the value of the product for you."", ""product_price"": 9250}

I'm accepting Bob's offer of $9,000. This is a good deal for me as it's above my minimum price of $8,000 and it's likely that Bob won't offer more."
