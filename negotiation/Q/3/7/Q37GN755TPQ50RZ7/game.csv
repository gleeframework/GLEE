"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire this valuable item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a very competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,200,000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product, which is my maximum limit.  This would be a fair deal for both of us, as it allows you to sell the product while still exceeding your minimum price.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your honesty about your budget. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,150,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you and my minimum price. I hope we can come to an agreement.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
