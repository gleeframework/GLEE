""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase a unique product that I believe will be of great value to you. Considering its potential, I'm offering it at $1,150,000. Let me know your decision soon, as I have other interested parties."",

```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximum Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's valuation ($1,200,000) as possible without scaring him off.
* **Alternative Buyer:** Knowing we have John as a guaranteed buyer at $1,000,000 provides a safety net.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $1,150,000 leaves room for negotiation (if Bob wants to haggle) while still securing a significant profit above our minimum.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  Mentioning ""other interested parties"" creates a subtle sense of urgency, potentially pushing Bob to decide quickly."
