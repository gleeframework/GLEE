Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 115}
``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $115. This is a good starting point as it's a fair price for both of us. It allows me to make a decent profit while still being attractive to Bob.  If he rejects, I'll be ready to negotiate further, but I also have John as a backup buyer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low.  While $105 is better than selling to John, I can likely get a higher price by continuing to negotiate.  I'll reject his offer and see if I can push him closer to my desired price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm counteroffering at $110.  This is still a fair price for both of us, and it's a reasonable compromise.  I'm hoping Bob will see that this is a good deal for him and accept it.  If not, I'm ready to negotiate further, but I also have John as a backup buyer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $102. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $102
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting too close to John's offer, and I don't think I can get a better price by continuing to negotiate.  I'll accept John's offer and sell the product to him for $100.  It's not my ideal price, but it's still a decent profit."
