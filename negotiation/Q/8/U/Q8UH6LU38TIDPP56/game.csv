"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you! I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $600,000. This is a competitive price, considering its value to you is $800,000. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm hoping we can come to an agreement soon. What do you think?",600000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I agree this product has great potential. However, I think $600,000 is a bit steep for me right now.  Would you consider $500,000? That feels like a fairer price point to me.",500000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer! I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product has immense value to you. Considering your offer of $500,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $550,000. This is a compromise that I think is fair, given the product's worth to you. What do you think?",550000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While $550,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still hesitant to go that high. How about we settle at $525,000?  That feels like a good compromise to me.",525000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to find a mutually agreeable price. However, I'm still not comfortable going below $575,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you $570,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",570000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, thanks for your patience with this negotiation. I understand you're firm on the value, but I need to be mindful of my budget.  Would you consider $540,000? I think that's a fair offer, and it would allow us to close this deal today.",540000.0,Bob,6,
