"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,250,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and the significant benefits it offers."",
""product_price"": 2250000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm beginning with a strong offer significantly above both my minimum ($1,500,000) and Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000). This provides room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest level. 
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes the product's ""potential"" and ""significant benefits"" to justify the high price, even though I haven't revealed specifics about those benefits yet.
* **Alternative Option:** I'm keeping in mind that I have a guaranteed offer from John at $1,500,000. This gives me leverage and a safety net if negotiations with Bob don't progress favorably."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. That price is a bit high for me right now. I'm willing to offer $800,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob's offer of $800,000 is significantly below my minimum of $1,500,000.  It's clear we have a wide gap to bridge. I'm confident I can get a better deal, even if it means walking away from Bob and selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 is significantly below its true market value. To be frank, I have another buyer interested at a much higher price. However, I value our discussion and believe this product can be a real asset to you. I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This is my final offer for today. Let me know if you're interested."",
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:** I'm rejecting Bob's low offer but signaling a willingness to negotiate by significantly decreasing my initial price. 
* **Creating Urgency:**  I'm introducing the idea of another buyer (""John"" in disguise) to create a sense of competition and urgency for Bob to make a better offer.
* **""Final Offer"" Tactic:**  By stating this is my ""final offer for today,"" I'm aiming to prompt a more serious response from Bob in the next round. 
* **Leaving Room to Negotiate:**  While I've decreased my asking price, I'm still leaving room to negotiate further, as long as Bob's offer moves considerably closer to my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the product's value, but I need a price that works for me. I can do $1,100,000.  Let me know if that's possible. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too Low:** While Bob's offer has increased, $1,100,000 is still considerably below my $1,500,000 minimum. 
* **Negotiation Progress:**  Bob's counteroffers are getting closer to a reasonable range.  This suggests he's willing to pay more than his initial low offer.
* **Leverage:**  I still have the guaranteed offer from John, which allows me to confidently reject this offer and aim for a better deal in the remaining rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up on the price. To be completely transparent, my absolute minimum for this product is $1,500,000.  That's already a significant discount from what I've been offered elsewhere. If you're serious about acquiring it, I need you to meet me at this price."",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Revealing My Minimum (Strategically):**  I've decided to reveal my minimum price to Bob. By being transparent and emphasizing this is my absolute lowest, I'm hoping to encourage him to make a serious move. 
* **Justification:** I'm reiterating the strong outside interest (""offered elsewhere"") to reinforce the product's value and the attractiveness of my offer.
* **Direct Approach:** By directly stating this is my bottom line, I'm putting the decision in Bob's hands. This could encourage him to close the deal or reveal his true willingness to pay. 
* **Time Constraint:**  With five rounds remaining, I need to push Bob closer to my minimum to avoid potentially settling for John's offer if the negotiation stalls."
