Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 is significantly below its true market value. To be frank, I have another buyer interested at a much higher price. However, I value our discussion and believe this product can be a real asset to you. I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This is my final offer for today. Let me know if you're interested.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you coming up on the price. To be completely transparent, my absolute minimum for this product is $1,500,000.  That's already a significant discount from what I've been offered elsewhere. If you're serious about acquiring it, I need you to meet me at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**  While Alice has come down significantly, her ""absolute minimum"" is still higher than John's offer. It makes no financial sense to pay more than you need to. You can save $500,000 by going with John."
