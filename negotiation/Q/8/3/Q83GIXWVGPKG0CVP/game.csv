"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000.  It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $1,200,000.  Let me know your thoughts!",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I don't think I can go any higher than that.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,200,000 simply isn't enough for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,300,000?  It's a fair price for both of us, and allows us to close this deal.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to go up to $1,250,000, but no higher. Can you meet me at that price?",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,250,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This is a fair price that gives you a significant value for the product and allows me to make a profit. Let's finalize this deal.",1350000.0,Alice,5,
