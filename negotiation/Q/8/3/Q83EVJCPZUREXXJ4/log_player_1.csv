Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

I'm starting with my desired price of $10,000. This is the maximum value I'm willing to accept for the product, as I can sell it to John for that amount. I'm hoping Bob will be willing to pay this price, but I'm prepared to negotiate if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $8,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than my minimum value of $10,000. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

I'm offering to sell the product to Bob for $9,000. This is a compromise that is closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum value. I believe this price is fair, considering the value of the product for both of us."
