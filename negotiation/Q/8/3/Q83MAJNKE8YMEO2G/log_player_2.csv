"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product at a special price of $120. It's a great opportunity to get a fantastic deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json

Alice's offer of $120 is significantly higher than both your budget and what John is offering. It makes the most sense to go directly to John and get the best price."
