"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that starting price is way too high for me.  This product would be valuable to me, but I need to get it within a reasonable budget.  Would you consider a price closer to $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counter-offer.  While $800,000 is too low for me to consider, I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000. This product truly is unique and valuable, as I'm sure you can see.",2000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand the product's value, but we're still quite far apart. To be frank, I'm only comfortable going as high as $1,200,000.  Let me know if that works for you.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  Let's split the difference - $1,600,000 and we have a deal.  This is my final offer.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
