"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $9,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $6,000 is significantly below what I need to sell.  I'm willing to come down to $8,500, which is still a great deal for you.  Let's make this work.",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  While $8,500 is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $7,000. Would you be willing to meet in the middle?",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, and I am too.  How about we split the difference and go with $7,500?  This is a fair compromise that gets us both closer to our desired price.",7500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're right, we both deserve a fair deal. Let's settle this at $7,250 and we can both walk away happy.",7250.0,Bob,6,
