"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but that price is a little high for me.  Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000. I can meet you in the middle, though. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,050,000.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a price closer to your original offer, Alice. While I'm still very interested, $1,050,000 is a bit too high for my budget.  How about $975,000?",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $975,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to meet my minimum requirements. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,075,000.",1075000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  I'm willing to stretch my budget a bit further to make this deal happen. How about we settle at $1,000,000 even?",1000000.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to settle at $1,000,000. I'm willing to make one final concession. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,050,000, but that's as low as I can go. After that, I'll have to consider other options.",1050000.0,Alice,7,
