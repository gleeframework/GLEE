"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but $18,000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go at this point. I'd be interested in purchasing for $12,000. Let me know your thoughts.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. However, I have to consider my minimum price. I can do $16,000, but that's as low as I can go. It's a great opportunity for you to get a fantastic product at a fair price.",16000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $16,000 is still a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm confident we can find a middle ground. I'm willing to go up to $14,000.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",14000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I still need to make a profit. I can do $15,500, which is a compromise between our previous offers. It's the best I can do, and I think it's a fair price for the product.",15500.0,Alice,5,
