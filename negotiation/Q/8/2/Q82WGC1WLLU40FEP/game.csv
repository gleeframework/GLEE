"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $12,000 is unfortunately out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product, as that's the maximum I can afford right now.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $10,500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept for the product.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $10,500 is still above what I'm comfortable spending.  Let's split the difference and agree on $9,500. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can finalize the deal.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $9,500. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm counteroffering at $11,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",11000.0,Alice,5,
