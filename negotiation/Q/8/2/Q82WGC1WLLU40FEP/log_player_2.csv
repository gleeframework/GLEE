Bob should reject Alice's offer. It's far above his budget, and he has a better option with John."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $10,500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept for the product.

While $10,500 is better than Alice's initial offer, it's still more than Bob is willing to pay. He's better off rejecting this offer and continuing to negotiate or buying from John."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $9,500. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm counteroffering at $11,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.

Bob should choose to buy from John. While Alice has come down from her initial offer, $11,000 is still higher than what Bob is willing to pay. John is offering a lower price, making him the better option for Bob."
