"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $600,000 for this product. Let me know what you think.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm afraid $600,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $900,000. This is my final offer for now, and I'm excited to see if we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $900,000 is still a bit above my budget. How about we settle at $700,000? This offer is a good compromise, and I'm hopeful we can make a deal.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go below $800,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and meet you at $750,000. This is my last offer, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal.",750000.0,Alice,5,
