Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly.  I believe it's a great deal at $14,500. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 14500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, your goal is to see if Bob will pay more.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product slightly below your minimum acceptable price ($15,000) creates a sense of urgency and potential bargain for Bob.
* **Open Negotiation:** The message leaves room for Bob to counter-offer, potentially allowing you to secure an even higher price. 

By starting high but leaving room for negotiation, you maximize your chances of getting the best possible price from either Bob or John."
