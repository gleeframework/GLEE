You can likely get a better price than $10,000.  It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

I'm offering $9,000. This is a good compromise - it's still more than Alice's ideal price, but significantly less than the $10,000 she's offering."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500

While $10,500 is a bit higher than my ideal, it's still a better deal than buying from John. It's worth it to avoid the potential hassle of further negotiations and ensure I get the product."
