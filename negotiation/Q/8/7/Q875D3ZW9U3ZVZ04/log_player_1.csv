"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'll be interested in. I'm asking for $140 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's slightly higher than your minimum desired price, but leaves room for negotiation. Since you know the product is worth more to Bob, you can likely secure a higher price if he's willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I believe I can offer you $130 for the product. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is close to your minimum, you know the product is worth more to him. You can likely get a higher price by rejecting his offer and making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping for a bit more. How about $135? This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'd be happy to finalize the deal."", ""product_price"": 135}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. Considering my budget, I am willing to offer $132 for the product. I hope this meets your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $132. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $132
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to your desired price, but you can still try to push for a bit more.  You've already rejected his previous offer, and he seems willing to negotiate. You might be able to secure a higher price by rejecting his offer and making a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, your offer is getting closer, but I'm still holding out for a little more.  How about we split the difference and go with $133?  It's a fair price for both of us, and we can finalize the deal."", ""product_price"": 133}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Based on my budget, I am comfortable offering $131 for the product. I hope this proposal works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $131. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $131
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This is a tough choice, as you are close to your minimum price of $120 and you only have 4 rounds left. While you could try to counteroffer and push for more, there is no guarantee that Bob will accept, and you risk losing the sale entirely. 

Accepting Bob's offer at $131 ensures you get a decent profit and avoids the risk of ending up with nothing."
