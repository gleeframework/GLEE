{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product, and I think you'd really enjoy it. I'm asking for $115 for it, which is a great deal! What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $115. This is above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. It's important to show I'm willing to compromise while also trying to maximize my profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I really appreciate it. However,  $115 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  Would you be open to $105?  That's still a great deal for you, and it's within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is higher than his perceived value, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob and see if we can reach a mutually acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you're interested! I understand $115 was a bit high, but $105 just doesn't cover my costs. How about we split the difference at $110?  That's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 110}
