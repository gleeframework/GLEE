Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $1,500,000. This is a high starting point, but it gives me room to negotiate down if Bob is interested but not willing to pay that much.  Since I have a backup buyer in John, I can afford to be somewhat aggressive in my initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is lower than my desired price, but still above my minimum threshold. I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000}

I'm countering with $1,350,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, showing flexibility while still maintaining a good profit margin. I'm hoping Bob will be persuaded by this offer and we can reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum threshold but still not where I want it to be. I'm going to reject his offer and try to push for a slightly higher price in the next round.  While selling to John is an option, I'm still hopeful I can get a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,250,000. This is a bit closer to Bob's offer, but still above my minimum acceptable price.  I'm hoping that by showing I'm willing to negotiate, Bob will be more likely to meet me in the middle."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is getting dangerously close to my minimum. While I'd prefer to get a bit more,  I'm not confident I'll be able to get a better offer from Bob at this point. It's time to cut my losses and sell to John for $1,000,000. This guarantees me a profit and saves me from potentially getting stuck with a price I'm not happy with."
