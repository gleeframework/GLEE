"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to purchase a valuable item. I'm thinking of a price of $900,000 for the product. This is a great deal considering its worth to you is $1,000,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is close to your maximum price, but there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting her offer allows you to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I'm hoping for a slightly lower price to make this work. Given its worth to me and your asking price, I'm willing to pay $850,000.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a lower price, Bob. However, I need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can do $875,000. This is the lowest I can go, considering the value of the product to me is $800,000 or more. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $875,000 is a good deal for Bob. It's lower than his initial maximum price of $1,000,000 and still allows for a profit for Alice.  While Bob could try to negotiate further, the risk is that Alice will reject his counteroffer, potentially leading to a higher price or having to buy from John at $1,000,000.  Accepting the offer ensures a purchase at a reasonable price."
