"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I don't want to go any higher than that. Can you consider my counteroffer?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $900,000 is still a bit lower than what I'm hoping for. How about we split the difference and go with $950,000? It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to earn a bit more than your initial offer.  Let me know your thoughts.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'll offer $925,000. I think this is a fair price for both of us, and I'm willing to compromise to get the deal done.",925000.0,Bob,4,
