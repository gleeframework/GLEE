"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $17,000. I know it's a great deal for you, as it's worth $15,000 to you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know what you think!",17000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $17,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for it. Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is significantly lower than what I'm willing to accept. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to at least get $15,000 for this product. Let's find a middle ground, how about $14,000? This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product for both of us.",14000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand you're looking for a fair price. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000? That's a significant increase from my initial offer and would save me some money compared to John's offer.",13000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  $13,000 is still a bit too low for me. While I'm willing to negotiate, I can't go any lower than $14,000. This price is fair considering the value of the product and it's still less than what John is offering. I hope you'll reconsider and we can reach an agreement.",14000.0,Alice,5,
