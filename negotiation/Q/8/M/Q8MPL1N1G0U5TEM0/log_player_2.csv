# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to find a compromise, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $975,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. I'll offer it to you for $1,025,000. This is the best I can do, and I hope you'll consider it.

**Reasoning:**  Alice is consistently meeting in the middle, but that still keeps the price above your absolute limit from John. It's unlikely Alice will come down enough to make it worth continuing the negotiation. You can get the product for $1,000,000 from John, which is your maximum budget."
