"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be perfect for you and I'm willing to let it go for $20,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $20,000 is significantly higher than both your maximum budget ($12,000) and John's offer ($12,000).
* It's highly unlikely Alice will accept an offer as low as $12,000 immediately. 
* By rejecting and entering further negotiation rounds, you can try to get Alice's price closer to your desired range.
 
Let's see if we can negotiate a better price!"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is a bit steep for me.  This product would be very useful, but I'm working with a tighter budget. Would you consider $10,000?"", 
""product_price"": 10000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** We're starting significantly below our actual maximum ($12,000) to give ourselves room to negotiate upwards.
* **Polite but Firm:** The message is polite to maintain a positive negotiating environment, but also clearly states our budget constraints.
* **Gauging Alice's Flexibility:** This counteroffer will help us understand how flexible Alice is willing to be on the price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. While $10,000 is a bit too low for me to consider, I'm willing to negotiate. How about we meet in the middle at $17,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too High:** $17,000 is still significantly higher than both your budget and John's offer.
* **Alice is Negotiable:** Alice reducing her price shows she's willing to negotiate. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** We have room to go up from our initial offer, and hopefully, Alice will continue to come down.

Let's continue negotiating!"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving a bit on the price.  To be completely transparent, my absolute maximum is $12,000. If you're able to meet that price, I'm ready to close the deal. Otherwise, I might have to explore other options."", 
""product_price"": 12000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Constraint:** We're getting closer to the halfway point of the negotiation rounds.  It's a good time to be a little more assertive.
* **Transparency and Deadline:** By being transparent about our maximum budget and hinting at other options (John), we create a sense of urgency.
* **Final Offer (for now):** Presenting this as our ""best and final"" offer at this stage might encourage Alice to accept, especially if she's motivated to sell quickly."
