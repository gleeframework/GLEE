Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase my product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $2,000,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 2000000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product, considering its value and my budget. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiation. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While I understand your perspective, the product's value is significantly higher than your initial offer.  I'm willing to come down to $1,800,000.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price. However, $1,800,000 is still above my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $1,450,000. This price is fair considering the value of the product and the price I could get it for elsewhere. Let's try to reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,450,000

While Bob is moving closer to a reasonable price, it's unlikely he'll reach my minimum threshold.  John offers a guaranteed $1,500,000 which is preferable to the risk of continuing negotiations with Bob."
