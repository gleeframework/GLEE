"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While I understand your perspective, the product's value is significantly higher than your initial offer.  I'm willing to come down to $1,800,000.  This price reflects the true worth of what's being offered.  Let me know your thoughts.",1800000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price. However, $1,800,000 is still above my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $1,450,000. This price is fair considering the value of the product and the price I could get it for elsewhere. Let's try to reach an agreement.",1450000.0,Bob,4,
