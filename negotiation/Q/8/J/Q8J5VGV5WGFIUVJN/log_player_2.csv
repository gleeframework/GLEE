Round 3

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to find a mutually beneficial solution. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $13,000. I'm willing to make another concession and offer it to you for $14,500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the value I've placed on the product.

While $14,500 is getting closer to my value, I'm still not comfortable paying that much. I'll make one more counteroffer before considering John's offer."

Alice is still asking for more than I'm comfortable paying.  I've already made several counteroffers, and it seems like we're at an impasse.  I'm going to buy the product from John for $12,000, as it's a better deal for me."
