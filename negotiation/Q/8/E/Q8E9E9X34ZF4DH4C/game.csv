"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am only able to pay up to $8,000 for it. Could we possibly meet in the middle?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $8,000 is just too low for me.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $9,000.  It's a fair compromise that allows both of us to get a good deal. ",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $9,000 is closer to my budget, I still can't commit to that price. Would it be possible to come down to $8,500?",8500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I understand you're working within a budget.  While $8,500 is tempting, I'm still not quite there. How about we meet at $8,800? It's a small step closer to your offer, and it reflects the value this product will bring to your business. What do you think?",8800.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for your continued efforts to accommodate my budget. I appreciate the reduction to $8,800. However, I'm still unable to reach that price point. Would it be possible for us to agree on $8,700?",8700.0,Bob,6,
