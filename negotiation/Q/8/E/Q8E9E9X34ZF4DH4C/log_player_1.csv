"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price slightly lower than my minimum acceptable price ($10,000) to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Tone:** Using a friendly tone to encourage Bob to consider the offer.
* **Value Proposition:**  Mentioning the value of the product to pique Bob's interest. 

**Strategy:**

I'm aiming for a quick close, but if Bob rejects, I'll adjust my offer based on his counteroffer and the number of rounds remaining. I'll keep the option of selling to John open throughout the negotiation, ensuring I get at least my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am only able to pay up to $8,000 for it. Could we possibly meet in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  $8,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.  
* **Negotiation Potential:** There's still room for negotiation.  Even though Bob is unwilling to meet me halfway, there's a chance we can find a price that works for both of us. 
* **Maintaining Options:** I want to explore more options before resorting to selling to John. 

**Next Steps:**

* I'll counter with a price that's still higher than Bob's offer but closer to his price point to encourage further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $8,000 is just too low for me.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $9,000.  It's a fair compromise that allows both of us to get a good deal. "", ""product_price"": 9000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm offering a price that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer, showing willingness to compromise. 
* **Fairness:** I'm framing the counteroffer as a fair compromise, appealing to Bob's sense of reason.
* **Maintaining Value:** While lower than my initial offer,  $9,000 is still significantly higher than Bob's offer, ensuring I don't lose too much value.

**Strategy:**

* I'm aiming to find a middle ground. If Bob accepts, I get a decent price. If he rejects, I have more room to maneuver in the remaining rounds.
* I'm keeping the option of selling to John open, ensuring I have a backup plan if the negotiation falls through."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $9,000 is closer to my budget, I still can't commit to that price. Would it be possible to come down to $8,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too Low:** While $8,500 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still not a deal I'm willing to accept immediately. I need to maintain some leverage and see if I can push for a higher price.
* **Room for Negotiation:** We're getting closer to a potential deal, but there's still room to negotiate. I'm hoping to find a price somewhere in the middle.
* **Maintaining Options:** Selling to John for $10,000 is still a viable option, but I want to see if I can close a deal with Bob first.

**Next Steps:**

* I'll counter with a price that's slightly higher than Bob's offer, aiming for a price around $8,800. I'll focus on highlighting the value of the product to justify my counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I understand you're working within a budget.  While $8,500 is tempting, I'm still not quite there. How about we meet at $8,800? It's a small step closer to your offer, and it reflects the value this product will bring to your business. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8800}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Increment:**  I'm making a small increase from Bob's offer, showing a willingness to compromise but also maintaining my value.
* **Focus on Value:** I'm emphasizing the value the product will bring to Bob's business to justify the price.
* **Open to Discussion:**  I'm using a question to encourage further negotiation and keep the conversation going.

**Strategy:**

* I'm hoping to find a price point that's acceptable to both of us, while still maximizing my profit.
* I'm keeping in mind that I have the option to sell to John, giving me a safety net if negotiations fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your continued efforts to accommodate my budget. I appreciate the reduction to $8,800. However, I'm still unable to reach that price point. Would it be possible for us to agree on $8,700? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,700. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,700
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:**  $8,700 is only $300 away from my minimum acceptable price of $8,000. I'm starting to feel the pressure of the limited rounds.
* **Progress Made:** We've made significant progress in the negotiations, and Bob is clearly willing to negotiate. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** While selling to John would give me a better price, there's a risk that I might not get a better offer from Bob in the remaining rounds.

**Strategy:**

* Accepting the offer now secures a deal and avoids the risk of further negotiations failing. 
* I'm confident that I can make up for the slight price difference by focusing on my other business endeavors."
