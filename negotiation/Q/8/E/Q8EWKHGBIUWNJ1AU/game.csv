"Hello Bob, I'm excited to be offering you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product. Given its value and potential, I'm confident it will be a wise investment for you.

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate the opportunity to purchase this product, but $2,250,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to offer $1,750,000 for it.  It's a fair price considering the value we both see in the product. Let's see if we can work something out.",1750000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective, but I'm still confident in the value this product brings. Let's meet in the middle a bit - how about $2,000,000?",2000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $2,000,000 is still outside of my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $1,850,000, which is a significant amount for me.  This demonstrates my seriousness about acquiring this product.  Let's work together to find a solution that benefits us both.",1850000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I'm aiming for a higher number, I'm willing to consider $1,925,000 to find a mutually beneficial agreement. This offer reflects the product's true worth. What do you say?",1925000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer! While I appreciate the gesture, $1,925,000 is still a bit beyond my reach. I'm willing to offer $1,875,000, which is a substantial amount for me and demonstrates my commitment to acquiring this product. Let's work together to bridge the gap and reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1875000.0,Bob,6,
