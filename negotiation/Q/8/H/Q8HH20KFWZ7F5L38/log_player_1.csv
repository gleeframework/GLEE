"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you. I'm confident we can reach an agreement that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $850,000 is better than John's offer of $800,000, I'm aiming for a higher price.  I believe I can still negotiate with Bob and get closer to my desired price point.  Rejecting his offer keeps the negotiation open and allows me to make a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, $850,000 doesn't quite cover my costs. I'm willing to compromise and offer you the product for $900,000. This is still a great deal for you, considering the value it holds for your business. Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, Alice, but $900,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $875,000. I think this is a fair price considering the value the product will bring to my business. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $875,000 is tempting, I'm still aiming for a higher price. I'm confident that I can negotiate further with Bob and get closer to my target of $900,000 or higher. I have several rounds left, and I'm willing to keep negotiating to maximize my profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $875,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer the product for $887,500.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway again, Alice. However, $887,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $880,000, but that's as high as I can go. I hope we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $880,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $880,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $880,000 is very close to my counteroffer of $887,500.  At this point, with only 4 rounds remaining, I don't want to risk losing the deal.  It's a good price, exceeding John's offer by a significant margin.  Accepting Bob's offer ensures a profitable sale and minimizes the risk of further negotiation."
