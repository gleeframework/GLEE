Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm still not willing to go as low as $11,500. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $13,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value.

While Alice is coming closer to a reasonable price, it's unlikely she'll go much lower than $13,000. It's time to cut my losses and go with the guaranteed deal from John at $12,000."
