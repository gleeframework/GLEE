Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value to someone like you, I'm proposing a price of $925,000.  I believe this reflects a fair deal considering the significant return on investment you're likely to see."", 
""product_price"": 925000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's $1,000,000 valuation as possible. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $925,000 leaves some space for potential negotiation (if Bob tries to counter-offer) while still securing a significant profit. 
* **Highlight Value:** The message emphasizes the product's value specifically to Bob, justifying the high price.
* **Alternative Option:** Knowing John offers a safety net, Alice can be more confident in aiming high with Bob. 

By setting a high but justifiable price, Alice increases her chances of securing a deal that's significantly more profitable than her guaranteed alternative with John."
