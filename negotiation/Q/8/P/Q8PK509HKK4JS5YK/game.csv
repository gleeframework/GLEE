"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While I understand your perspective on the price, $1400000 is significantly below the value I've placed on it. Let's split the difference - I'm willing to come down to $1700000. This reflects a fair compromise, and I believe it's still a very attractive offer for you.",1700000.0,Alice,3,
