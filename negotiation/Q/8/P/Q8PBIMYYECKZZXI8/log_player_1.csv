Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'll find very valuable. I'm asking $120 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $120, which is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price ($80) but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Leaving room for counteroffers:**  $120 is lower than Bob's perceived value ($150), so he's likely to counteroffer. This allows me to potentially reach a mutually beneficial price.
* **Building rapport:** I'm using a friendly and open tone to start the conversation, which can make Bob more likely to engage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Potential for higher price:**  While $100 is a decent offer, it's still below my desired price point.  I believe I can likely get closer to my target by counter-offering.
* **Testing Bob's limits:**  Rejecting the offer allows me to gauge how much Bob is truly willing to pay. 
* **Opportunity to negotiate:**  Counter-offering gives me the opportunity to potentially secure a better price than $100, while still potentially reaching a deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. While I appreciate your interest, $100 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $110. This reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 110} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** My counteroffer is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer.  It shows flexibility while still aiming for a price closer to my desired value.
* **Reinforcing value:** I reiterate the value of the product to justify the price.
* **Positive framing:**  I emphasize a ""fair deal"" to encourage Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $105? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to target:** Bob's offer of $105 is only $5 away from my desired price point.  
* **Risk of losing deal:**  If I reject this offer, there's a risk Bob might walk away entirely.
* **Minimizing loss:**  While I'd prefer more, accepting the offer ensures I make a profit significantly higher than selling to John.  

Given the potential for a prolonged negotiation, the risk of Bob leaving, and the close proximity to my desired price, accepting the $105 offer seems like the most sensible choice."
