"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on this amazing product. I'm willing to offer it to you for $10,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $10,000 is a good deal, there's still room for negotiation.  He can try to get a lower price before committing."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $10,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at the moment.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a counteroffer that's closer to his maximum budget, but still leaves room for negotiation. This shows Alice he's serious about buying the product, but also that he's not going to overpay."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $9,500. I think this is a fair price considering the value the product can bring to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $9,500 is closer to Bob's budget, he can still do better. He's already shown Alice he's serious about buying the product but is willing to walk away if the price isn't right. There's still room to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $9,500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to go up to $9,000.  I think that's a fair compromise, considering the value of the product to both of us.  Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is sticking to his goal of getting the best possible deal. He's offering a slightly higher price than his previous counteroffer, but still well below Alice's current offer. This shows that he's trying to meet in the middle, while still protecting his budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your willingness to compromise, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not quite ready to accept $9,000 yet. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer the product to you for $9,250. I think this is a fair price considering the value the product can bring to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still very close to his budget limit, but he's not ready to give up. He's shown Alice he's willing to pay a fair price, but he's also shown that he's not desperate.  He can still try to negotiate a lower price before accepting."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I really appreciate your flexibility.  $9,250 is still a little higher than I'd like to go.  I'm going to offer $9,100 as a final compromise. I think this is a fair deal for both of us, and I'm confident this product will be a valuable asset to me.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 9100}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is nearing his budget limit, but he's making one final attempt to get a better price.  He's framing it as a fair deal for both parties, emphasizing the value he'll get out of the product. This could be persuasive enough for Alice to accept and close the deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your willingness to compromise, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not quite ready to accept $9,100 yet. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer the product to you for $9,200. I think this is a fair price considering the value the product can bring to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

At this point, Alice is being stubborn and refusing to budge on the price. Bob has already made a few compromises and is very close to his budget limit. It's clear that further negotiation might result in a higher price than Bob is willing to pay. To avoid overspending, Bob decides to choose the guaranteed option and buy the product from John for $8,000."
