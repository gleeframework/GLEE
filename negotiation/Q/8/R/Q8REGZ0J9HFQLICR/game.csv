"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,400,000. This is a great deal, considering its value to you is $1,200,000. What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, that price point is a little high for me. Would you consider $1,050,000?",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,050,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,300,000. This is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Thanks for the counter-offer, Alice. I appreciate you coming down. To be honest, $1,150,000 would be the highest I could go.  It's a great product, but I need to stay within my budget.",1150000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $1,150,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $1,250,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to me. What do you think?",1250000.0,Alice,5,
