"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product, but I believe we can come to an agreement closer to its true worth. How about $950,000? I hope this proposal is within your acceptable range.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $1,100,000?  This price reflects the product's true value and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's work together to find common ground.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your response, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Considering the product's value and the current market conditions, I propose a price of $1,050,000. This offers a fair compromise between the original asking price and the lower offer. I hope this suggestion is more in line with what you're considering.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
