Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $1,500,000 is way above my budget.  While I see the value in this product, I'm only able to offer $850,000 at this time.  Let's see if we can find some common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000

``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is moving closer to a reasonable price, we're still significantly below our minimum acceptable price.  It's unlikely Bob will drastically increase his offer in the remaining rounds to reach our $1,000,000 minimum. Selling to John guarantees us our desired profit with no further negotiation risk."
