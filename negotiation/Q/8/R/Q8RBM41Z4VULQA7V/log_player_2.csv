Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is significantly below its true value and my initial asking price. This product offers substantial returns, and I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you.  To move things along, I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This is my final offer for this round.

$1,350,000 is still too high.  I'll counteroffer again, but if Alice doesn't budge much more, I might just go with John."
