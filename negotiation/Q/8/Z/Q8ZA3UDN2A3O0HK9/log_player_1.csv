"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit high for me.  How about $9,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price.  $9,000 is still below my minimum, but it's a good starting point for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I'm willing to be flexible, $9,000 is still a bit low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,500? This would still be a great deal for you, as you value the product at $15,000."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet in the middle.  How about we try $9,750? I think that's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While $9,750 is closer to my minimum, I still believe I can get a better price. I'm going to try one more counteroffer to see if we can reach a deal before I consider selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $9,750 is still a little too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,000 to try and find a mutually agreeable price.  This leaves some room for negotiation, and would still be a great deal for you."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you're getting closer! I'm willing to increase my offer slightly to $9,850. That's a very fair offer considering we're both making a compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,850. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,850
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd still prefer a higher price, $9,850 is only slightly below my minimum of $8,000.  With only four rounds left, I don't want to risk losing the deal and having to sell to John for less. Accepting Bob's offer ensures I make a profit and avoid further negotiation."
