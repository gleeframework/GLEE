You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to inflate the product's value to you. While it might be worth $1,200,000 to you in the worst-case scenario (buying from John), you can do better. By rejecting her offer, you signal that her price is too high. This opens the door for further negotiation or sticking with your backup plan of buying from John."
