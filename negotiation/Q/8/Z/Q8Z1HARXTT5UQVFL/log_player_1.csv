Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm confident it will yield significant returns for you.  I'm willing to make a deal at $1,400,000.  Let me know if you're interested, as this offer is only valid for a limited time before I open it up to other potential buyers."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** While we know John will buy the product for $1,500,000, aiming for a higher price with Bob initially is ideal. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $1,400,000  creates a sense of urgency and exclusivity for Bob. This price is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($800,000) but still offers a significant discount compared to what John is willing to pay.
* **Negotiation Room:** The message leaves room for negotiation if Bob counters.  
* **Alternative Option:** By mentioning other potential buyers (John), we subtly emphasize the product's demand and the risk of missing out if Bob declines."
