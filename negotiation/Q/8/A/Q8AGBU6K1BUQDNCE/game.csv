"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  I'm very interested in this product, but $2000000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Would you be willing to consider a price of $1750000?  I believe this price reflects the value of the product while still allowing you a fair return.",1750000.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $1900000, but I'm still a bit higher than I'm willing to pay.  I'm prepared to offer $1800000 for the product.  This would be a fair deal for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement at this price.",1800000.0,Bob,4,
