Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find very valuable. I'm offering it to you for $110."", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** You know the product is worth $120 to Bob.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $80.
* **Maximizing Profit:**  Offering the product at $110 allows you to capture a significant portion of the value difference ($120 - $80 = $40) while still ensuring Bob sees a benefit in buying from you ($120 - $110 = $10 gain).

This strategy aims to strike a balance between a price Bob is likely to accept and a price that maximizes your profit."
