"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I believe would be a great fit for you. I'm asking for $12,000 for it, which is a fair price considering its value. Let me know what you think!",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Could you consider $8,500?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to be flexible. However, $8,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $10,250? This would still give you a good price, and it's a fair offer for me.",10250.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $10,250 is closer, but still a little high for me.  Would you consider $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob,  I see we're getting closer! While I appreciate your offer, $9,000 is still a bit low for me. To make this work, I'm willing to come down to $9,500.  This price is fair for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find this product very valuable.",9500.0,Alice,5,
