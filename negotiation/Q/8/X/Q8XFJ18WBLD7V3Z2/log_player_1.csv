Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really like it.  I'm asking $140 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $140, which is above Bob's perceived value of $120 but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Friendly Tone:**  I'm using a friendly tone to build rapport and potentially make Bob more likely to accept.
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffers:**  I'm leaving room for Bob to counteroffer, which is crucial for a successful negotiation.
* **Protecting My Minimum:** I'm making sure that my price is always above my minimum value of $150.

This strategy aims to maximize my earnings while also leaving room for Bob to feel like he got a good deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $140 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to come down to $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $100 is significantly lower than my minimum value of $150. Accepting his offer would result in a significant loss for me.  While I'm open to negotiation, I'm not willing to compromise that much. 

I'm going to counteroffer and try to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $100 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and I come down to $125?  This is a fair price that's still within my range."", ""product_price"": 125}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a compromise by meeting halfway between my previous offer ($140) and Bob's offer ($100). This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate.
* **Justification:** I'm providing a reason for my counteroffer by mentioning it's still within my range. This helps Bob understand why I can't go lower.
* **Maintaining Value:** $125 is still above my minimum value of $150, ensuring I don't lose money. 

This counteroffer aims to find a mutually agreeable price while still protecting my financial interests."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand, Alice.  $125 is closer, but I'm trying to stick to a tight budget. Could you do $110? That's a firm offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $110 is still below my minimum value of $150.  While I'm open to negotiation, I'm not willing to compromise that much.  

I've already made two counteroffers, and Bob seems to be digging in at a price that's too low for me.  It's clear that we're not going to find common ground. 

Selling to John for $150 is the best option, as it guarantees me my minimum value and avoids further negotiation."
