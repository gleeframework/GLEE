{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a valuable asset, and I believe this price reflects its worth. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $800,000, but leaves room for negotiation. It also demonstrates that I'm serious about selling to Bob, while still leaving some potential profit for him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. Given the product's value, I'm willing to pay $950,000.  This seems like a fair price for both of us.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum price, it's still below what I believe the product is worth. I'm willing to negotiate further to see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $950,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This price reflects the product's value while still giving you a significant discount from my initial offer. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, $1,050,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and allows for a comfortable profit for you.  Let's make this deal happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to $1,050,000, Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is still a good deal for me.  It's significantly higher than what John would pay and it seems like Bob is unlikely to go higher."
