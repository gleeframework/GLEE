"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. Given the product's value, I'm willing to pay $950,000.  This seems like a fair price for both of us.  What do you think?",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $950,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This price reflects the product's value while still giving you a significant discount from my initial offer. Let's meet in the middle.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, $1,050,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and allows for a comfortable profit for you.  Let's make this deal happen.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
