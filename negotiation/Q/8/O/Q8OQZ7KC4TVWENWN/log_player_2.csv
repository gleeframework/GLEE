# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe would be incredibly beneficial for you. Given its value, I'm offering it at a price of $1,100,000. I think this is a fair starting point for negotiations.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While I'm motivated to sell, $900,000 undervalues the product significantly.  Could you consider $1,050,000? This feels like a fair compromise.
