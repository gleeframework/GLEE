"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product but $1,100,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While I'm motivated to sell, $900,000 undervalues the product significantly.  Could you consider $1,050,000? This feels like a fair compromise.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
