Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point:

* **It's above your minimum:**  $12,000 is higher than your $8,000 minimum, ensuring you make a profit.
* **It's below Bob's maximum:**  $12,000 is lower than Bob's $15,000, giving him room to negotiate and feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **It leaves room for counteroffers:**  This approach allows for a back-and-forth, which is crucial for successful negotiation.

Remember, you can always adjust your strategy based on Bob's response. If he rejects, consider your options: 

* **Lower your price slightly:**  But not too much!
* **Make a counteroffer:**  This shows you're willing to negotiate.
* **Sell to John:**  If you feel you won't get a better offer, selling to John guarantees you your minimum."
