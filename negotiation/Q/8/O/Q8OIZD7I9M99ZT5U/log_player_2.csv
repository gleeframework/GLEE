"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. 
* Alice's offer of $140 is higher than Bob's maximum price of $150. 
*  It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price with Alice before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 130} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* Bob is trying to get the best price, so he's offering a price closer to his maximum value.
* A $130 offer is a reasonable starting point for negotiation. 
* This offer allows for some room to potentially reach a mutually agreeable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $132. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $132
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $132 is within Bob's budget and is closer to his target price than John's offer of $150.
* Accepting this offer allows Bob to save $18 compared to buying from John.
* While further negotiation might be possible, the risk of reaching a deal with Alice in the limited rounds is higher."
