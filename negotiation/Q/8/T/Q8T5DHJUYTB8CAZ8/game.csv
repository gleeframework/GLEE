"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a great opportunity for you to own this unique item. As we start our negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer Alice, but $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Considering the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $850,000. Let's see if we can find a meeting point there.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that the product's value to you justifies a higher price. Considering your offer of $850,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a counteroffer of $1,100,000. This price still leaves a significant margin for you to benefit from the product, while also recognizing the value it holds for you.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,100,000 is still too high for me.  Let's split the difference â€“ I'm happy to pay $950,000. This is a fair price that acknowledges the value to me while giving you a good profit.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $950,000 is a compromise for you, Bob, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. Considering your previous offers, I'm willing to make another counteroffer of $1,050,000. This price is closer to my initial offer, but still takes into account the value you place on the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to get closer to my target price.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm getting closer to your price, but $1,050,000 is still beyond my budget. I'm going to offer $975,000. This is a fair price that allows us both to get a good deal. What do you think?",975000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product at $975,000. Considering our previous conversations, I'm willing to make another counteroffer of $1,025,000. This price is still a bit higher than my initial offer, but I'm willing to compromise to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1025000.0,Alice,7,
