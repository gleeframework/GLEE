"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product for a price of $850,000.  This is a fair price considering its value to both of us. I believe this is a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. Let's see if we can make a deal.",850000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to be mindful of my budget.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget concerns, but $750,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $800,000? This is a fair price considering the product's value, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $800,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $775,000, which is the highest price I can afford. I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",775000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're making an effort to find a price that works for us both.  While $775,000 is closer to my desired price, I need to make sure I get a fair return on this product.  I'm willing to drop my price a little further, but how about $790,000?  This is a fair compromise that allows us both to get what we want.  Let's close this deal.",790000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $790,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to pay $780,000, which is the maximum I can afford. I hope we can find a price that works for both of us.",780000.0,Bob,6,
