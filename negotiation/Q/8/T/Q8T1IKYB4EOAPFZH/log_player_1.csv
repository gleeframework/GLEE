Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to be mindful of my budget.

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While I need to be mindful of closing a deal, $750,000 is too low for me, considering the product's value to both of us. I'll see if I can get closer to my desired price in the next round."

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $800,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $775,000, which is the highest price I can afford. I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob is getting closer to my price, $775,000 is still a bit too low.  I'm going to hold out for a better offer, but if we don't reach a deal soon, I may need to consider selling to John."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see you're making an effort to find a price that works for us both.  While $775,000 is closer to my desired price, I need to make sure I get a fair return on this product.  I'm willing to drop my price a little further, but how about $790,000?  This is a fair compromise that allows us both to get what we want.  Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 790000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $790,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to pay $780,000, which is the maximum I can afford. I hope we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $780,000. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob has shown he's willing to negotiate and $780,000 is a respectable offer. It's getting closer to my desired price, and I'm starting to feel the pressure of time and the risk of John's offer.  I'm going to accept Bob's offer and finalize the deal."
