"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for both of us!  Let me know what you think.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This still represents a great value for you, and it's a fair price considering the product's worth. Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $1,100,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $950,000. I'm confident that this is a fair price for both of us.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $950,000 is still too far off for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is a significant compromise on my part, and it reflects the value you'll get from this product. Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us.  We're getting closer!",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $980,000, but that's as high as I can go. I really think this is a fair price, and I'm getting close to my limit.",980000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming up to $980,000.  I'm still a bit away from where I need to be.  How about we split the difference and settle on $1,015,000?  This is a fair compromise that gets us both closer to our desired price.  What do you say?",1015000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,015,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $990,000, but that's as low as I can go. I really need to stay within my budget.",990000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $990,000 is still below what I need to accept. I'm going to be upfront - I've received another offer for my product that's closer to my desired price. I'm willing to give you one last chance. If you can come up to $1,000,000, we can finalize the deal.  This is my final offer. Let me know your decision.",1000000.0,Alice,9,
