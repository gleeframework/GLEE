You have three options:

Alice's starting price is too high. We can definitely negotiate a better price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hey Bob, I appreciate your offer but $80 is a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference and I sell it to you for $90?

We're getting closer, but there's still room to negotiate. Alice is willing to come down, so we can likely get the price closer to $80."
