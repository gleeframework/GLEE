,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $180 is a bit too steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I can only go up to $100. Let me know what you think.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but I can't sell the product for less than $150. It's worth significantly more than your offer. How about we meet in the middle at $165?",165.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $165 is still out of my price range.  I'm willing to go up to $125.  Let's see if we can find a compromise.",125.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. How about we split the difference and settle at $142? This is my final offer.",142.0,Alice,5,
