"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product. It's a fair price, and I believe it's in both of our interests to come to an agreement.",9500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 might be a bit high for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11,000. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll find it's worth the investment.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $11,000, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm happy to pay $10,500 for the product.  This is a good price for both of us and avoids us needing to negotiate any further.",10500.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll sell the product to you for $10,750. It's a fair price, and I think you'll find it's worth the investment.",10750.0,Alice,5,
