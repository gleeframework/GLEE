{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is too low. I'm going to try and negotiate a better price. I have 8 rounds left, and I'm still hopeful of getting closer to my desired price."

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. It's closer to my desired price, but I'm still hoping for a better deal. I have 6 rounds left and I'm not ready to settle for anything less than $11,000 yet."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}

I'm making one last attempt to meet halfway with Bob. If he rejects, I'll go ahead and sell to John. I have 5 rounds left, and I'm not willing to risk losing the deal with John for a lower price."

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm choosing to sell the product to John for $12,000. Bob's offer is my minimum, but I've already made several concessions and there are only 4 rounds left. It's not worth risking a lower price when I have a guaranteed sale with John."
