``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. It also shows that I am serious about selling but am not desperate to sell at a lower price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than that. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $8,500 is better than nothing, I am not willing to sell the product for significantly less than my minimum. I will counter Bob's offer with a higher price to see if we can reach a compromise."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, but $8,500 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to sell for $9,000. This gives you a good price and allows me to make a reasonable profit. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 9000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $8,750, but no higher. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $8,750 is closer to my minimum, I am still not comfortable selling for that low. I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price by making another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up to $8,750, but I'm still not quite there.  How about $9,250? That's halfway between our last offers, and it would allow me to move forward with the sale.  Let's find common ground and finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 9250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're trying to find common ground, but I'm still not comfortable with $9,250. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $8,750 and $9,250, which would be $9,000. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While $9,000 is still lower than my desired price, it's getting closer to my minimum.  I think it's a reasonable compromise and worth accepting rather than risking a further stalemate with Bob.  I could potentially lose more money if I continue negotiating or try to sell to John."
