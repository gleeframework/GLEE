"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you the product at a price of $950,000. This is a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable item that's worth $1,000,000 to you, and I'm willing to make a concession to make the deal happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob can potentially get a better deal than $950,000. Since the product is worth $800,000 to Alice, there's room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially save more money."

{""message"": ""I appreciate the offer, Alice. However, I'm looking to save as much as possible. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering your value and my budget. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to save money, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $925,000. This is a fair price considering the value you place on the product and the initial offer I made. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $925,000 is better than Alice's initial offer, Bob can still potentially do better. There's still a gap between Bob's desired price and Alice's offer. Rejecting allows Bob to counteroffer again and try to close that gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, I'm still not quite there. $900,000 is the absolute maximum I'm willing to pay. This price reflects the value we both have in the product and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to meet you at $920,000, Bob. This is a compromise that should work for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair price for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $920,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

At this point, Bob is getting very close to his desired price point.  It's unlikely that further negotiation will yield a much lower price.  While a price of $900,000 would be ideal, accepting Alice's offer of $920,000 still saves Bob $80,000 compared to buying from John.  It's a good compromise to avoid the risk of further negotiation and potentially ending up paying more."
