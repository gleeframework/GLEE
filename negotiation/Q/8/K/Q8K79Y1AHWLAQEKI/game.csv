"I appreciate the offer, Alice. However, I'm looking to save as much as possible. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering your value and my budget. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking to save money, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $925,000. This is a fair price considering the value you place on the product and the initial offer I made.",925000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, I'm still not quite there. $900,000 is the absolute maximum I'm willing to pay. This price reflects the value we both have in the product and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement.  Let me know what you think.",900000.0,Bob,4,
