"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $800,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $800,000 simply doesn't reflect the value of this product. I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This is a fair price that allows both of us to benefit from the deal.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $900,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $850,000. Can we discuss further?",850000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to sell for $875,000. This is a fair compromise that allows us both to benefit from the deal. Let's close this now!",875000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I understand you have a budget, but I can't go any lower than $850,000.  This is a fair price, and I'm willing to close the deal now.  What do you say?",850000.0,Alice,7,
