"Alice, $12,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm really interested in the product, but I can only offer $9,000 right now.  Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you're trying to get the best price.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $9,000 just doesn't work for me.  How about $10,500?  That's a good middle ground, and I believe it's still a fair deal for both of us.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm happy to hear you're willing to negotiate. $10,500 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $9,000. It's the best I can do right now, but I'm confident we can reach a deal that benefits both of us.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  But I'm not sure $9,000 is realistic given the value of this product.  Let's try to split the difference.  I'm willing to go down to $10,000.  This is my final offer.  If it's not acceptable, I'll have to explore other options. ",10000.0,Alice,5,
