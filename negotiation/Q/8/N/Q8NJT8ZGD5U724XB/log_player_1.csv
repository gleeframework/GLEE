"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd be interested in. I'm asking for $12,000 for it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at a price that's higher than Bob's estimated value, but still leaves room for negotiation. This gives me the best chance of getting a good price.
* **Friendly Tone:** I'm keeping the message friendly and inviting to encourage Bob to engage. 
* **10 Rounds:**  I have room to make concessions if needed, but I want to see how Bob reacts first. 
* **John as a Backstop:** Knowing John is willing to pay $15,000 gives me a safety net if negotiations with Bob fall through."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $12,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm really interested in the product, but I can only offer $9,000 right now.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  $9,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Negotiation Space:** While Bob's interest is encouraging, I still have 8 rounds to try and negotiate a better price. 
* **John's Offer:**  John offers a much better price, so I'm not in a rush to close with Bob. 

**Next Steps:** I'll make a counteroffer that's closer to my desired price, but still shows flexibility."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you're trying to get the best price.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $9,000 just doesn't work for me.  How about $10,500?  That's a good middle ground, and I believe it's still a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Show Flexibility:**  I'm demonstrating willingness to negotiate by dropping my price from $12,000 to $10,500.
* **Maintain Value:**  $10,500 is still significantly higher than Bob's offer and closer to my desired price.
* **Fair Compromise:**  I'm positioning this price as a reasonable compromise, suggesting it's a ""good middle ground.""
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm keeping the message positive and encouraging to keep the negotiation moving forward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm happy to hear you're willing to negotiate. $10,500 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $9,000. It's the best I can do right now, but I'm confident we can reach a deal that benefits both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **No Significant Change:** Bob hasn't changed his offer, which is still well below my acceptable price.
* **John's Offer:** I have a solid backup option with John who is offering $15,000.  
* **Time is on My Side:** With 6 rounds left, I have time to see if Bob will increase his offer.

**Next Steps:**  I'll make another counteroffer, but this time I'll be more firm and try to close the gap.  I might even hint at the possibility of selling to John if Bob doesn't come closer."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  But I'm not sure $9,000 is realistic given the value of this product.  Let's try to split the difference.  I'm willing to go down to $10,000.  This is my final offer.  If it's not acceptable, I'll have to explore other options. "", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:**  I'm setting a clear deadline by calling this my ""final offer,"" increasing the pressure on Bob to accept.
* **Compromise:** I've decreased my price again to show flexibility, but it's still above my minimum.
* **Alternative Option:**  I'm hinting at the possibility of selling to John if Bob doesn't accept, hoping to encourage him to make a final concession.
* **Direct Tone:** My message is more direct and focused on reaching a quick conclusion."
