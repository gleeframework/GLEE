Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll start by making an offer to Bob. Since the product is worth $1,000,000 to him, I'll try to get as close to that as possible while still making a profit. Let's say I'll offer it to him for $950,000.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","Bob's offer is lower than I expected, but I still need to consider my options carefully. Since the product is worth $1,000,000 to Bob, I know he's willing to pay a significant amount for it.

I'll decide to reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round. I'll try to make a counteroffer that's closer to the product's true value to Bob.

My counteroffer will be $850,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer, and it still leaves room for profit.
