"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase [Product Name] for $1,400,000. This is a significant discount from the value it holds for me, and I believe it's a fair price that benefits both of us. However, I'm confident in finding another buyer who values it at $1,500,000, so if this offer isn't appealing, I won't hesitate to move forward with them. Please let me know your decision at your earliest convenience. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,400,000 is lower than her stated value, you know you can get the product for $1,200,000 from John.  There's no need to pay more than your alternative option. By rejecting Alice's offer, you can move forward with buying from John and save $200,000."
