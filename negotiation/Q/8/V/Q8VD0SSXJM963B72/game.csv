"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $1,005,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my initial offer. I'm offering the product to you for $1,050,000. This is my final compromise.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
