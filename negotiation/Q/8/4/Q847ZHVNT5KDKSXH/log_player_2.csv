"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I believe a price of $1,100,000 is fair. This offer allows us both to benefit significantly from this transaction. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer ($1,100,000) is above your maximum budget.** While it's lower than John's price, it still exceeds what you're willing to pay.
* **Rejecting might lead to a better offer.** Alice knows your alternative is buying from John at a higher price. By rejecting, you signal that her offer is too high, potentially leading to a counter-offer closer to your desired range."
