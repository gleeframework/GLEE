"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product but $600,000 is a little high for me. Would you consider $450,000?",450000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $600,000 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $450,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $550,000. It's a fair price considering the value the product brings. Let me know if you're interested.",550000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're looking for a better deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $480,000. I'm willing to compromise and offer you the product for $520,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the value the product brings. Let me know if you're interested.",520000.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still not comfortable with $500,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you the product for $510,000. This is my final offer, and I think it's still a fair price considering the value the product brings. Let me know if you're interested.",510000.0,Alice,7,
