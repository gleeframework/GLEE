Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a possible offer, keeping in mind Alice's goals:

```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. I believe it would be incredibly valuable to you. I'm asking for $19,000, which reflects its true worth and potential."", ""product_price"": 19000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aim High:** Alice knows Bob values the product at $12,000, but she also has a guaranteed sale at that price to John. This gives her leverage to start high.
* **Justification:** By mentioning ""true worth and potential,"" Alice attempts to anchor the price in Bob's mind at a higher level than his initial valuation.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** This initial high price allows room for Bob to negotiate down.  Even if Bob negotiates down, Alice is likely to land a price significantly higher than $12,000.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Market Research:**  While not provided in the prompt, knowing typical prices for similar products would help Alice determine a more realistic and persuasive starting price. 
* **Bob's Personality:** If Alice knows Bob is particularly price-sensitive or a tough negotiator, she might adjust her initial offer accordingly."
