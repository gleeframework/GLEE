``` 

I'm starting with a high offer, aiming to gauge Bob's interest and potential budget.  If he rejects, I'll have a better understanding of his value perception and can adjust accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product, but my budget is limited. Would you consider accepting $15000 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. While I appreciate your interest, $15,000 is a bit lower than I'm hoping for. How about we meet in the middle at $16,500? This would be a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 16500}

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $15,500 is still a bit low for me. Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $16,000. This is a fair price that respects both our needs."", ""product_price"": 16000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $15,750 is still below what I consider fair for this product. To be reasonable, I'm willing to come down to $15,900. This is a good compromise and a price I believe we can both be happy with."", ""product_price"": 15900}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I see where you're coming from, Alice. I'll do my best to stay within my budget. Could you consider $15800 for the product?

With only two rounds remaining, it's getting risky to keep negotiating.  Bob's offer is very close to my minimum, and I don't want to risk losing the deal altogether. Accepting his offer ensures a sale and a decent profit."
