"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it very useful. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product but $100 is a little too high for my budget. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps closer to $60?"",
""product_price"": 60
}
```

This counter-offer attempts to:

* **Be polite and show interest:** Maintaining a good relationship can lead to a better deal.
* **Anchor a low price:** Starting significantly lower than our target ($80) gives us room for negotiation.
* **Provide a reason:**  Mentioning a budget constraint can make the counter-offer seem more reasonable. 

We'll see how Alice responds and adjust our strategy in the next round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $60 is too low for me, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $85?  That's still a good deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is getting closer to our target price, but we're not there yet. Rejecting this offer keeps the negotiation going and gives us a chance to get closer to $80."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice. $85 is closer, but I'm aiming for something closer to $70. Would that work for you?"",
""product_price"": 70
}
```

Here's our strategy for this round:

* **Acknowledge the compromise:** We want Alice to feel like we're moving towards a deal together.
* **Incremental increase:**  We're moving up from our initial low offer, showing willingness to negotiate.
* **Stay below our limit:** We're still aiming for a price that saves us money compared to John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're aiming for $70, but that's still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $75?  It's a fair price for both of us, and we can move forward with the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $75
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice is meeting us in the middle at $75. This is a good deal compared to John's $80 offer, and continuing to negotiate might not yield a significantly better outcome.  It's time to accept and secure the savings."
