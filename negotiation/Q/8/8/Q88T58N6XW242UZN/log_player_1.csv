"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it very useful. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $100, which is closer to my minimum acceptable price ($120) than Bob's perceived value ($80). This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Friendly Tone:** The message is friendly and positive to build rapport and encourage Bob to consider the offer.
* **Value Proposition:** I highlight the potential value of the product for Bob.

I'm aiming for a quick deal but am prepared to negotiate further if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product but $100 is a little too high for my budget. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps closer to $60? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low.**  $60 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $120. 
* **There's room for negotiation.** I'm willing to negotiate, but I won't settle for such a drastic price drop this early in the process. 
* **Selling to John is a good option.** Since John is willing to pay my minimum price, I'm not desperate to make a deal with Bob.

I will counter Bob's offer with a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $60 is too low for me, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $85?  That's still a good deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit."", ""product_price"": 85}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Towards a Compromise:** My counteroffer of $85 is a significant step down from my initial offer, showing flexibility. 
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm reminding Bob that he's getting a good deal at $85.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  This counteroffer still leaves room for further negotiation, but it's closer to my minimum acceptable price. 

I'm aiming to find a middle ground that both of us can agree on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you working with me, Alice. $85 is closer, but I'm aiming for something closer to $70. Would that work for you? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still too low:** $70 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $120, and significantly lower than what I'm willing to accept at this point.
* **Negotiation is ongoing:** Bob is showing a willingness to negotiate, which is a positive sign. I'm not ready to give up yet, but I need to push for a better price.
* **Selling to John is a strong backup:**  I'm still aware of John's offer and could walk away at any moment. This gives me leverage.

I will counteroffer Bob with a price that's closer to my minimum but still leaves room for compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're aiming for $70, but that's still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $75?  It's a fair price for both of us, and we can move forward with the deal."", ""product_price"": 75} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** I'm offering $75, which is the midpoint between my previous offer of $85 and Bob's current offer of $70. This demonstrates a commitment to reaching a compromise.
* **Emphasizing Fairness:**  I'm framing the price as fair for both of us, making it more appealing to Bob. 
* **Urgency Implied:**  I'm suggesting we move forward, subtly implying that I'm open to closing the deal but not endlessly negotiating.

This counteroffer is a serious attempt to close the deal while still staying above my minimum acceptable price. I'm ready to accept if Bob agrees, but I'm also prepared to continue negotiating."
