The product is worth $12,000 to you, and Alice is asking $13,000. It's better to reject her offer and try to negotiate a lower price."

Alice's offer:

Alice has come down from $13,000 to $12,500, but that's still more than you're willing to pay. You're trying to save as much as possible, and there's still room for negotiation.  You'll try to get her to come down even further."
