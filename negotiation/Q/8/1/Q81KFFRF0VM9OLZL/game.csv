"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000.  It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $1,000,000 to you. Let's make this happen!",950000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. I'm interested in the product, but I have to make sure it fits within my budget. Can we meet in the middle?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $850,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000, which still offers you a significant value. Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $900,000, but I'm still a bit above my target. Can you meet me at $875,000? I'm confident that's a price that will make this deal work for both of us.",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer.  However, $875,000 is still a bit below where I need to be. How about $890,000? It's a good compromise, and we can finally close this deal. What do you say?",890000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to my target, but $890,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $875,000 and $890,000, which is $882,500. Can we make that work?",882500.0,Bob,6,
