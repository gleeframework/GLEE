{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. It's worth a great deal to you, and I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.  My initial offer is $900,000.  Let's see if we can find a good price point for both of us."", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a price of $750,000 for the product. I believe this offers a fair compromise while still allowing me to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price of $800,000.  While I want to make a deal, selling to John is still a better option than accepting Bob's offer at this point. I will counteroffer Bob in the next round to try and reach a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but it's a bit lower than what I'm hoping for.  Considering the value this product holds for you, I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This still allows me to get a fair price and gives you a substantial opportunity for profit. Let's keep working together to find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. Based on our previous discussions, I would like to propose a price of $800,000 for the product. This aligns closely with the value I perceive in the item, and I hope this proposal will lead to a satisfactory conclusion for both parties. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is now at my minimum acceptable price of $800,000.  While I would prefer to get more, accepting his offer guarantees me a sale and avoids the risk of further negotiations potentially failing.  It's a good outcome for me."
