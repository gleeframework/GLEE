"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective on the pricing. However, the value of this product is significantly higher than your offer reflects. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,350,000.  Let me know if this revised price works for you.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice, but I still think $1,350,000 is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to meet you halfway, though. How about $1,275,000?",1275000.0,Bob,4,
