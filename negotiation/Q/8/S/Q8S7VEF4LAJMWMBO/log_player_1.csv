Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product which I know you'll find valuable. I'm willing to part with it for $110."", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $120, meaning he would be willing to pay up to that amount.
* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $80 from John, so any offer to Bob needs to be above that to be worthwhile.
* **Maximizing Profit:**  Offering the product at $110 leaves some room for negotiation (if Bob wants to haggle) while still securing a significant profit for you. This price point is attractive to Bob while still very beneficial for you. 

This strategy aims to secure the highest possible price from Bob while ensuring you don't lose the sale entirely."
