"Bob, I understand you're looking for the best deal, and I appreciate your offer. However, $920,000 is a bit too low for me right now.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $940,000. This reflects the value of the product and gives you a significant saving.  What do you think?",940000.0,Alice,3,
