"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's a unique opportunity that can significantly enhance your business operations. Considering its value and the benefits it offers, I'm extending this exclusive offer to you for $10,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to get the product for as close to $8,000 as possible.  Alice's initial offer of $10,000 is too high. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price.  There are still 9 rounds to go, so there's time to bargain."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value of the product, $10,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and would like to make a proposal that could be beneficial for both of us. I am willing to consider your offer of $8,500, but I need to maintain a reasonable profit margin. Therefore, I propose we agree on a price of $9,000 for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to Bob's desired price, but it's still a bit too high. There are still 7 rounds left, so Bob can keep negotiating.  Rejecting Alice's offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and hopefully close the gap further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $9,000 is closer, but still a little outside my comfort zone.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  How about $8,750?  That's a fair compromise, and I'm ready to close the deal at that price."", ""product_price"": 8750}
