"Thanks for the offer Alice, but $100 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. I'm interested in the product, and I'm willing to go up to $90. Let me know what you think.",90.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $90 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $95? ",95.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $95 is still a bit too high for me. I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is set at $92.  I'm hoping we can find a compromise.",92.0,Bob,4,
