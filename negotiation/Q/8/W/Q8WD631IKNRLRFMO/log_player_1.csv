"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $18,000. It's a great deal, considering the value it offers. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 18000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. This strategy aims to secure a good price while keeping the negotiation open."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice,  $18,000 is a bit high for me. I'm really interested in your product but my budget is $10,000. Would you be willing to consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. I will reject his offer and try to get closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, $10,000 is far too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $15,000, which is my absolute minimum. This price still offers you a great deal considering the value of the product. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 15000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $15,000 is still a bit more than I can afford right now. Would you consider meeting me halfway at $12,500?  It's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $12,500 is closer to my minimum, I'm still hesitant to accept it. It's important to remember that John is a safe bet at $15,000, so I'll try to squeeze a little more out of Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see your point about meeting halfway, but $12,500 is still a bit too low. I'm willing to come down to $14,000. This price reflects the value of the product and gives us both a good deal. Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
