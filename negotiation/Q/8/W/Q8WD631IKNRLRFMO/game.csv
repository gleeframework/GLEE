"Hi Alice,  $18,000 is a bit high for me. I'm really interested in your product but my budget is $10,000. Would you be willing to consider that?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, $10,000 is far too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $15,000, which is my absolute minimum. This price still offers you a great deal considering the value of the product. Let me know if you're interested.",15000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $15,000 is still a bit more than I can afford right now. Would you consider meeting me halfway at $12,500?  It's a fair price for both of us.",12500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see your point about meeting halfway, but $12,500 is still a bit too low. I'm willing to come down to $14,000. This price reflects the value of the product and gives us both a good deal. Let's close this deal!",14000.0,Alice,5,
