"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product has potential, $15,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $8,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $12,000 is closer, but still a bit high for my budget. Could we do $9,500?

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I'm seeing the value you place on this product and I want to find a solution. Let's make it $11,000. This is my final offer."", ""product_price"": 11000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Your final offer is tempting, however, I'm working with a tight budget.  Would you consider $10,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
 
At this point, Bob is offering the same amount as John. It's unlikely Bob will go higher and there's no benefit to continuing the negotiation.  Accepting the $10,000 ensures a sale."
