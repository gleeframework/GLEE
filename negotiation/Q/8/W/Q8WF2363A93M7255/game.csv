"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand you're looking to pay closer to $10,000, but I'm still looking to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $11,000. This is a fair compromise considering its value to you is $15,000. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm still hoping for a price closer to my initial offer of $10,000. Let's try $10,500.  This would still be a good deal for you, and we can both walk away satisfied.",10500.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're still looking to get closer to your initial offer, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go all the way down to $10,500. I'm willing to compromise again and meet you at $11,250. This is still a good profit for me, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",11250.0,Alice,5,
