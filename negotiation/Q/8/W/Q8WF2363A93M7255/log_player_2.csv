Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm close to accepting your offer, Bob, but I still need to make a decent profit. I'm willing to meet you at $11,200. This is a small increase from your last offer, but I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down significantly from her initial offer. At $11,200, I'm getting a good deal while still saving a substantial amount compared to John's price.  Continuing to negotiate risks running out of rounds and having to pay John's price. It's better to accept and secure the deal."
