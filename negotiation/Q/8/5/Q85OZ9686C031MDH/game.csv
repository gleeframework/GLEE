"Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you.  It's worth at least $1,000,000 to me, and I'm confident it would be equally valuable to you.  I'm offering it to you for $1,050,000.  This is a fair price considering the product's potential, and it gives you a chance to secure something truly exceptional.  Let me know if you're interested, and we can discuss the details further.",1050000.0,Alice,1,
