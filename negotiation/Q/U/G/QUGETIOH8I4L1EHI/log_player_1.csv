Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,000,000 from John, so you won't accept anything less.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,200,000, meaning he has a potential profit margin of $200,000 if he buys it from you.
* **Your Leverage:** You have a backup buyer, giving you a strong position to negotiate a higher price.

**The Offer**

You want to aim high but leave Bob with a reason to accept. Here's a possible approach:

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering the significant benefits it offers you."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Explanation**

* **High Target:**  $1,150,000 secures you most of the potential profit while staying below Bob's maximum valuation.
* **Justification:**  Highlighting the ""unique value and potential"" subtly reminds Bob of the $200,000 profit he stands to make.
* **""Fair Offer"":** Framing it this way encourages Bob to see it as a win-win rather than a one-sided deal.

**Important Considerations**

* **Bob's Personality:** If you know Bob is a tough negotiator, you might start slightly higher. 
* **Relationship:** If maintaining a good relationship with Bob is crucial, you might consider a slightly lower price for long-term benefits.

**Remember:**  This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters."
