"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $1,150,000. It's a unique item with a value well exceeding this price, and I believe you'll find it highly beneficial.  However, if you decline, I have another buyer ready to acquire it for $1,000,000. So, this is a chance for you to secure a significant advantage. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to create a sense of urgency and pressure you into accepting a price higher than her own valuation. She mentions another buyer at $1,000,000, which may or may not be true. 

While $1,150,000 is within your budget, you know you have a backup option with John at $1,200,000.  There's a chance Alice might be willing to lower her price if you reject this initial offer."
