{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $90.  It's a great deal and I'm sure you'll find it very useful."", ""product_price"": 90}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than what the product is worth to Bob, hoping to secure a good deal.  I'll be flexible, but I won't go below my minimum of $80."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $90 is a bit too high for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $60 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is too low. I'm not willing to sell for $60.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can come to a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest but $60 is too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $75?  That's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to what the product is worth to me."", ""product_price"": 75}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $75 is still a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $65 for the product. That's the highest I'm willing to go 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $65. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $65
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Bob's offer is still too low.  I'd rather sell the product to John for $80, which is a better deal for me."
