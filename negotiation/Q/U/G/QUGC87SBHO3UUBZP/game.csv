"I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I believe it's worth every penny, but I'm willing to make a concession to get the ball rolling. I'll offer it to you for $1,200,000.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in this product, $1,200,000 is unfortunately outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it, reflecting its potential value to me. I'm confident this is a fair price that benefits both of us.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to make an offer, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to accept $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a bit more than that. How about we discuss $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,100,000 is still too high for me.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to pay $950,000. This would leave us both with a good deal and allow us to move forward.",950000.0,Bob,4,
