"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,150,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. Given my understanding of the product's value, I'm prepared to offer $1,050,000. This would be a good starting point for a mutually beneficial agreement.  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Round 3

{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective on the pricing.  However, the value this product brings is substantial, and I believe my initial offer was reflective of that.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,120,000.  This demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while still recognizing the true worth of what's on the table."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to adjust the price. While I recognize the value of the product,  $1,120,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial price point. To that end, I'm prepared to offer $1,080,000. Let's keep working towards a deal that works for both of us.  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,080,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is incrementally increasing his offer, indicating a willingness to negotiate.  We're still significantly above John's offer, so the risk of losing the deal by continuing to negotiate is low."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence in finding a price that works for both of us. I'm motivated to close this deal, so I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair and reasonable offer that reflects the true value of the product."",

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting very close to an agreement.  To demonstrate my commitment to a deal, I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,090,000.  This is a good compromise that keeps us both in a favorable position. Let's finalize this and move forward. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,090,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,090,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**  Bob's offer is now very close to our previous counteroffer. Continuing to negotiate for small increments at this stage carries a higher risk of losing the deal altogether. Accepting $1,090,000 secures a substantial profit above our minimum acceptable price."
