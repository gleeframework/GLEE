"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this exceptional product. After careful consideration, I'm willing to sell it to you for $800,000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere.",800000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $800,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $500,000?",500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $500,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $700,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and rarity.",700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. While $700,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch for my budget. How about we settle at $600,000? That seems like a fair compromise.",600000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $600,000. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer: $650,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price for the product's value and rarity.",650000.0,Alice,5,
