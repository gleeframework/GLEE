"I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment. I'm willing to start with an offer of $1,200,000.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in the product, $1,200,000 is unfortunately a bit too steep for me. I'm willing to offer $850,000 for it, which is still a significant investment for me. What do you think?",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. However, I still need to make a profit, so I'm willing to compromise. I'm counteroffering at $1,100,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, but I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,100,000 is still out of my price range.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $850,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and my budget. If we can't agree on this, I will unfortunately have to look elsewhere.",850000.0,Bob,4,
