**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better for Bob:**  The product is worth $15,000 to Bob, and Alice is offering it for $13,500. This means Bob saves $1,500 compared to buying from John.
* **Bob's goal is to save money:**  Even though the product is worth more to Bob, the goal is to get it at the lowest possible price."
