"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000} 
```

I'm starting with a high offer, just below Bob's estimated value.  This gives me room to negotiate while still securing a good profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While it's a decent price, I can likely get more if I continue negotiating.  I'm not ready to sell to John yet as Bob's offer is still above my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000} 
```

I'm offering a price that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer. This shows I'm willing to compromise, but still aiming for a good price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's getting closer to my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price. Selling to John is still not the best option right now."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000} 
```

I'm offering Bob the same price as his last counteroffer. This shows I'm serious about closing the deal but I'm not willing to go lower.  The risk of reaching round 10 is increasing, so I'm hoping he'll accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer again.  While I'm getting close to my minimum, I'm not ready to give up yet.  I still believe I can get a better price, and I'm not ready to sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000} 
```

I'm offering Bob the same price as his last offer. This shows I'm serious about closing the deal and willing to meet him halfway.  We're getting close to round 10 and selling to John is becoming more appealing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm choosing to sell to John. With only two rounds remaining, Bob's offers are getting too close to my minimum for comfort, and there's a high risk I'll be forced to accept a price I'm not happy with.  Selling to John guarantees me a profit, and it's the safest option at this point."
