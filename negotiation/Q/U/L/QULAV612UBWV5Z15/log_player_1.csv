Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

```

Bob's offer is still significantly lower than what I'd like to get, and I'm confident I can push for a higher price.  It's worth continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm lowering my price a bit, showing flexibility, but still holding firm on a value that's closer to my desired outcome."

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000

Bob is not budging much, and at this point, I'm closer to my minimum acceptable price with John.  Selling to John ensures a secure deal and minimizes the risk of further negotiation."
