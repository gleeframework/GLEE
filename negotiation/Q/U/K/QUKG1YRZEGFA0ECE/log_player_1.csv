"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 950000} 

I'm starting with a high offer, but one that still leaves room for negotiation and is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price. This allows me to gauge Bob's interest and potentially secure a good deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's my minimum acceptable price, and I still have room to negotiate with him. I believe I can get a better price by continuing the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

I'm lowering my price slightly, but still keeping it above my minimum acceptable price. This shows Bob that I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm also not willing to give away too much. I'm hoping that this counteroffer will be more appealing to Bob and we can reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is close to my minimum acceptable price, and I'm running out of time. Accepting his offer ensures I get a good price and avoids the risk of him rejecting my counteroffer or me having to sell to John for a lower price."
