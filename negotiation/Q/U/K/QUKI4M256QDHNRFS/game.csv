"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,400,000 is still a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product.  This represents a good deal for both of us, as it's still above my maximum value and allows for a significant profit for you.",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking that we could meet in the middle at $1,350,000. This would still be a good deal for both of us, considering the product's value to you and the profit I'd make. What do you think?",1350000.0,Alice,3,
