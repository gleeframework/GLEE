"Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob can do better than $900,000. He can try to negotiate with Alice and see if he can get a lower price.  There's still room for both of them to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob is starting with a counteroffer of $850,000. This is a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer of $900,000, but still leaves room for Alice to make a profit ($50,000). This is a good starting point for negotiation, as it shows Bob is serious about buying the product but also wants a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $880,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $880,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $880,000 is a good deal for Bob. It's lower than his initial counteroffer of $850,000 and closer to his desired price range. While he could potentially negotiate further, there's a risk Alice might reject his next offer or decide to sell to someone else.  It's better to accept the offer and secure the product at a good price than to risk losing it altogether."
