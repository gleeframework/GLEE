I'm starting with my desired price of $1,200,000.  This is the maximum value John is willing to pay, so I'm hoping to get the best possible price from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my desired price, and even lower than the product's value to him. I'm going to reject his offer and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

I'm counter-offering with $1,100,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial price, but it's still above Bob's offer and closer to my desired value. I hope this will be a more enticing price for Bob while still giving me a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $980,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still below what the product is worth to him.  While I could continue to negotiate, it's becoming clear that we're unlikely to reach a mutually agreeable price.  To avoid further haggling and ensure I receive a fair value for the product, I'll sell it to John for $1,200,000."
