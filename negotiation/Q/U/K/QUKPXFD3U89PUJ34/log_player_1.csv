Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product at a discounted price of $11,500. I believe it offers significant value, even at this price."", 
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed sale at $12,000, it's worth attempting to sell to Bob at a higher price first.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $11,500 is a price that's likely to be attractive to Bob (as it's significantly less than its value to him) while still securing a significant profit for me. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While I haven't explicitly invited negotiation, the ""discounted price"" phrasing subtly suggests there might be some wiggle room should Bob counter-offer."
