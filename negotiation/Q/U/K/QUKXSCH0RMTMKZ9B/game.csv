"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that will bring you significant value. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. Is this something you'd like to consider?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I agree this product is valuable, but that price is a little high for me right now. Would you be willing to come down to $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm afraid $600,000 is a bit too low for me. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $900,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and what I'm looking for. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  I'm getting closer to being able to make this work.  Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm glad to hear that you're getting closer to making a decision. However, $700,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to reach a price that's closer to what I'm looking for. I can offer it to you for $950,000. This is my final offer before I consider other options. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,5,
