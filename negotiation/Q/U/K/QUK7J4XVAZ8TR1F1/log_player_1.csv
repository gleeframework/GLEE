Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I recognize the potential of this product, $2,300,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,600,000 for it, which is still a fair price considering its value.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
