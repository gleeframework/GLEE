I'm starting with a price of $175. This gives me a decent profit margin while still being potentially attractive to Bob since the product is worth $150 to him.  I'm hoping to get a good deal, but I'm also prepared to walk away and sell to John if Bob doesn't come close to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $160
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum price, but I'm still hoping to get a bit more. I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 165}
```

I'm going to counter with $165. This is still a good profit for me, and I believe it might be enough to convince Bob to accept.  It's a compromise, but I'm not willing to go any lower without risking selling to John for the minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $155. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $155
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is $155, which is just $5 less than what John is offering. While I'd prefer to get more, I'm not sure I can get a better deal from Bob. Accepting his offer is the best choice since I can get a profit of $5, and I don't have to risk waiting for another round and possibly losing the sale to John."
