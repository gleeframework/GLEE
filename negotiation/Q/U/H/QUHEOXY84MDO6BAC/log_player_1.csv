Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of your product, but I am only willing to pay up to $12,000 for it. Could we possibly come to an agreement within this budget? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to try to squeeze a bit more out of Bob. I know he values the product at $12,000, so I'm not willing to sell it for less than that. But I'll see if I can get him to pay a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to go that low. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000?  I believe it's still a fair price considering the value you'll get out of the product. Let's see if we can make this happen."", ""product_price"": 13000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I am still unable to exceed $12,000 for the product. I hope we can reach an agreement that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob has been firm at $12,000, and I'm not willing to risk going lower. I've made two counteroffers already, and it seems like he won't budge.  John is a guaranteed $12,000, which is my minimum, so it's time to move on."
