Let's try to negotiate a better price with Alice first.  $175 is higher than my budget."

Round 2

{

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $110. How about we meet in the middle at $155? It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice is coming down, but $155 is still more than I want to pay when I have another option at $150. I'll try to negotiate a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand, Alice. I'm trying to stick to a tight budget.  Could you do $130? That's a fair offer."",

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to stick to a budget, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $130. How about we try $142? It's a compromise, but I think it's a fair price for this amazing product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $142. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $142
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is getting closer to a price I'm willing to accept, but I'm still willing to see if I can get it for a bit less. It's worth another round of negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me on the price, Alice.  How about $135? That's the best I can do."",
""product_price"": 135
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to be reasonable, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $135. How about we try $145? It's getting close to the minimum I'm willing to accept, but I think it's still a fair price for this product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $145
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

It seems unlikely Alice will go below $145. It's not worth continuing the negotiation to save only a few dollars when I have a guaranteed option with John at $150."
