Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to buy this product for $120. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:**  Bob values the product at $150, so there's room to negotiate above your minimum price.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $80.
* **Maximizing Profit:** Offering a price around $120 aims to capture a significant portion of the value difference ($150 - $80 = $70) while still leaving Bob with a perceived gain ($150 - $120 = $30). 

This strategy balances your desire for profit with the need to make the offer attractive enough for Bob to accept."
