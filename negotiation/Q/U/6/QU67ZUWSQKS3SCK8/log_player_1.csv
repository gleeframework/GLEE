"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my budget and the product's value to me. Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we agree on $1,000,000?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  I understand you're holding firm on the value, but $1,000,000 is still a bit outside my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $950,000.  This would be a win-win,  allowing you a good price and me a great deal.  Let's see if we can finalize this. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

While Bob is moving closer to a reasonable price, the difference is still significant enough that it's time to cut negotiations and take the guaranteed $1,200,000 from John."
