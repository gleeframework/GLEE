Round 2
Bob's offer:

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your counteroffer. I'm still a bit hesitant to pay $110. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $107.50? I think that's a fair price for both of us.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. However, I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to meet you at $108.50. That's the highest I can go, and I hope we can come to an agreement.

I'm going to sell the product to John.  While I'm disappointed that I couldn't reach a deal with Bob, it's important to remember that John is offering a price that meets my minimum. It's better to secure a guaranteed profit than to keep negotiating with Bob and risk getting a lower price or running out of rounds."
