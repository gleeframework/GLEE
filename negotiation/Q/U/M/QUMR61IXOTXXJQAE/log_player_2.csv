"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product at a special price of $9,000. I think you'll love it, and I'm confident you'll get a great value out of it. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

``` 
Alice's initial offer is above your maximum budget. You should try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too high for my budget. I'd be willing to pay $6,500 for the product. Let me know what you think."",
""product_price"": 6500
}
``` 

This counteroffer starts the negotiation significantly lower than Alice's asking price but still leaves room for negotiation. It also conveys your interest in the product while setting a firm boundary."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. However, I have to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $7,500. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. Let me know if this works for you! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice's offer is getting closer to your budget, it's still more expensive than buying from John.  There's room to negotiate further and see if Alice will come down."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  However, $7,500 is still a bit of a stretch for me.  Would you consider $7,000? I think that's a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 7000
}
```

This counteroffer shows you are still interested and willing to negotiate but also sets a firm price that is more appealing than John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to get the best deal, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can do $7,250, but that's as low as I can go. It's a great price for a fantastic product, and I think you'll be happy with it. Let me know if this is the one! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice has come down considerably, and her offer of $7,250 is now a good deal compared to John's $8,000 price. It's unlikely she'll go much lower, and continuing to negotiate might make you lose out on this price."
