Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. Given its value, I think a starting price of $14,500 is fair. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit high for me. I'm thinking closer to $10,000 would be a good starting point. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet in the middle. How about we settle on $11,500? That's a fair compromise.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I'm sensing we're getting closer. I could come down to $12,500, my final offer. It's a great deal for a product you'll benefit from greatly."", ""product_price"": 12500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $12,500 is a bit too much for my budget.  I can do $11,800, and I promise that's the best I can offer.  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

While Bob is slowly increasing his offer, it's clear he's unlikely to reach a price that's significantly better than what John is offering. Accepting $11,800 would only be a marginal gain over the guaranteed $12,000. It's time to cut my losses and sell to John."
