"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm willing to part with it for $925,000. This is a one-time offer, so I encourage you to consider it carefully. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's offer:** You can get the product for $925,000 from Alice, which is cheaper than the $1,000,000 price from John. 
* **However, there is still room for negotiation:** Since the product is worth $800,000 to Alice, you can likely get a better price if you reject the offer and try to negotiate further."
