Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm starting with my minimum acceptable price, $12,000.  While Bob values the product at $10,000, I'm hoping he'll see the value in my product and be willing to negotiate. This gives me the best chance of getting the full value of the product. 

If he rejects, I'll assess his counteroffer and proceed accordingly. I'll keep John as a backup option, but I'm confident I can reach an agreement with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price.  While I want to sell the product,  $9,000 is too far below my bottom line.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground.  I'll keep John in mind as a backup if negotiations don't work out."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm going to counter with $11,000. This is still above Bob's offer, but it shows I'm willing to negotiate. I believe $11,000 is a fair price that reflects the value of the product.  If Bob rejects, I'll have to consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While $10,200 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000, it's getting closer.  It's only slightly below John's offer, and considering the risk of further negotiation, I'd rather secure the sale with Bob."
