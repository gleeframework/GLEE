"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this valuable product. I understand it's worth $800,000 to you, and I'm willing to be flexible on the price to make this a mutually beneficial deal. My initial offer is $1,300,000. Let's discuss this further.",1300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $1,300,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $900,000 is simply too low for me to consider.  I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $1,100,000?  This would allow both of us to walk away with a good deal.  Let's work together to find a solution.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Alice, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer. How about $950,000? I think this is a fair price considering the value I'll get from the product.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming up with a new offer, but I'm still not comfortable with $950,000.  I'm prepared to lower my price a bit more, but only to $1,050,000.  This represents a significant compromise from my initial position, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's find a way to reach an agreement.",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from your last offer. How about $1,025,000? I think this is a fair price considering the value I'll get from the product.",1025000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob,  I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate, but $1,025,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, at $1,037,500.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product and our ongoing discussions. Let's close this deal and move forward.",1037500.0,Alice,7,

,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see we're getting closer.  $1,012,500 is still not quite there, but I'm willing to make one final concession. Let's meet in the middle at $1,025,000. This is the best I can do,  I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product and our ongoing negotiations. Let's make this happen.",1025000.0,Alice,9,
