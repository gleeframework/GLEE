"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $11,500 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to get it for closer to $10,000.  Would you be willing to come down a bit?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your desire to get the product at a lower price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11,000. I believe this is a fair compromise considering its value to you.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. How about we split the difference and settle on $10,500?  That feels like a fair price for both of us.",10500.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your desire to get the product at a lower price, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $10,500. I'm willing to make another compromise and offer it to you for $10,750. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you, and I'm willing to meet you halfway again.",10750.0,Alice,5,
