"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your counteroffer.  While I understand your perspective, $9,000 is simply too low for me.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to drop the price to $11,000. This reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,
