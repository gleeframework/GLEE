"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you my unique product. Given its value and quality, I believe it's worth more than $100 to you. Considering its true worth, I am offering it to you for $150.

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product, $150 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $100 for it, which is the maximum I'm comfortable spending. Let me know if that works for you.",100.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and respect your budget constraints. After careful consideration, I am willing to meet you halfway. How about we agree on a price of $125 for the product? This allows you to purchase the item without exceeding your comfort level while still compensating me fairly for the value of the product.",125.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $125 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm sticking with my offer of $100. This is fair considering the product is worth that to me, and it allows you to make a sale. Let's close this deal.",100.0,Bob,4,
