Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd find valuable. I'm willing to offer it to you for $120.  Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high but reasonable:** Offering the product at $120 leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer. It's significantly more than his perceived value ($80) but less than John's guaranteed offer ($150).
* **Encouraging a response:** The message is framed positively, highlighting potential value for Bob and expressing a willingness to negotiate. This makes it more likely for Bob to engage, even if it's to counter-offer. 

This strategy aims to maximize profit while keeping the offer attractive enough for Bob to consider, avoiding a guaranteed sale to John at a lower price."
