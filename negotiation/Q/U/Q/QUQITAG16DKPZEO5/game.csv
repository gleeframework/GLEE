"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of the product to you, but I believe I can't afford $11,000 at the moment. Would you consider lowering the price to $9,500? I would greatly appreciate it.",9500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $10,250? It's still a good deal for you, considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",10250.0,Alice,3,
