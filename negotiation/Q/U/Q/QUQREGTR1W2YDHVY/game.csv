"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I believe would be of great value to you. I'm asking for $12,000 for it.  What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I understand your perspective, $9,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $10,500? That seems like a fair price considering the value it brings you.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm afraid $10,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to meet you at $9,000, as I think it's a fair price for the product",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9,000 doesn't quite cover my costs. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $9,500. This is a significant compromise, but I'm hoping we can find a solution that works for both of us.",9500.0,Alice,5,
