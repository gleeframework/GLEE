{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $11,000 is a bit higher than I was hoping for. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant step down from Alice's offer, but it's still within Bob's budget.  It leaves room for negotiation but also shows Bob is serious about making a deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,500.  This is a great deal for a product worth so much to you.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price, but $10,500 is still a bit high for me. Let's meet in the middle at $10,000.  This price would be fair for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the sale."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is proposing a price that's closer to his initial offer of $9,500, but still higher than Alice's value of $8,000.  This counteroffer shows that Bob is serious about negotiating, but also willing to compromise."
