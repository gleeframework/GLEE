Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $11,000 is a bit higher than I was hoping for. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I will reject Bob's offer. While $9,500 is better than selling to John, I believe I can get closer to my desired price with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,500.  This is a great deal for a product worth so much to you.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price, but $10,500 is still a bit high for me. Let's meet in the middle at $10,000.  This price would be fair for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the sale. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
I will accept Bob's offer.  $10,000 is a good price, considering the product is worth more to Bob. It's a good middle ground, and  better than selling to John."
