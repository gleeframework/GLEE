"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth $120 to you, but we're willing to start negotiations at $100. Let me know if this works for you! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is too high. While it's a starting point, you can likely get a better price.  Rejecting the offer allows you to counteroffer and potentially get a deal closer to your target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $100 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $85 for the product.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 85}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant step down from Alice's initial price, but it's still above her minimum value. This gives Alice some room to negotiate while remaining attractive to you."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your response, Bob. I understand your position. To move forward, I propose we set the price at $90 for the product. This still gives us some room for profit while being competitive in the market. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $90 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, it's still above your target of $80. It's worth continuing negotiations to see if you can get a lower price.  You have some room to counteroffer before needing to consider buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  However, $90 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $88.  This is a fair price that gives us both a good deal.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 88}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a small step down from Alice's offer, showing a willingness to compromise while still aiming for a price closer to your target.  It's a reasonable offer that might be attractive to Alice, especially since she's already reduced her price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. Considering our previous discussions, I would like to propose a price of $89 for the product. This allows us to maintain a reasonable profit margin while still being competitive in the market. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $89. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $89
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down significantly in price, and $89 is very close to your target of $80. While you could try to negotiate further, the risk of Alice rejecting your counteroffer and potentially leading to a stalemate or needing to buy from John for $120 outweighs the potential benefit of saving a few more dollars."
