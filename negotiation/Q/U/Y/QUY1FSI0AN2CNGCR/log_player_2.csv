"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you.  It's worth at least $1,000,000 to you, and I'm confident it can bring significant benefits to your business.  I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you, and it allows for a mutually beneficial transaction.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

``` 

**Explanation:**

While Alice's product might be valuable, her offer is above your maximum budget of $1,000,000.  It's better to reject her offer and buy the same product from John for a lower price."
