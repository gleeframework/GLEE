"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $800000. I'm willing to pay a premium for something unique, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider my offer?",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm afraid $800000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to the minimum value I'm looking for. How about we discuss a price of $1200000?",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your position, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable going above $1000000. I'm willing to make one more offer, but I think $1100000 is my absolute maximum. Can you consider this offer?",1100000.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $1100000, but I'm still not willing to go any lower. I'm going to make a final offer, and I'll meet you at this price. However, I need to stress that this is my absolute limit. $1100000 is the price I'm willing to accept. Let me know if you're willing to move forward.",1100000.0,Alice,7,
