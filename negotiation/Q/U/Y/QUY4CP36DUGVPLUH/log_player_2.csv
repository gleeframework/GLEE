"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you at a special price of $15000.  This is a significant opportunity, as the product is worth at least $10000 to me and I'm confident it can be even more valuable in your hands. Please let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","I'm not interested in paying $15,000 for the product. It's above my budget. I'll reject the offer.
