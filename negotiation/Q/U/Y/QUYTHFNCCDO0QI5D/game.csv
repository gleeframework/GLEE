"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're starting the negotiation, I'm willing to offer it to you for $18,000. I think this is a great starting point, considering its worth $15,000 to you.",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you starting the conversation. While I'm interested in the product, $18,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to offer $16,000 for it, which still leaves some room for profit for you. Let's see if we can find common ground.",16000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking that the product's value is higher than $16,000. Considering our conversation, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $17,500. I believe this is a fair price that still reflects the product's value to you.",17500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective on the value of the product. However, $17,500 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to go up to $16,500, which I believe is a fair compromise. Let's see if we can reach an agreement on this price.",16500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $16,500 is still a bit below your target, Bob. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer it to you for $17,000. This price is still a good compromise, considering the product's value to you and the effort I'm putting into the negotiation. Let's see if we can reach an agreement on this price.",17000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to continue negotiating, but $17,000 is still beyond my budget. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $16,500. It's a fair price considering the product's value to both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement on this final offer before I have to consider other options.",16500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're sticking to your offer of $16,500, but I'm not willing to compromise further. I'm willing to make one more offer to try to reach an agreement. I'll offer it to you for $16,750. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value and the effort I've put into our negotiation. Let's see if we can finally reach an agreement on this price.",16750.0,Alice,7,
