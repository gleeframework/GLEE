"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to acquire a unique product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing an initial price of $950,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the significant benefits it will bring to your operations.",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $850,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the market value of similar products.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $850,000 undervalues the unique aspects and benefits of this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $900,000? This reflects my desire to find a mutually agreeable price while ensuring a fair deal for both of us.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. While $900,000 is still a bit high for me, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'd like to counteroffer at $875,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value and our previous discussions.",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, and I'm keen on reaching a deal. However,  $875,000 is still below what I consider a fair price. I'm willing to come down slightly to $890,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it reflects the true value of the product while acknowledging your interest.",890000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $890,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to compromise further and make a counteroffer of $880,000. I believe this is a fair price considering our previous discussions and the product's value.",880000.0,Bob,6,
