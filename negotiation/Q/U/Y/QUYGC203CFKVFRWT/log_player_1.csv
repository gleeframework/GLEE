While I could push for a higher price, accepting Bob's offer of $880,000 is the most strategic decision at this point. Here's why:

* **Significant Profit:**  $880,000 is a substantial profit margin over my minimum acceptable price of $800,000.
* **Negotiation Fatigue:**  Continuing negotiations could lead to frustration or cause Bob to lose interest. 
* **Time Value of Money:** Closing the deal now provides immediate capital that can be reinvested elsewhere.

Accepting this offer represents a good balance between maximizing profit and minimizing risk."
