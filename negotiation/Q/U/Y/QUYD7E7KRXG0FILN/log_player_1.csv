Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting with an offer of $15,000. This is a good starting point as it's above my minimum value of $10,000, but it leaves room for negotiation if Bob is interested."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $12,000 is better than my minimum, I think I can do better. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

I'm countering with $13,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer, and hopefully, it will be enough to entice him to buy without being too far from my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $11,500 is better than my minimum, I'm still hoping to get closer to my initial asking price. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try one more counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

{""product_price"": 12500}
```

I'm countering with $12,500. This is a small increase from Bob's last offer, but hopefully, it's enough to bridge the gap and secure a deal.  If Bob rejects this, I'll take the $10,000 from John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I've reached a point where the negotiations with Bob are getting tiring, and his offers are getting closer to my minimum.  I'm going to take the $10,000 from John and move on."
