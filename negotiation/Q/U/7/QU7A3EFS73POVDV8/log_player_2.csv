"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

You can do better than $1,150,000.  Since you have the option to buy from John for $1,000,000, you should reject Alice's offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Starting with a counteroffer of $1,050,000 is a reasonable starting point.  This is still a significant profit for Alice ($50,000 over her desired price) and is significantly lower than her initial offer. It's also not too far below your maximum willingness to pay, giving you some wiggle room for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,100,000 is better than Alice's initial offer, it's still not ideal. You can likely negotiate a lower price with Alice, especially given that you know you can get the product for $1,000,000 from John.  Rejecting this offer allows you to continue the negotiation and potentially get closer to your desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1075000}
```

**Reasoning:**

You've shown Alice you're serious about getting a better deal. This counteroffer is still a good profit for her ($75,000 above her desired price), but it moves you closer to your desired price while still leaving some room for negotiation if needed."
