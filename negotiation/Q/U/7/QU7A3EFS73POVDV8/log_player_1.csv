Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1150000} 

This offer is a good starting point because it's significantly higher than Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation. It also positions me to get a higher price than John's offer, if Bob accepts."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low.  While it's higher than his initial value, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to keep negotiating with Bob, as there's still a chance to get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

I'm reducing my offer slightly from the previous round, but still keeping it above Bob's counteroffer. This shows that I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm not willing to compromise my bottom line.  I'm hoping this will encourage Bob to come up a bit more in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While Bob has moved closer to my desired price, his offer is still below my minimum acceptable price.  At this point, it's not clear that we'll be able to reach a mutually agreeable price. I've already received a higher offer from John, so it's in my best interest to take that deal and guarantee my desired profit."
