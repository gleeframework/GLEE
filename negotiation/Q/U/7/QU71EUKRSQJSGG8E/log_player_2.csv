"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $11,500. This is a great deal, considering the value it brings to your life. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $11,500 is a good deal, it's still above Bob's ideal price point. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice, I appreciate it.  While I think this product is great, $11,500 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending right now.  Would you be willing to come down to $10,500?  That's a great price for both of us, and I'm confident we can make this deal work."", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product will bring significant value to your life. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11,000. This is a great compromise, considering the product's worth to you is $12,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is close to Bob's limit:**  $11,000 is only $1,000 over Bob's maximum price of $10,000.
* **Potential for further negotiation is limited:**  Bob's previous counteroffer of $10,500 was rejected. Pushing for a lower price might lead to a stalemate.
* **Cost of John's offer:** Buying from John for $12,000 would be more expensive than accepting Alice's offer.

Therefore, accepting Alice's offer is the best option for Bob, as it allows him to acquire the product at a price close to his limit and avoids the risk of a failed negotiation or a more expensive purchase."
