"Hi Bob, I'm glad you're still interested in the product! I can see that you're willing to go up to $100, and I appreciate that. However, I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $115. It's a fair compromise, and I think you'll be happy with the deal.",115.0,Alice,5,
