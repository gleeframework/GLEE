Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. I'm willing to pay $600,000 for the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
This product is worth at least $1,000,000 to me, and Bob's offer is significantly lower than that. It's too early to accept his offer, and I want to see if we can come to a more reasonable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. While I appreciate your interest, $600,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to negotiate, but I need a price closer to $1,000,000 to make this work.  How about $900,000? Let's find a solution that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we need to find some middle ground here.  I can go up to $700,000, but that's my absolute limit. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000

While $700,000 is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum. I want to see if I can push for a higher price before considering selling to John."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have a limit, but $700,000 is still significantly below what this product is worth to me.  Let's try to meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This is a fair price that considers both our needs. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 850000}
