"Thanks for the offer, Alice! While I appreciate the product, $9,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $7,500. This would be a fair price for both of us and allow me to purchase the product without going over my budget.",7500.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still looking to get a good value for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $8,200. I think this is a fair compromise that takes into account your budget and the product's worth.",8200.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $8,200 is still a little more than I'm comfortable spending. I'm willing to go up to $8,000.  This price aligns with my budget and would allow us to finalize this deal.",8000.0,Bob,4,
