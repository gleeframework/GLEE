"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,700,000. This is a fantastic opportunity to acquire a valuable asset at a price that's still well below its true worth.  While I'm confident in selling it to another buyer for $1,500,000, I'm hoping we can come to an agreement that benefits both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000.
