"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm offering it to you for $100.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $100, which is above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Friendly Tone:** I'm using a friendly tone to establish a good rapport and encourage Bob to engage.
* **Value Proposition:** I'm highlighting the product's potential benefit for Bob. 

This approach balances maximizing my potential profit with maintaining a positive negotiation dynamic."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $100 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to consider $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Counter Offer is Low:** While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still significantly below my desired price.
* **Opportunity for Negotiation:**  I believe there's still room for negotiation. By rejecting his offer, I can counter with a price closer to my desired range.
* **Maintaining Leverage:**  Selling to John for $120 is always an option, but it's best to try to get closer to that price through negotiation.

I'll proceed to the next round with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! I understand $85 is a bit lower than my initial offer.  I'm willing to come down to $95,  which is still a good deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing flexibility by reducing my price, but still staying above Bob's offer.
* **Focus on Mutual Benefit:**  I'm emphasizing that $95 is a ""good deal"" for both of us, highlighting the win-win potential.
* **Maintaining a Positive Tone:**  I'm keeping the conversation friendly to encourage Bob to continue negotiating.

I'm hoping this counteroffer will be more appealing to Bob, moving us closer to a successful deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. Would you be willing to consider $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Closing the Gap:** Bob's offer of $90 is getting closer to my desired price, but it's still not ideal.
* **Potential for Higher Offer:**  I believe there's a chance Bob might be willing to go a bit higher, especially if he sees I'm not immediately jumping at his offer. 
* **Maintaining Leverage:**  I'm still keeping the option of selling to John open, which gives me a strong bargaining position.

I'll reject Bob's offer and make another counteroffer in the next round, aiming for a price closer to $95."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up on the price.  $90 is getting closer, but how about we split the difference at $92.50?  That would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 92.5}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:**  This counteroffer is a clear compromise, showing Bob that I'm willing to meet him halfway.
* **Maintaining a Fair Tone:**  I'm framing the offer as fair for both of us, emphasizing the collaborative aspect of the negotiation.
* **Moving Towards a Deal:** By offering a price slightly above his last offer, I'm hoping to encourage Bob to accept and finalize the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $88? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $88. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $88
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** While Bob's offer of $88 is getting close to my minimum acceptable price ($120), it's still not ideal.
* **Potential for Improvement:**  There's still a chance Bob might be willing to go slightly higher, especially if he's truly interested in the product. 
* **Balancing Risk and Reward:**  Selling to John for $120 is tempting, but there's still a chance I can get a better price from Bob. I need to weigh the risk of losing a potential deal with the reward of a higher price.

I'll reject Bob's offer and counter in the next round, aiming for a price closer to $90."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $88 is just a bit too low for me.  Would you be willing to consider $90?  I'm really confident this product will be worth it for you.  Let's make this deal happen!"", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Push:**  I'm raising the price slightly from Bob's last offer to show I'm not willing to go lower. 
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to him and emphasizing the potential for a mutually beneficial deal. 
* **Closing Tone:**  I'm using a positive, encouraging tone to motivate Bob to accept the offer.

I'm hoping this counteroffer will be the tipping point and Bob will accept, but I'm also prepared to consider selling to John if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not comfortable with $90. Would you be willing to consider $87? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $87. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is Running Out:** We're down to our last two rounds, and Bob's offer of $87 is still below my minimum.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  There's a high risk that Bob will continue to offer lower prices, and with only one round left, I might not be able to reach a satisfactory price. 
* **Guaranteeing Profit:** Selling to John for $120 ensures I get my desired profit and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation.

While I'm disappointed to not make a deal with Bob, the time constraint and the potential for further price reductions make selling to John the most logical decision."
