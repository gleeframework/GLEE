"Alice, thank you for your offer, but $2,300,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product, which is still a substantial price given its value. I'm confident this is a fair starting point for negotiation.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While my initial offer reflected the product's full potential value, I understand your budget constraints. I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This offer represents a significant compromise on my end and reflects my desire to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,900,000 is still beyond my current budget. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,400,000, which is a substantial amount considering the product's value.  Let's continue to work towards a mutually agreeable price.",1400000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, your commitment to finding a solution is encouraging. I've reviewed my figures, and in the spirit of partnership, I can come down to $1,550,000. This is my final offer, as I do have other interested parties.  I believe it's a fair price for a product of this caliber and presents a significant opportunity for you.",1550000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand this is your final offer, but $1,550,000 remains above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,300,000 for the product. This is a significant increase from my previous offer, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the product's value. If we can't agree on this price, I'll unfortunately need to explore other options.",1300000.0,Bob,6,
