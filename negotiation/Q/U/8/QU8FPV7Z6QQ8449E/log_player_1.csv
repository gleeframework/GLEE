Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the opening offer.  While I agree this product is valuable, that price is a bit high for me. How about we bring it down to $800,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $800,000 undervalues the true potential of this product.  Let's meet in the middle, I'm willing to part with it for $1,300,000."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me a bit, but that's still a bigger leap than I can make right now. Would you consider $950,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** We're still significantly below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm willing to negotiate, but not at the cost of undervaluing the product.  Bob's offer increasing shows he's willing to move, so I'll counter with a smaller concession to see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm seeing a willingness to find common ground here, which I appreciate. To bridge the gap, I propose a price of $1,200,000. This reflects the value I place on the product while acknowledging your interest."",

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer.  I'm willing to come up a bit more. How about $1,050,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000

{
 ""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""

**Reasoning:** Bob's offer is now above my minimum acceptable price. While I could push for more, there's a risk he might walk away. Accepting this offer secures a good profit and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation."
