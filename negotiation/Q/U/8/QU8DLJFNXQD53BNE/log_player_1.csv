Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $18,000. It's a great deal and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 18000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$18,000:** This is a starting point that is significantly higher than my minimum value of $12,000. It leaves room for negotiation but also shows that I believe the product is worth a substantial amount.
* **Message:** The message is friendly and positive, emphasizing the value of the product to encourage Bob to consider the offer seriously. 

This strategy aims to:

* **Set a high initial bar:**  This gives me room to negotiate downwards if needed.
* **Show confidence in the product:**  A high initial price suggests you believe the product is valuable, which can influence Bob's perception.
* **Leave room for a win-win situation:** By offering a price that is higher than my minimum, there's potential for both of us to walk away happy."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $14000 for it. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $14,000 is above my minimum acceptable price of $12,000, it's still significantly lower than my initial offer of $18,000. I'm not willing to settle for this price yet. I'm going to try to get closer to my desired price by making a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and I'm willing to negotiate.  However, $14,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and meet at $16,000? This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 16000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm offering $16,000, which is exactly halfway between my initial offer ($18,000) and Bob's offer ($14,000). This demonstrates my willingness to compromise while still trying to get a price closer to my desired value.
* **Message:**  The message emphasizes my willingness to negotiate and highlights that the proposed price is fair for both of us.  This approach aims to encourage Bob to see the value in accepting my counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $16000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $14500 for the product. Can we meet in the middle again? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's counteroffer of $14,500 is getting closer to my desired price range. While it's still lower than my ideal price, accepting this offer would bring in a profit that's significantly higher than selling to John for $12,000. This decision balances the desire for a higher price with the risk of further negotiation potentially leading to a lower or no deal at all."
