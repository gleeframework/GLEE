"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a unique product that I believe will be of great value to you. I'm starting the offer at $15,000.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than my minimum. This allows for negotiation room.
* **Focus on Value:**  I'm emphasizing the value to Bob, implying the price is justified.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  I'm inviting Bob to respond and start the conversation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for offering the product, Alice. I appreciate your generosity. However, my budget allows me to pay no more than $10000 for this item. Would you consider accepting this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** While it's tempting to take the $10,000, it's my minimum.  I'm willing to negotiate further.
* **Potential for a better deal:**  There's a chance Bob might be willing to go higher if he values the product.
* **More Rounds to Explore:**  I have 9 rounds remaining to see if I can get a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  However, this product is truly unique and offers significant value. I'm willing to come down to $12,000 to make this work. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** I'm demonstrating flexibility by lowering my price, showing that I'm serious about a deal.
* **Reasoning:** I'm still highlighting the product's value to justify the price.
* **Meeting in the Middle:** I'm suggesting a price that's halfway between my initial offer and Bob's offer, encouraging him to see the potential for a win-win."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for considering my budget. I would like to propose an offer of $11000 for the product. I hope this meets somewhere in the middle for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Close to My Minimum:** Bob's offer is only $1,000 below my minimum, and I'm willing to take a slight hit at this point.
* **Risk of Losing the Deal:**  If I reject this offer, there's a chance he'll walk away, and I'll be left with the $10,000 option from John.
* **Limited Time:** With only 6 rounds left, it's getting risky to continue negotiating. 

I'm accepting this offer to secure a deal and avoid potential losses."
