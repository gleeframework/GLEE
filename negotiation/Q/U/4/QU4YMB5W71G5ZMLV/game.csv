"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but $900,000 is still a bit higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it.  This is a fair price considering the value we both see in this product. Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $875,000. This is a fair compromise considering the value we both see in this product. What do you think?",875000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $875,000 is still a bit higher than I can go at this time.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $850,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach a deal here.  Let's work together to make this happen.",850000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to work together. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $850,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $875,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value.
