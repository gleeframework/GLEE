Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone like you, and I'm confident it can greatly benefit you. I'm willing to part with it for $1,150,000.  What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Knowing Bob values the product at $1,000,000 and you have a guaranteed sale at $1,200,000, the strategy is to find a price within that range that maximizes your profit. 
* **Strong Opening Offer:** $1,150,000 leaves room for negotiation (if Bob attempts to counter-offer) while still securing a significant gain over your guaranteed sale price. 
* **Positive Messaging:** The message emphasizes the product's value to Bob specifically, increasing the likelihood of acceptance."
