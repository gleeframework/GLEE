{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and think you'd really appreciate it! I'm offering it to you for $135. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 135}
``` 

This offer is a starting point.  I'm aiming to get a price closer to my minimum of $150, but I'm also recognizing that Bob values the product lower. Starting with a price slightly above Bob's value will hopefully encourage him to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I really like the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $125. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting to take the $125 and avoid further negotiation, I'm still hoping to get closer to my minimum of $150.  I'll try to counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate your offer, Bob, but $125 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $130? I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 130}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. How about we meet in the middle at $127.50? That way, we can both feel good about the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $127.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $127.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json

I'm going to sell the product to John for $150.  While I'm getting closer to my target price with Bob,  it's not worth the risk of continuing the negotiation. I'm confident that John will be a good customer, and I'm happy with the price."
