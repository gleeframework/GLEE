Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $140. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

This offer is a bit higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation if he rejects. It also provides a reason for Bob to accept, highlighting the ""great deal"" aspect."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the suggestion, but I was hoping to find the product for a bit less. Would you consider selling it for $130? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $130 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $150. I'm willing to risk a few more rounds of negotiation to see if I can get closer to my goal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $130 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $135.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 135} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I still believe we can reach a better agreement. Could you consider selling the product for $130? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is insistent on $130, which is still below my minimum acceptable price.  While I could continue negotiating, the risk is that we'll go back and forth for a while, wasting time and potentially reducing the final price.  John offers a guaranteed $150, so it's the most sensible option at this point."
