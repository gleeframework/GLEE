"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product that I think you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $10000. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better offer anywhere else. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to get a good deal, Bob, but $8500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $9500. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings to you.",9500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. How about we try $9000?",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see you're still a bit hesitant, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I get a fair price. I can do $9500, but I need you to meet me at $9750. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's a great deal for both of us.",9750.0,Alice,5,

"I can see you're still a bit hesitant, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I get a fair price. I can do $9500, but I need you to meet me at $9800. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's a great deal for both of us. Let's meet in the middle!",9800.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9800 and $9200, which would be $9500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",9500.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I can see you're trying to find a middle ground, Bob, and I appreciate that. However, I've already offered you a price of $9800, and I'm not willing to go any lower than that. I'm willing to meet you at $9800, but I need you to commit to the purchase. If not, I'll have to explore other options.",9800.0,Alice,9,

"I understand that you're not willing to go any lower than $9800, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to make a final offer of $9200, and that's my absolute maximum. If you're not willing to meet me at that price, I'll have to explore other options.",9200.0,Bob,10,
