``` 

This offer starts with a friendly message and sets a price that is higher than your minimum but still leaves room for negotiation.  It's important to leave some room for negotiation, as Bob is likely to try to get a better price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering the product. I'm interested, but I can only pay $120 for it. Looking forward to your response! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json

While Bob's offer is higher than selling to John, it's still below my minimum desired price. I'm willing to negotiate further to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
