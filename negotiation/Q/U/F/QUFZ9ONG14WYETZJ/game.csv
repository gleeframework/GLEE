"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling you this product. I know it holds immense value for you, potentially worth even more than its value to me.  I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair starting point considering its potential benefits for your operations.",1300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,300,000 is still a bit too high for me.  Considering the value you've placed on the product, I'm willing to offer $1,000,000.  This represents a significant price reduction and allows us both to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.  Let's see if we can work this out.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While your offer is generous, I'm aiming for a price closer to my initial offer.  Would you consider $1,200,000? This allows me to make a reasonable compromise while still reflecting the product's true value.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your desire to find a mutually beneficial price, but $1,200,000 is still a stretch for me. Let's split the difference and try $1,100,000. This is a fair compromise that allows both of us to make a good deal. What do you think?",1100000.0,Bob,4,
