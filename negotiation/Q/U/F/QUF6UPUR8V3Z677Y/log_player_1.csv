Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that's worth a lot to me. I'm willing to let it go for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a bit higher than what Bob values the product at, but it's still significantly lower than my minimum price. This allows for some room for negotiation, but I'm still able to potentially make a good profit. I'm also including a friendly message to encourage Bob to consider the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I have to be mindful of my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $9,000 is better than nothing, it's still far below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I will not sell the product for anything less than $12,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer.  While I value your interest, $9,000 just isn't workable for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500, which is still a great deal for you considering the product's value.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 10500} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $10,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $9,500, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than that. Can we meet in the middle at $10,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my target price, Bob's offer of $10,000 is closer to my desired range than his previous offers.  Given that the negotiations have been ongoing, it's likely that continuing to reject and counteroffer may ultimately lead to a lower price or a stalemate. It's better to take the offer now and avoid further potential losses."
