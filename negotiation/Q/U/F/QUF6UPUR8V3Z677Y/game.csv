"I appreciate your time, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I have to be mindful of my budget.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer.  While I value your interest, $9,000 just isn't workable for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500, which is still a great deal for you considering the product's value.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $10,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $9,500, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than that. Can we meet in the middle at $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,4,
