"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000} 
```

I'm starting high, aiming for a significant profit while leaving room for negotiation.  I'm confident the product is worth more than $1,000,000 to me, and I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,200,000 is a decent amount, I believe I can get closer to my desired price. I'll counter with a higher offer in the next round, seeing if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000} 
```

I'm lowering my price a bit from the initial offer, but still aiming for a significant profit.  I'm hoping this counteroffer will be attractive enough to Bob while remaining within a reasonable range for me."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll reject Bob's offer again.  He's not budging on his price, but I'm still confident I can get more. I'll make another counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}

I'm dropping the price a little more, but I'm still aiming for a good profit.  I'm hoping this counteroffer will convince Bob to move closer to my desired price."

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob is clearly not willing to budge much higher. I've lowered my price significantly from my initial ask, and while I'd prefer more, accepting this offer is the most practical choice.  I don't want to risk running out of rounds and being forced to sell to John for a significantly lower price."
