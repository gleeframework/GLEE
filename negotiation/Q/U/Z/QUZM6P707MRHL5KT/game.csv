"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you! I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting our conversation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $900000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you, and I'm open to negotiating to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for this product. However, $900000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. Given the value of the product to me, I'd be willing to pay $850000.  This price reflects a fair compromise, considering the potential benefits for both of us.  Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. However, considering the product's value to me, I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $875000. This price still reflects a significant discount from the initial offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",875000.0,Alice,3,
