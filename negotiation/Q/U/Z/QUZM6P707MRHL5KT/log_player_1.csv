"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for this product. However, $900000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. Given the value of the product to me, I'd be willing to pay $850000.  This price reflects a fair compromise, considering the potential benefits for both of us.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
