This offer starts the negotiation by offering a price slightly above your minimum threshold, but significantly below Bob's estimated value. It leaves room for counteroffers and gives Bob the impression you're willing to negotiate."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1100000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's worth to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I believe I can still get a better deal.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."

Bob's offer is very close to my preferred price, and I don't want to risk losing this deal by pushing for more.  $1,120,000 is a good deal for me and I'll accept it."
