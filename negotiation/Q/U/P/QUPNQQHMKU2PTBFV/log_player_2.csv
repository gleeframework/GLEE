"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $9,500 is better than Alice's initial value of $10,000, Bob can still get the product for $8,000 from John.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try to negotiate a lower price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice,  Thanks for the offer.  I'm really interested in the product, but $9,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'd be willing to pay $8,500 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to get the best possible price, but he also wants to avoid alienating Alice.  Offering $8,500 is a reasonable compromise that shows Bob is serious about buying the product, but is still trying to save money.  This price is halfway between Alice's offer and Bob's maximum price, so it's a good starting point for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you're looking for a good deal.  While $8,500 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This still gives you a good price while ensuring I can make a fair profit.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still determined to get the best deal possible.  While $9,000 is closer to his ideal price, he can still get the product for $8,000 from John.  Rejecting this offer allows Bob to continue negotiating with Alice and try to get closer to his desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  $9,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $8,750. This would allow both of us to come away with a fair deal.  Let's see if we can agree on this price."", ""product_price"": 8750}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to negotiate a lower price but recognizes Alice has also come down in price. Offering $8,750 is a compromise that shows Bob is serious about buying the product, but also signals that he's willing to walk away if Alice doesn't budge further. This price is also a good middle ground between Alice's current offer and Bob's desired price."
