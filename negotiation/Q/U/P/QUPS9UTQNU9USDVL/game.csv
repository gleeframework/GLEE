"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not comfortable with that price.  Given the value of the product to me, I'd be willing to pay $950,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $950,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, though. How about we split the difference and settle on $1,025,000?  This way, we both get a good deal.",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,025,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with, but I'm willing to go up to $975,000.  This is a fair compromise that considers both our positions.",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still not quite there.  $975,000 is close, but I need to be at least at $990,000 to make this worthwhile for me. If you're serious about acquiring this product, I believe this is a fair compromise considering its value to you.",990000.0,Alice,5,
