This offer is a starting point. It's above your minimum threshold and gives Bob some room to negotiate, while still leaving a significant profit margin for you."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to counterpropose a price of $900,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise given its value to both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

``` 

While Bob's counteroffer is closer to my desired price, I believe I can still push for a better deal. I'm going to reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $900,000 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This is a good deal for both of us, and it allows me to earn a reasonable profit. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 950000}
