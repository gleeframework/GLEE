"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for $120. It's a great value considering its worth to you is $150. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $120 is a good deal, you can likely get a better price.  You're willing to pay up to $150, so there's room to negotiate. Rejecting the offer allows you to explore lower prices."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you're providing. However, I'm looking to spend a bit less. How about $100? I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 100}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your budget constraints. Let me propose a price of $110 for the product. This still allows you to save some money compared to its worth to you, while ensuring a fair deal for me as well. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $110 is a good deal. You're willing to pay up to $150, and this price saves you $40. While you could try to negotiate further, there's a risk Alice might reject your offer again, and you could end up paying $150 to John. Accepting the offer guarantees you the product at a price significantly lower than John's."
