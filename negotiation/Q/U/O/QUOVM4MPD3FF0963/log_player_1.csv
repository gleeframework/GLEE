{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product that I think you'd be very interested in. I'm offering it to you for $20,000.  It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity, so let me know if you're interested!  "", ""product_price"": 20000}
``` 

This is a starting point. I've chosen $20,000 as the initial offer, which is higher than my minimum value of $15,000.  I've kept the message upbeat and encouraging.  We'll adjust based on Bob's response and try to get the best possible deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, $20000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to spend right now. I'm really interested in the product, but I'd be comfortable paying $10000 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum value. I'm going to reject his offer and try to negotiate a better price.  I still believe the product is worth more than $10,000 to him."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest!  While $10,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $17,000.  This would still allow me to make a fair profit, and it reflects the value I know this product holds.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 17000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $17000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm happy to meet you in the middle at $13500. This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll still make a decent profit. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum value of $15,000.  While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm not willing to go that low.  It's time to take the guaranteed $15,000 from John."
