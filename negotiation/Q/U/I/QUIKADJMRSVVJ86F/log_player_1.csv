Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value, and while I have another interested buyer, I'd like to give you the first option. I'm proposing a price of $10,000."",
""product_price"": 10000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Since we know Bob values the product at $8,000, starting with a price of $10,000 leaves room for negotiation while aiming for a higher profit margin. 
* **Justification:** The message subtly hints at the product's value and the presence of another buyer, creating a sense of potential loss if Bob declines.
* **Backup Plan:** We have a guaranteed sale at $8,000 to John, so there's limited risk in aiming higher with Bob."
