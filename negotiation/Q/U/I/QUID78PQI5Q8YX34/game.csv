"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this excellent product. I think it would be incredibly valuable to you. Given its features and benefits, I'm offering it at $14,000. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm still not sure it's worth $14,000 to me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $13,000, but I think we can do better than that. Can you consider my offer of $12,500?",12500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you countering and finding a middle ground is important. While $12,500 is a bit too low for me to accept, I'm willing to come down to $13,500.  This product truly delivers exceptional value, and I'm confident you'll be happy with your investment.",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I still think $13,500 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $12,000 and $13,500, as I mentioned earlier. I'm offering $12,750. I'm confident that this is a fair price, and I'm willing to walk away if we can't agree on a price. Can you consider my offer?",12750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position and I'm keen on reaching a deal that works for both of us.  However,  $12,750 is pushing the boundaries of what I can accept. Let's make this simple - $13,125, and I'll close the deal today. This is my final offer.",13125.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to go any higher than $12,000. I've made a serious offer, and I'm willing to walk away if we can't agree on a price. I'm confident that this is a fair price for the product, and I'm not willing to pay more. Can you reconsider?",12000.0,Bob,6,
