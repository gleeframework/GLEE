"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000} 
```

I'm starting with a price of $13,000. This is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation and a potential win-win scenario. It also allows me to assess Bob's interest and negotiation style."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $9,500 is better than nothing, it's still far below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob, hoping to find a price closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000} 
```

I'm reducing my price to $11,000, showing a willingness to compromise while still maintaining a significant profit margin. This counteroffer allows me to gauge Bob's seriousness and potentially move closer to a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob hasn't budged from his previous offer, and I'm still holding out for a better price. I'll continue negotiating to see if I can convince him to pay more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500} 
```

I'm lowering my price again to $10,500. This is a significant concession, demonstrating my desire to reach a deal. It's also a price point that I believe is still profitable for me.  I hope this offer will finally convince Bob to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I've reached a point where I'm no longer confident that I can negotiate a price that's both acceptable to me and agreeable to Bob.  Since I'm getting a very good offer from John,  I'm going to sell the product to him for $15,000. This ensures I receive my minimum desired price and avoids further rounds of potentially unproductive negotiations."
