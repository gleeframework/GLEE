{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. I know it's worth a lot to you, and I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're not giving away the product for less than you value it. 
* **It's below Bob's maximum:** This gives him room to negotiate and feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **It's open to discussion:** The message invites Bob to counter-offer, keeping the negotiation going.

Remember, you can always choose to accept John's offer of $8,000 if you feel like the negotiation with Bob isn't going well."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a price of $8,000 for the product. This aligns closely with its value to me, and I hope this proposal will be acceptable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json

While Bob's offer is the same as John's,  it's worth exploring if we can get a better deal from Bob.  Since he's willing to pay $12,000, there's still room to negotiate a price closer to our desired $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,000 is a bit too low for me.  Considering the value of the product to you, I'm willing to come down a bit further. I'd like to propose a price of $9,500. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident it's a win for both of us. Let's see if we can agree on this."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Alice. I understand your position, and I'm willing to consider it. However, based on my valuation of the product, I would like to propose a price of $9,000. This still allows for a reasonable profit for you while keeping within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $9,000 is very close to our target of $9,500. It's a good deal for both of us and ensures we don't risk losing out on a sale to John."
