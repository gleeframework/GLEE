{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you this incredible product for $1,100,000. It's a steal at this price, considering its value to you. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's slightly higher than the product's worth to Bob, hoping to capitalize on his potential desire for the product. If he rejects it, I'm prepared to negotiate further, but I have a backup buyer in John, so I'm not desperate to sell to Bob at any price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit too pricey. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum price.  I'm not willing to sell for that low of a price, so I will reject his offer and counter with a more reasonable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $900,000 is simply too low.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000? That's a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that $900,000 is a bit low, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,000,000. Can we try to find a middle ground? I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. Can you consider my revised offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob is getting closer to my minimum price,  $950,000 is still below my floor.  I'm going to reject his offer and try to get him to budge just a little more."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $980,000, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to pay $970,000 for the product. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $970,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $970,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer of $970,000 is still below my minimum price, and I'm feeling frustrated with the back-and-forth.  At this point, I'd rather just sell to John and get the $1,000,000. It's not a huge gain, but it's a guaranteed deal and I'm tired of negotiating."
