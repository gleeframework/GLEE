{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering its value to both of us. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum value, leaving some room for negotiation. I'm also being polite and framing it as a fair price, encouraging Bob to consider it seriously."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $800000. I'm willing to pay that price, but I'm not sure I can go any lower. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $800,000 is a significant amount, it's below my minimum value of $1,000,000. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, aiming to secure a price closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $800,000 is a tempting offer, it's unfortunately below my minimum value.  I'm willing to compromise and offer you the product for $950,000. This represents a significant discount from my initial price, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $925000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob's offer of $925,000 is closer to my minimum value of $1,000,000 and represents a significant gain compared to selling to John for $1,000,000.  It's also his final offer, and I'm willing to accept a slightly lower price to finalize the deal."
