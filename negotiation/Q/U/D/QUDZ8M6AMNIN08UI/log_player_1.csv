Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I'm looking to save as much as possible. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,050,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise, considering the product's value and my budget.

Bob's offer:

Bob seems firmly rooted at $1,050,000.  It's unlikely further negotiation will bridge the gap to a price I'm willing to accept. Taking the guaranteed $1,200,000 from John is the best business decision at this point."
