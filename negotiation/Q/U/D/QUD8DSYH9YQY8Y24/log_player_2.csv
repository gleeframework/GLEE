"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As a starting point, I'd like to offer it to you for $800,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value to you is $1,200,000. I'm open to negotiations, but I think this is a fair starting point. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $800,000 is a good deal, but there's still room for negotiation.  Since I have 10 rounds, it makes sense to try to get a better price.  I'm confident I can get closer to my target of $1,000,000 by negotiating further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you recognizing the product's value to me. While $800,000 is tempting, I'm looking to invest closer to $1,000,000.  Let's meet in the middle at $900,000. I believe this price is fair considering the product's potential for both of us."", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not comfortable meeting you halfway just yet. Considering the product's true value to you is $1,200,000, I'm willing to compromise and offer it to you for $950,000. This is a significant discount from the original price, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to my desired price, but I still have room to negotiate. I'm aiming for $1,000,000, and I believe I can get there with a few more rounds of negotiation. I'll counteroffer again to see if we can bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. $950,000 is getting closer to my goal, but I'm still a bit off.  I'm going to offer $925,000. It's a fair price that acknowledges the value of the product while also staying within my budget. Let's see if we can finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 925000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not quite ready to give up on the higher end of the price spectrum just yet. Considering the product's true value to you is $1,200,000, I'm willing to offer it to you for $975,000. This is a small step back from my previous offer, but I believe it's still a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $975,000 is very close to my target of $1,000,000.  While I could keep negotiating, the risk of losing the deal to John, or Alice becoming too stubborn and walking away, is increasing. This price offers a good compromise, saving me $25,000 compared to buying from John.  It's a good deal for both of us."
