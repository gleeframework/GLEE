"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000.

This is a great deal for Bob, but there's always room for a better price.  Let's see if we can squeeze a bit more out of Alice."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer.  $900,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to get closer to $800,000.  It's a significant investment for me, and I want to ensure it's a good value.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 800000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the value of the product. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $800,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $850,000. This is still a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000

$850,000 is a good price, but we can still try to get closer to $800,000. Let's see if we can negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, $850,000 is still a bit too high for me.  How about $825,000?  That's a fair compromise, and it would make this a really attractive deal for me."", ""product_price"": 825000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your desire for a fair compromise, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $825,000. I'm willing to make another concession and offer you the product for $850,000. This is still a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice has been firm on her price, and while we'd love to get closer to our target of $800,000,  $850,000 is still a great deal.  It saves us $350,000 compared to buying from John.  Let's lock it in."
