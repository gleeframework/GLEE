Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the product for $950,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

This is a starting point.  Here's why I chose this price:

* **It's above your minimum:**  You want at least $800,000, so this gives you some room to negotiate.
* **It's below Bob's maximum:** Bob values it at $1,000,000, so he has incentive to negotiate.
* **It shows confidence:** It's not a lowball offer, indicating you believe in the product's worth. 

**Important considerations:**

* **Bob's personality:**  Is he aggressive or more passive?  This might influence your negotiation tactics.
* **Time pressure:** Do you need to sell quickly or can you wait for a better offer?
* **John's offer:**  Remember, you can always go with John for $800,000 if things don't work out with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. I think it's a bit high, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below your minimum:**  You need at least $800,000, and Bob's offer is only $50,000 above that.
* **You have leverage:** You know Bob values the product at $1,000,000, so there's still room for negotiation.
* **John is an option:**  If things don't work out with Bob, you can always go with John for $800,000.

**Next Steps:**

You'll need to send a counteroffer to Bob.  Consider a price slightly higher than his offer, but still below your initial price, to show you're willing to compromise while still maximizing your profit."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $900,000, which is a fair compromise. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** This counteroffer shows you're willing to negotiate while still holding out for a good price.
* **Meeting halfway:** $900,000 is exactly halfway between your initial offer of $950,000 and Bob's offer of $850,000. This signals a willingness to work towards a solution.
* **Still above your minimum:**  This counteroffer remains above your minimum price of $800,000, ensuring a profitable sale. 

**Next Steps:**

* **Analyze Bob's response:**  Will he accept, counteroffer, or walk away?
* **Prepare for more negotiation:**  Be ready to adjust your offer depending on Bob's reaction, but always stay above your minimum.
* **Consider John's offer:**  If things don't work out with Bob, you can always go with John for $800,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant to pay $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers, so I'll offer $875,000. Can we compromise at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Room for negotiation:** You know Bob values the product at $1,000,000, so you can still try to push for a higher price.
* **John's offer is a safety net:** If things don't work out with Bob, you can always sell to John for $800,000.

**Next Steps:**

You'll need to send a counteroffer to Bob.  Consider offering a price slightly above his offer, but still below your previous offer of $900,000.  This shows you are willing to compromise, but you're still aiming for a higher price."

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to go up to $880,000, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at this price?
