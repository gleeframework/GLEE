"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you see in this product. However, $10500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to go up to $8500 for it.  Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more to you than $8500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $9750. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value to you. What do you think?",9750.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, $9750 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm happy to pay $9000 for the product. If you're not comfortable with that, I might need to consider my other options.",9000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $9000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $9500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.
