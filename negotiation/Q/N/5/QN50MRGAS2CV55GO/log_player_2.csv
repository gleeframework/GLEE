Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it is better than her initial asking price, it's still above his maximum value.  He should try to negotiate a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more to you than $8500.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $9000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $9500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.

Bob should buy the product from John. Alice's final offer is still above his maximum value of $8,000, and he's already made several counteroffers.  It's unlikely she will go lower, and he can get the product for his maximum price from John."
