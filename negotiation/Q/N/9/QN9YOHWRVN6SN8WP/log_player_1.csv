""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to sell you this valuable product. Given its potential and value, I'm initially offering it at $2,300,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for a productive negotiation.  What are your thoughts?"",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the opening offer. However, that price is significantly higher than what I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to offer $600,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

""decision"": ""RejectOffer""

Bob's offer is far too low.  We have plenty of room to negotiate and John's offer provides a good safety net."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but $600,000  significantly undervalues the product and its potential. I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000. This offer reflects the true value of this product.  What do you think?"",

```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $2,000,000 is still outside my budget. I can go up to $700,000.  I need to see some movement from your side to make this work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""

While Bob is slowly increasing his offer, we're still far apart. It's time to apply more pressure and see how much he's truly willing to pay."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, the gap between our positions is still substantial.  To show my commitment to finding a solution, I'm willing to offer the product for $1,750,000. This is a significant concession on my end, and I believe it represents a fair compromise. "",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the movement on your end.  To be frank, I have another offer to consider at a lower price.  If I could make this work at $800,000, I'd be prepared to close the deal today.  What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

This is a critical juncture.  Bob has revealed his maximum price, but it's still significantly below our minimum and John's offer. Let's see if we can apply some pressure and get him to budge.  We still have John's offer as a safety net if needed."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have other options, but so do I.  To be completely transparent, I have another buyer ready to close at a higher price.  However, I've enjoyed our conversations and believe in a mutually beneficial deal. I'm willing to accept $1,500,000 for the product.  This is my final offer, and it's a fantastic opportunity to acquire a valuable asset. "",
