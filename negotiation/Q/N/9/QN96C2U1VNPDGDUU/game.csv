"Thanks for the offer Alice, but $11,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying. I'm really interested in this product, though. How about $9,500? That's a fair price for both of us.",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your counteroffer, Bob, but $9,500 is a bit too low for me to consider. This product is very valuable, and I'm confident it's worth the price. How about we meet in the middle at $10,500?",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Okay, Alice, I understand you value the product. I'm willing to go a little higher, but $10,500 is still a bit steep for me. How about $10,000? That's a good compromise and a fair price for both of us.",10000.0,Bob,4,
