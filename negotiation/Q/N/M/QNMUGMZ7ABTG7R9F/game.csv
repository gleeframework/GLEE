"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand you're looking for a better deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $750,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the effort I've put into acquiring it. What do you think?",750000.0,Alice,3,
