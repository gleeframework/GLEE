Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 130}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $130. This is a reasonable starting point, as it's a bit higher than the product's worth to Bob, but still gives him room to negotiate. I'm confident that Bob will counteroffer, and I'm ready to negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $115 is better than nothing, it's below my minimum price of $120. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and counteroffer.  I'll try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 125}
```

I'm going to counter with $125. This is a compromise, as it's in the middle of my minimum price of $120 and Bob's offer of $115.  I believe this is a fair price that gives us both some room to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $118. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $118
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd love to get closer to my original asking price, Bob's offer of $118 is close enough to my minimum price of $120.  I'm accepting his offer to avoid further negotiation and secure a sale."
