"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to make a serious investment in your product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget. Can you meet me at this price?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget concerns, but $900,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1,050,000. This price still allows for a profit for me, while offering you a good value for the product. I'm confident you'll find this to be a fair compromise.  What do you say?",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,050,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $950,000.
