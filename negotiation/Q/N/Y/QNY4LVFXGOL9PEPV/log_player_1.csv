Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm going to sell to John.  We're getting very close to the end of the negotiation, and Bob keeps offering prices that are too low for me. It's getting risky to keep negotiating with him, and I don't want to risk getting stuck with a price that's too low. I'm happy to accept John's offer of $1,200,000, which meets my minimum price."
