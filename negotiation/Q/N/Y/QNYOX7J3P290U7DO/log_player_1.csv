{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe you'd be interested in. I'm asking for $11,500 for it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

This offer is a starting point.  It's higher than Bob's value, but it gives some room for negotiation. If Bob rejects, I'll see if he makes a counteroffer. If his offer isn't good enough, I can always move on to John for a guaranteed $12,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. Would you be willing to consider that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $9,500 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than what I'm willing to accept. I'm going to try to negotiate a higher price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $9,500 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $10,500?  It's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I need. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 10500} 
``` 
 
This counteroffer is a compromise â€“ it's closer to Bob's offer but still above his value. I'm hoping this will encourage him to come up a bit more.  If not, I can always accept John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $9,800? It's the best I can do at this point. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,800 is getting closer, it's still too far below my minimum price.  I'm going to make one more counteroffer to see if we can meet in the middle. If not, I'll go with John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  However, $9,800 is still a bit too low for me. Let's try to split the difference. I'm willing to sell for $10,150.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  It's your final chance to make a deal. If not, I'll have to accept another offer."", ""product_price"": 10150} 
```

I'm offering a price that's halfway between my last offer and his last offer.  This shows I'm serious about making a deal, but I'm also holding firm on my minimum acceptable price. If Bob doesn't accept, I'll go with John's offer."
