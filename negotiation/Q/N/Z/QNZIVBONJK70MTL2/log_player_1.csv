Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I agree this product has potential, but $1,400,000 is a bit steep for my budget. How about we bring it down to $1,100,000? That feels like a fairer starting point. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. While $1,250,000 is closer, it's still a bit of a stretch. How about we split the difference and settle on $1,175,000? I think that's a fair compromise that benefits both of us.
