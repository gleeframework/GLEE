"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. It's truly one-of-a-kind and I believe it holds significant value for your company. My initial offer is $1,400,000. This is a competitive price considering the potential it holds for you. Let's discuss and see if we can reach an agreement.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I agree this product has potential, but $1,400,000 is a bit steep for my budget. How about we bring it down to $1,100,000? That feels like a fairer starting point.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. However, $1,100,000 doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000. This price still allows for significant profit for both of us.  What do you think?",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. While $1,250,000 is closer, it's still a bit of a stretch. How about we split the difference and settle on $1,175,000? I think that's a fair compromise that benefits both of us.",1175000.0,Bob,4,
