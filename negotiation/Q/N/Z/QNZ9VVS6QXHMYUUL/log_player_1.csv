Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1700000}
```

**Explanation:**

* I'm starting with a price higher than what I know the product is worth to Bob. This sets a high starting point for negotiation.
* I'm aiming for a price closer to my minimum value of $1,500,000, but leaving room for potential compromise. 
*  I'm confident in my product's value and believe Bob might be willing to pay more than $800,000 to secure it.

This strategy aims to maximize my potential profit while keeping the negotiation open for a potential deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* Bob's offer is significantly lower than my desired minimum value of $1,500,000. 
* I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob to reach a more favorable price.
* While selling to John for $1,500,000 is tempting, there's still a chance I can secure a better deal with Bob. 
*  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to continue the negotiation and potentially get a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000} 
```

**Explanation:**

* My initial offer of $1,700,000 was rejected, indicating that Bob is not willing to pay that much. 
* I'm lowering my price to $1,400,000, which is still higher than what Bob offered but closer to his price point.
* This counteroffer demonstrates a willingness to compromise while still seeking a price closer to my minimum value. 
* I believe this price is a reasonable compromise and could potentially lead to a successful deal with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

* Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is now significantly below my minimum desired price of $1,500,000.
* Further negotiation with Bob is unlikely to result in a price closer to my minimum value.
* Although I would prefer to get a higher price, selling to John for $1,500,000 guarantees a profit and avoids the risk of further negotiation with Bob.
* At this point, selling to John is the most logical and financially sound decision."
