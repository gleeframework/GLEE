"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $1400000. It's a fantastic deal, considering its value to you.  Let me know your decision, as I have another buyer ready to purchase it for $1200000.  This is a win-win opportunity for both of us! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, it's still above your maximum budget of $1,500,000. Since you have the option to buy from John, rejecting Alice's offer is the best choice.  You can then negotiate with John or potentially find another seller."
