"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $90. This is above what the product is worth to Bob, but it leaves room for negotiation if he's willing to pay a bit more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $75 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $80.  I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 85}
```

I'm counteroffering at $85. This is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway between his offer and my minimum. I hope this will be enough to convince him to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $78. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $78
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $78 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm going to reject this offer.  I'm still holding out for a price closer to $80. John's offer is a backup, but I'm hoping to get a slightly better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 82}
```

I'm lowering my counteroffer to $82. This shows flexibility and a willingness to meet Bob halfway. I hope this will be enough to convince him to accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $79. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $79
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $79 is just a dollar below my minimum acceptable price.  While I'm tempted to try to squeeze a bit more out of him,  I've already gone through five rounds of negotiation. John is guaranteed to pay me $80. With so few rounds remaining, it's not worth the risk of potentially losing both deals. It's time to sell to John and secure my profit."
