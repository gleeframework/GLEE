I'm starting high with $2,000,000. This leaves room for negotiation while still being significantly above my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I want to gauge Bob's interest and see how much he's willing to pay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my minimum, I'm confident I can get more. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm offering $1,900,000. This is a compromise, showing I'm willing to negotiate but still holding out for a price closer to my initial offer. I believe this is a fair price, considering Bob's counteroffer and my own minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While it's lower than I hoped for, it's still above my minimum and a good deal considering the risk of further negotiation. I don't want to risk losing the deal completely and having to sell to John for a lower price."
