Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I'm still a bit above my budget, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $12,900. Can you consider this?

**Reasoning:**

At this point, Bob is very close to our desired price.  Continuing to push for more might make him walk away. Accepting $12,900 is a strong profit above our minimum, and it avoids the risk of him declining further offers."
