It's always a good idea to try and negotiate a better price.  $950,000 is a good start, but there's room to save some money."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
``` 

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer to show Alice I'm serious about getting a good deal. This should open up the negotiation and hopefully lead to a price closer to my target."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $920,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice has come down a bit, but it's still not my ideal price. I'm going to keep pushing for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

I'm increasing my offer slightly, showing Alice I'm willing to meet halfway. Hopefully, this will encourage her to accept."

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice's offer is now only $100,000 above my last counteroffer, and I'm getting closer to my target price.  It's getting risky to keep pushing, as I'm worried about running out of time and having to buy from John. I'm accepting the offer."
