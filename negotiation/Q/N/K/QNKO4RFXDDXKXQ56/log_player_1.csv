Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $19,000. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this price reflects its worth."",
""product_price"": 19000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, you want to see if Bob is willing to pay more. 
* **Starting High:**  A high starting price leaves room for negotiation if Bob counters.  It also establishes a perceived high value.
* **Potential for Negotiation:** The message leaves room for Bob to counter-offer, giving you the opportunity to potentially meet somewhere in the middle while still exceeding your minimum. 

**Important Note:**  This strategy assumes you don't mind potentially losing Bob as a buyer if he's unwilling to negotiate. You're banking on him valuing the product enough to pay a premium."
