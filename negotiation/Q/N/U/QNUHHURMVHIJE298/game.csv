"Alice, that's a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to go as high as $800,000.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position. While I value your interest, $800,000 is simply not enough for me. To make this work, I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000.  This price reflects the product's value and leaves room for both of us to be happy with the deal.  What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $1,200,000 is still too high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000? That's my final offer.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,000,000 doesn't quite cover my costs.  I'm willing to meet you halfway on your last offer, at $1,100,000.  This would give us both a good deal and avoid any further back and forth.  What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,5,
