"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000.  It's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than what the product is worth to Bob, but below my minimum acceptable price. This gives me room to negotiate downwards.
* **Positive Framing:**  I'm emphasizing the value and opportunity for Bob, hoping to create a positive impression. 
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The message clearly indicates I'm open to negotiation, inviting Bob to engage in the process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, that's a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to go as high as $800,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $800,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Room for negotiation:**  There is still room for negotiation. I believe I can achieve a higher price, especially as Bob expressed interest in the product. 
* **Selling to John is a fallback:**  While selling to John for $1,500,000 is a safe option, I want to explore if I can get a better price from Bob.  I have nine rounds left to try."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position. While I value your interest, $800,000 is simply not enough for me. To make this work, I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000.  This price reflects the product's value and leaves room for both of us to be happy with the deal.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer with Justification:** I'm not simply rejecting Bob's offer, but providing a counteroffer with a clear explanation. I'm highlighting the value of the product and showing willingness to compromise. 
* **Moving Closer to Bob's Offer:**  My counteroffer is a significant drop from my initial price, demonstrating flexibility. 
* **Maintain My Minimum:** The offer is still above my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Open for Further Discussion:** I'm ending the message with a question to invite further discussion and negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $1,200,000 is still too high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000? That's my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:**  $1,000,000 is below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **""Final Offer"" is a tactic:**  Bob's statement that it's his ""final offer"" is a negotiation tactic. I won't let it pressure me into a bad deal.
* **Time to counter:**  I still have 6 rounds left, and I'm confident I can achieve a higher price.  

I'll make a counteroffer in the next round, aiming to get closer to my target price."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,000,000 doesn't quite cover my costs.  I'm willing to meet you halfway on your last offer, at $1,100,000.  This would give us both a good deal and avoid any further back and forth.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise and Justification:** I'm demonstrating flexibility by meeting Bob halfway, but I'm still justifying my price by mentioning costs.
* **Avoiding Further Back and Forth:** I'm explicitly stating that this is a good price to avoid further negotiations, hoping to pressure Bob into accepting.
* **Closing the Gap:**  This offer closes the gap between my minimum and Bob's offer, while still maintaining a profit for me.
* **Open for Discussion:** The message ends with a question to invite Bob to respond and potentially close the deal."
