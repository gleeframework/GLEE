"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Given my budget and the value of the product, I'd be willing to offer $1,250,000. What do you think?",1250000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While $1,250,000 is a strong offer, I know the true value of this product is much higher.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,350,000. This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges its worth.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you value the product highly, but $1,350,000 is still a bit more than I can justify right now.  I'm willing to go up to $1,300,000. This is a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident it reflects the value of the product.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
