"Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire this valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its worth to you is $800,000, and I'm willing to make a concession to start the negotiation.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $600,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to sell it to you for $600,000. I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $900,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to you is $800,000, and I'm willing to meet you halfway.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me a bit closer to my price range, but $900,000 is still too far off for me.  Would you consider $700,000?  That feels like a fair compromise.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to find a fair price, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $700,000. I'm willing to make another counteroffer of $850,000. This price is closer to the product's value to me, and I'm willing to compromise to reach a deal.",850000.0,Alice,5,
