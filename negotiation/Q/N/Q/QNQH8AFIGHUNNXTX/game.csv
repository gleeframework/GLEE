"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I appreciate the value of the product, but $22,000 is way out of my budget. I'd be willing to pay $5,000 for it. Let me know what you think.",5000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $5,000 is significantly below its true value.  How about we meet in the middle?  I could let it go for $18,000.",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for coming down a bit. I appreciate your willingness to work with me. However, $18,000 is still a stretch for me. Could you consider $6,500? I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us.",6500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. However, the gap between our valuations is still quite large. I'm willing to consider a lower price, but it needs to be closer to my minimum.  Would you be willing to pay $15,000 for it?",15000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to a price point I can consider. To be completely transparent, my absolute top limit for this is $8,000. If you're willing to work with that, I'm ready to make this deal happen today.",8000.0,Bob,6,
