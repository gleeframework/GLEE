"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you a unique opportunity to acquire [Product Description]. This product has immense potential, and I believe it could be incredibly valuable to you. I'm asking for $1200000 for it. Let me know if you're interested in discussing this further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is exactly the same price as what John is offering.  Since Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible, there's no reason to accept Alice's offer.  Rejecting it allows Bob to potentially negotiate a lower price with Alice or find another seller with a better deal."
