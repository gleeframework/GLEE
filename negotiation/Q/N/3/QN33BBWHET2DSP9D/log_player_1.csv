Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm starting with a high price, knowing it's likely Bob will reject it.  This allows me to gauge his interest and see what he's willing to pay. I'll then adjust my strategy based on his response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is the minimum I'm willing to accept, and selling to John would yield the same amount.  There's no point in risking a lower offer or further negotiation, as I'm guaranteed the minimum desired amount."
