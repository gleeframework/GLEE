{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $175. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, hoping to get a higher price.  I'm also trying to build rapport by highlighting the product's value and suggesting a good deal.  This initial offer is a starting point, and I'm ready to negotiate further depending on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, $175 is a bit steep for me.  I'm really interested in your product, but I can only offer $120 right now.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150. While I'm open to negotiation, I need to stand my ground and reject his offer. I'll proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your interest. While $120 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to come down to $140. This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and it's still a good deal for you. Let me know if you're interested in this offer."", ""product_price"": 140}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $140 is still a little out of my range.  I'm willing to go up to $130.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $130 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still not satisfied with this offer. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I'm not ready to sell for that price just yet. I'll counter Bob's offer again and see if we can find a mutually agreeable price."

I'm willing to meet you halfway at $135.  This would allow us both to walk away with a win.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 135}
