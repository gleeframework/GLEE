"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,250,000. I know it's worth at least that much to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a valuable asset. If you're not interested, I have another buyer lined up, but I'd prefer to work with you if possible. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You should reject Alice's offer.  While she's trying to convince you it's worth more, you know your maximum value is $1,200,000.  Since you can buy it from John for that price, it's smarter to save $50,000 and go with John."
