{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $950,000.  This is a limited-time offer, as I do have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 950000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed sale at $1,000,000, aiming slightly lower with Bob allows room to potentially earn more.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $950,000 is significantly more than Bob's perceived value ($800,000), but the ""exclusive opportunity"" framing and mention of other buyers might make him reconsider. 
* **Time Pressure:** The ""limited-time offer"" adds urgency and might push Bob to act quickly.

**It's a gamble:** Bob might reject this high price. However, it's a calculated risk to try and secure the highest possible profit before going with the guaranteed $1,000,000 from John."
