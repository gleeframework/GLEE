"I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product. I believe it's worth a significant investment for you, and I'm willing to start with a competitive price. I'm offering the product to you for $1,100,000.",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product, that price is a little high for me. I'd be willing to pay $650,000 for it.",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $650,000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $900,000, which is a significant discount from my initial offer. I believe this price still reflects the product's value and is a fair compromise.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $900,000 is closer, I need to be mindful of my budget. I could do $725,000.",725000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you at $825,000, which is a compromise that I think is fair considering the product's value. I'm open to further negotiations, but I need to see some movement from your end.",825000.0,Alice,5,
