"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product, $15,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $10,000, which is a fair price considering the value I place on it. Let's see if we can find common ground.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your perspective on the price. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000? This reflects the product's true value while still being a good deal for you.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $13,000, but I'm still aiming for a price closer to $10,000.  How about $11,000?  That seems like a reasonable compromise given both our perspectives.",11000.0,Bob,4,
