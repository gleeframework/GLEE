"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,300,000 is a bit above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me and allows for a profitable margin for you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your counter-offer. I understand your perspective on the pricing. Considering the true value of this product, particularly how it could benefit your specific needs, I'm proposing $1,225,000. This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges the product's worth while still offering you a good deal.",1225000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,225,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,150,000. This would be a good deal for both of us, allowing me to acquire the product within my budget while still providing you with a profitable sale. Let's find a middle ground.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
