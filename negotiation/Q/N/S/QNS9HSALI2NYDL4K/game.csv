"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the market value and my budget. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price, but $900,000 is simply too low for me to consider at this time.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, however.  How about $1,100,000?  This price still allows for a reasonable profit for me, while also giving you a significant discount from my initial offer.  What are your thoughts?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,100,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'd like to propose $950,000. This is the highest price I'm willing to pay for the product, and I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",950000.0,Bob,4,
