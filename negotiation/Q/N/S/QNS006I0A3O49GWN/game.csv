"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you starting the negotiation. However, $13,500 is a bit high for my budget. Would you consider a lower price, closer to $11,000?",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $11,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we compromise at $12,500? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",12500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you coming down a bit, Alice.  While $12,500 is closer, it's still a little more than I'm comfortable with. Could you consider $11,750?",11750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see you're really interested in the product, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $12,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to go. If you're serious about this, I think we can make a deal at this price.",12000.0,Alice,5,
