"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $9,000. This is a significant markup, but it gives me some room to negotiate if Bob counters. I want to see if he's willing to pay more than the product is worth to him, indicating he values it higher than $8,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $8,500 is better than selling to John, I believe I can push for a better price. I'll reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 8800}
``` 

I'm going to counter with $8,800. This is a slight reduction from my initial offer, but it's still above what Bob is willing to pay and closer to my target price. Hopefully, this will be enough to entice him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,600
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $8,600 is a good compromise. It's closer to my initial offer and significantly better than selling to John. I'll accept the offer to secure the deal."
