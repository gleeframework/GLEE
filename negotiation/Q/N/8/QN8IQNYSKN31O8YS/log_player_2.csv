This is a great deal, considering the product's worth to you is $1,000,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While it's a good deal for Alice, it's not a good deal for Bob. He can get the same product from John for $1,000,000, which is closer to his own valuation."
