"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

There's no reason to accept Alice's offer at this point. You have no information on the product's value to Alice, and you have 9 more rounds to potentially negotiate a better price.  There's also no immediate urgency to buy from John, as his price is the same as Alice's initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming for a 33% discount. This sets the stage for negotiation and allows me to gauge Alice's willingness to compromise. I'm confident that I can secure a better deal than John's offer with some strategic negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still higher than my desired price. I'm confident that with continued negotiation, I can secure a better deal.  I have 7 rounds left and there's no urgency to buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer slightly from the previous round. This shows Alice I'm serious about buying the product but also that I'm not willing to meet her price yet. I'm aiming for a gradual approach to find a middle ground.  I still have 6 rounds to negotiate and I'm not in a rush to accept any offer above my target price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,275,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,275,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting closer to my target range, but I still believe there's room for improvement. I have 5 rounds left, so I can afford to continue negotiating.  There's still no urgent need to buy from John as his price is considerably higher than Alice's current offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm raising my counteroffer again, but only slightly.  This shows Alice I'm willing to compromise and get closer to her price, but I'm not giving in completely yet.  With 4 rounds remaining, I'm still confident that I can secure a better deal."
