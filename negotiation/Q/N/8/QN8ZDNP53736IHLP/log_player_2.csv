Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $120 is still a bit high for you, but $80 is below my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $120 and $80, which is $100. How about that?

It's unlikely Alice will go below $100, and you have a guaranteed option to buy the product for $80 from John.  It makes more sense to take the sure thing at this point and save the extra $20."
