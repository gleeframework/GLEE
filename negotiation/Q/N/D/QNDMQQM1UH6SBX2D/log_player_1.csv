Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

While $12,000 is my minimum, I want to try and get a bit more if possible. I'll counter Bob's offer and see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm going to counter with $13,500. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer, hopefully, we can find a middle ground."

Bob's offer is getting lower than my minimum.  I don't want to risk going any lower, so I'll take John's offer and sell the product to him for $12,000."
