"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,500. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $15,000 to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $14,500 is a good deal compared to John's offer, there's still room for negotiation. By rejecting Alice's offer, Bob can try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested but $14,500 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $13,500. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to get a price closer to his ideal value. By offering $13,500, he's showing a willingness to compromise while still trying to secure a significant saving. This counteroffer leaves room for Alice to negotiate further, while also demonstrating Bob's seriousness in buying the product."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $13,500 is a little too low for me.  How about we split the difference and I offer you the product for $14,000?  It's still a good deal for you, and it gets us closer to a deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $14,000 is still a good deal for Bob. It's lower than John's price and only $500 more than Bob's last counteroffer. Accepting this offer ensures Bob gets the product for a price lower than John's and minimizes the risk of further negotiations potentially leading to a higher price."
