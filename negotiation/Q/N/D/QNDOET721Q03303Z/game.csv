"Alice, your initial offer is a bit high for my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for the product, reflecting its value to me and allowing for a profitable transaction for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1400000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is significantly below what I'm willing to accept. This product has immense value that goes beyond your initial assessment. How about we meet in the middle at $1,750,000?",1750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective on the value of the product, but $1,750,000 is still beyond what I can comfortably afford. I'm willing to go up to $1,500,000, which reflects a fair compromise and allows for a mutually beneficial deal. Let's try to finalize this transaction.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
