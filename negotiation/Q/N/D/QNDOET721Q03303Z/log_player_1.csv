Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your initial offer is a bit high for my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for the product, reflecting its value to me and allowing for a profitable transaction for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is significantly below what I'm willing to accept. This product has immense value that goes beyond your initial assessment. How about we meet in the middle at $1,750,000?"",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your perspective on the value of the product, but $1,750,000 is still beyond what I can comfortably afford. I'm willing to go up to $1,500,000, which reflects a fair compromise and allows for a mutually beneficial deal. Let's try to finalize this transaction. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While I could push for a slightly higher price, Bob's offer of $1,500,000 matches what John is willing to pay. Accepting now avoids the risk of the negotiation failing and ensures I get my minimum acceptable price."
