"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product! I think it's a game-changer and I'm excited to discuss the details with you. As we get started, I'd like to make an initial offer of $1,200,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the value it can bring to your business. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is significantly lower than the product's worth to me ($1,200,000 vs. $1,500,000). I have 10 rounds to negotiate and can still buy from John at a higher price. This makes it worth it to try and negotiate a better deal with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. While I see the potential value, $1,200,000 is significantly lower than what I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to offer $1,400,000 for the product. This reflects a fair compromise considering both our positions."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the initial price, but I still believe the product has significant value to offer. Considering your offer of $1,400,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a counteroffer of $1,300,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value to you, while also acknowledging your concerns about the initial price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's counteroffer is closer to my desired price, I'm still not at a point where I'm comfortable accepting. I have more rounds to negotiate and can still get a better deal with Alice or buy from John as a last resort.  I want to see if I can push Alice further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,300,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,350,000.  I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product while also being within my budget."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to find a balance between the product's value and your budget. However, I'm still not willing to go below $1,350,000. Considering your offer, I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $1,320,000. This is a slight concession from my previous offer, but I believe it still reflects the product's true value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,320,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,320,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,320,000 is getting very close to my desired price.  I've already rejected her previous offer of $1,350,000, and I don't want to risk further negotiation.  At this point, it's better to accept her offer and secure the product.  While I could potentially negotiate a lower price, it's likely that Alice will be less willing to budge and I risk losing the deal completely.  Additionally, I still have the option of buying from John as a fallback, so accepting this offer is a safe choice."
