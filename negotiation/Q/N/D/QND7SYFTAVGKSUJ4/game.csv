"Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product! I think it's a game-changer and I'm excited to discuss the details with you. As we get started, I'd like to make an initial offer of $1,200,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the value it can bring to your business.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. While I see the potential value, $1,200,000 is significantly lower than what I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to offer $1,400,000 for the product. This reflects a fair compromise considering both our positions.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the initial price, but I still believe the product has significant value to offer. Considering your offer of $1,400,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a counteroffer of $1,300,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value to you, while also acknowledging your concerns about the initial price.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,300,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,350,000.  I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product while also being within my budget.",1350000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to find a balance between the product's value and your budget. However, I'm still not willing to go below $1,350,000. Considering your offer, I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $1,320,000. This is a slight concession from my previous offer, but I believe it still reflects the product's true value.",1320000.0,Alice,5,
