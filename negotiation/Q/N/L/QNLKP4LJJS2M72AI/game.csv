"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to acquire a unique product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,000,000. I'm confident this will be a mutually beneficial transaction.",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $2,000,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product, considering its value to me.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1250000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your interest and counter-offer.  While I understand your perspective on the value, the product's inherent qualities and potential benefits warrant a higher price point.  I'm willing to come down to $1,750,000. I believe this reflects a fair compromise.",1750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,750,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm prepared to go up to $1,400,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
