Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $2,000,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product, considering its value to me.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your interest and counter-offer.  While I understand your perspective on the value, the product's inherent qualities and potential benefits warrant a higher price point.  I'm willing to come down to $1,750,000. I believe this reflects a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 1750000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,750,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm prepared to go up to $1,400,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000

While Bob is showing willingness to negotiate, his latest offer is still significantly below John's standing offer.  It's unlikely further negotiation with Bob will bridge that gap quickly enough to be worth the risk."
