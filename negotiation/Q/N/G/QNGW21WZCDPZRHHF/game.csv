"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe will be incredibly valuable to you. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,500,000. What do you think?",1500000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I understand the value of the product, I am currently working within a budget that doesn't allow for such a high price. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $800,000? I hope we can come to an agreement that works for both of us.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you taking the time to consider my offer and for countering. While $800,000 is a significant undervaluation of this product's potential, I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let's settle on $1,250,000, and I believe we have a deal.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your response, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I must respectfully decline the $1,250,000 offer. My budget allows for a maximum of $1,100,000. I hope this revised proposal is acceptable to you.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
