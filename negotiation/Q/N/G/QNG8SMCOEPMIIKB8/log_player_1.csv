Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it will be highly valuable to you.  I'm willing to part with it for $18,000."",
""product_price"": 18000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, you can afford to start with a higher offer to Bob. 
* **Potential for Profit:** Offering the product at $18,000 leaves room for negotiation but still allows you to make a significant profit even if Bob negotiates the price down somewhat.
* **Value Justification:** While not explicitly stating Bob's perceived value ($12,000), the message hints at the product's high value, aiming to influence his perception and justify the high price.

**Important Note:** This is just an initial offer.  Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters. You know your minimum acceptable price is $15,000, so use that knowledge to your advantage in the negotiation."
