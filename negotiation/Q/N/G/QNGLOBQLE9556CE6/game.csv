"Alice,  $1200000 is still way outside my budget. I'm very interested in this product, but I can't go higher than $800000.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $800000 is a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a discount of $200000 from my initial price, bringing it down to $1300000. What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1300000 is still above my budget. I'm really hoping to reach an agreement, so how about $1000000? This is my final offer.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close, but I'm not quite ready to give up on the higher price. I can offer you a compromise at $1150000. This is a significant discount from my initial price, but I believe it's still a fair price for this amazing product. What do you think?",1150000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1150000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm ready to close the deal at $1050000.  This is my final offer before I explore other options.",1050000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go as low as $1050000, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer you a price of $1075000. This is my best and final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",1075000.0,Alice,7,

"I'm starting to think we're getting a bit too close to the minimum price I'm willing to accept. I can offer you a price of $1050000, which is still a bit higher than your last offer. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for this product. Let's see if we can make a deal.",1050000.0,Alice,9,
