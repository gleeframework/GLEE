Round 2

```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $80 just doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to come down to $130.  That's still a great deal for you, and it lets me make a fair profit.  What do you say?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130

# Alice's message: Bob, I hear you.  $90 isn't enough for me, but I want to make this work.  I'm willing to come down to $110. This is a significant compromise, and it would be a fair price for both of us.  Let's close this deal.
