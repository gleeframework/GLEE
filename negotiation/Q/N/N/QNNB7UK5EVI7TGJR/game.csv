"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product, and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm offering it to you for $180.  What do you think?",180.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hey Alice, $180 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in the product, but I can only go up to $80 right now. Let me know what you think.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $80 just doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to come down to $130.  That's still a great deal for you, and it lets me make a fair profit.  What do you say?",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $130 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $90, but that's my absolute limit.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I hear you.  $90 isn't enough for me, but I want to make this work.  I'm willing to come down to $110. This is a significant compromise, and it would be a fair price for both of us.  Let's close this deal.",110.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $110 is still too much for me. I'm really pushing my budget here, but I can go up to $95. This is a fair compromise, and it's the best I can do. Let's close this deal.",95.0,Bob,6,
