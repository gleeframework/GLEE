"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you the chance to acquire a product that is worth significantly more to you than to me. I'm confident that this product will be a valuable asset to your operations, and I'm willing to offer it to you at a price that is fair to both of us. Please let me know if you're interested in discussing this further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, it's still above your maximum budget of $1,500,000.  You can reject Alice's offer and still secure the product from John, albeit at a higher price."
