"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling this amazing product to you. I think it's a great fit for your needs and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a great deal, considering the product is worth $1,000,000 to you. I'm looking forward to hearing back from you! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

While Alice's offer is below your maximum price, it's still a significant markup from what the product is worth to her.  You can likely get a better deal by rejecting her offer. This will lead you to buy from John for $1,000,000, which is still within your budget and potentially motivates Alice to offer a lower price."
