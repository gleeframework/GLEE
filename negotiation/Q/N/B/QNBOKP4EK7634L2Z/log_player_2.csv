"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I am delighted to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this unique product. Given its incredible value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,400,000 is fair. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is still too high, as you are aiming to pay no more than $1,500,000. It is worth exploring if you can negotiate a lower price.  There are 10 rounds available, giving you ample opportunity to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the value of this product, $1,400,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for it, which is a fair price considering my budget and the product's worth.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1,200,000 is significantly below my minimum. This product has immense value that justifies a higher price. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above your target.  You have several rounds remaining, and it's worth trying to get a price closer to $1,200,000. There's a chance Alice might be willing to come down further, especially if she sees you're serious about getting a good deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,350,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to go to $1,250,000. This is a serious offer and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  Let's meet in the middle.  I'm willing to accept $1,300,000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's true value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,300,000 is a reasonable compromise.  You are still saving money compared to buying from John, and you have used several rounds to negotiate.  It's worth accepting this offer to avoid the risk of further negotiations and potentially ending up paying more."
