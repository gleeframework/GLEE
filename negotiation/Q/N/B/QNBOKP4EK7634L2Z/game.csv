"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the value of this product, $1,400,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for it, which is a fair price considering my budget and the product's worth.  What do you think?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,200,000 is significantly below my minimum. This product has immense value that justifies a higher price. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This is my final offer.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,350,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to go to $1,250,000. This is a serious offer and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let's make this deal happen.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
