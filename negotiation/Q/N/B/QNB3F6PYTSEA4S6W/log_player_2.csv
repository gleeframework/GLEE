Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, $7,500 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $7,500 and $10,000, which is $8,750. Let's see if we can make it work. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

**Reasoning:** While Alice is getting closer to a price I'd find acceptable, I can get the product for $8,000 from John right now. It's not worth the risk of further negotiation with Alice when I have a guaranteed option at my target price."
