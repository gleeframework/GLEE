Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but $1200000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $900,000 is still too low for me. I'm confident I can get a better price."

I'm going to sell the product to John. Although I'd prefer to sell to Bob, his offers are still too low for me.  John's offer is much closer to my ideal price, and I don't want to risk further negotiation with Bob that could potentially lead to an even lower price."
