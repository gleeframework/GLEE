"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm asking for $2,300,000. I believe this price reflects the true value you'll gain from it.",2300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I recognize the value of this product, $2,300,000 is above my budget. I'm willing to offer $1,500,000, which is my maximum limit. This price reflects the value I see in the product and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement.",1500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,500,000 is significantly below what I can accept. I'm willing to come down to $2,100,000. This is a very competitive price for a product of this caliber.",2100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $2,100,000 is still out of my price range. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,800,000. This price is a significant increase from my initial offer and demonstrates my commitment to reaching a deal. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the value of the product.",1800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're right, $1,800,000 is closer to what I had in mind.  How about we settle at $1,950,000? That's a fair compromise, don't you think?",1950000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,950,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm prepared to go up to $1,750,000.  This price is a significant increase from my previous offer, and I believe it reflects the fair market value of the product.",1750000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, you've been a pleasure to negotiate with.  Let's find a middle ground.  How about we split the difference and settle at $1,850,000?  This ensures we both feel good about the deal.",1850000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your efforts to find a middle ground. However, $1,850,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,700,000. This is a fair offer considering the value of the product and the progress we've made in our negotiations. I'm confident we can find a mutually agreeable solution at this price.",1700000.0,Bob,8,
