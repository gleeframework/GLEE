"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,300,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000, which I believe is a fair compromise. It still allows you to acquire the product for a price that's below its estimated value to you, while also giving me a return that's closer to my desired target. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your compromise, Alice, but I'm still trying to stretch my budget as much as possible. I'm willing to pay $1,325,000 for the product. I think this price is still reasonable and allows us to meet in the middle.",1325000.0,Bob,4,
