"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,800,000 is fair.  What are your thoughts?",1800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for the offer, but $1,800,000 is a bit too high for me right now. Given the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $1,200,000. This reflects its potential while also allowing for a fair profit for you. Let's see if we can work something out.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While your offer is tempting, I value this product highly.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,500,000? This reflects the true worth of what's being offered.",1500000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you value the product highly, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,500,000 is still more than I'm comfortable with. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $1,200,000. This is a fair price that allows both of us to benefit from the deal. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I respect your position, but I need to be sure this deal truly reflects the value of what I'm offering.  Let's make this our final push - $1,350,000, and we have an agreement.  This is my best and final offer.",1350000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand this is your final offer, and I appreciate you coming down in price. However, $1,350,000 is still a bit higher than what I'm able to pay at this time. I'm willing to go up to $1,300,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I believe it reflects the value of the product.  Let's make this deal happen.",1300000.0,Bob,6,
