"Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is $1,000 less than John's offer.**  This means buying from Alice saves you money.
* **The product is worth $12,000 to Alice,** so she is already making a profit selling to you for $14,000.  You are getting a fair deal."
