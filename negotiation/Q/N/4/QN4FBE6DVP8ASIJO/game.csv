"Alice, thank you for your offer. While I see the value of this product, $1,200,000 is unfortunately out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering my needs and your opportunity to close the deal quickly. Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,200,000 is out of your budget, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering the value it brings to you, and I believe it's a compromise that works for both of us.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,100,000 is still beyond my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $950,000.  This is a significant increase from my previous offer and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product and the fact that I'm ready to buy now.  Let's see if we can make this work.",950000.0,Bob,4,
