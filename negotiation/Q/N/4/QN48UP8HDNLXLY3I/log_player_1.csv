"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product! I'm confident it's worth a lot to you. I'm starting with a price of $150. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price of $150, significantly higher than my minimum value of $100. This gives me room to negotiate downwards. 
* **Positive tone:** I'm using a positive tone and emphasizing the value of the product to Bob. This is meant to encourage him to consider my offer.
* **Open to negotiation:** I'm letting Bob know that I'm open to negotiation, making the offer less intimidating and inviting him to counter. 

**Reasoning:**

This strategy aims to maximize my potential profit by starting high and leveraging Bob's potential interest in the product. It also keeps the door open for negotiation in case Bob's perceived value is lower than expected."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe I can find a better deal elsewhere. I am willing to pay up to $100 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $100 is my minimum value, Bob's offer is a bit too low to be immediately accepted. I'm still confident I can get more, considering my initial offer was considerably higher and I have 8 rounds left to negotiate.  

**Reasoning:**

* **Room for negotiation:**  Rejecting allows for further negotiation and potentially securing a higher price.
* **Potential for higher value:**  Bob might be willing to pay more, especially if he sees the value of the product and understands my starting point. 
* **Avoiding a quick settlement:**  Accepting immediately might signal weakness and limit my potential earnings."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position. While I value the product at more than $100, I'm willing to compromise.  Let's meet in the middle - I'll offer you the product for $125. This gives you a good price and allows me to get closer to my own value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 125}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting in the middle:**  I'm offering a price that's the midpoint between Bob's offer ($100) and my previous offer ($150).  This demonstrates flexibility and a willingness to compromise.
* **Reiterating my value:**  I'm subtly reminding Bob that the product is worth more than $100, but I'm showing a willingness to negotiate. 
* **Positive framing:**  I'm framing the offer as a win-win situation for both of us, emphasizing the good price and the value Bob will receive. 

**Reasoning:**

* **Building momentum:**  By showing flexibility and willingness to compromise, I aim to keep the negotiation moving forward and increase the chances of a successful deal.
* **Testing the waters:**  This offer allows me to gauge Bob's true interest and willingness to pay more than his initial offer. 
* **Maximizing profit:**  While $125 is lower than my ideal price, it's still higher than my minimum and a good compromise point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to counter with a price of $110 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob's counteroffer of $110 is getting closer to my value. Accepting it now avoids further negotiation and the risk of rejection in the following rounds. 

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is valuable:** With only 6 rounds remaining, it's important to consider the time cost of further negotiation.  
* **Minimizing risk:** There's a chance that Bob might get even more stubborn in the next round, potentially forcing me to accept John's offer of $100.
* **Compromise is key:**  A price of $110 is still a reasonable compromise, considering my minimum value and the potential for further negotiation."
