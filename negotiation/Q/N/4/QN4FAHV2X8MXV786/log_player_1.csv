{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd be very interested in. I'm asking for $9,500 for it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a high price point, leaving room for compromise.  $9,500 is a good starting point because it's above your minimum but leaves significant room for Bob to negotiate down if he's interested."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $9,500 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $8,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is my minimum price, I believe there's potential for a better deal.  I'll reject his offer and see if I can negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! $8,000 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down a little. How about $8,750?  It's still a great deal for you, and it's closer to what I need to make this sale worthwhile. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8750}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're looking for a fair price, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $8,375? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,375. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,375
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is close to my minimum, and I'm confident he's not going to go much higher. It's better to secure the sale now and avoid the risk of further negotiation or having to sell to John for a lower price."
