You can do better than $12,000. It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice further."

I'm offering $11,000. This is still a good deal for Alice, as she values the product at $15,000.  It also leaves some room for further negotiation if necessary."

Alice is getting closer to my limit, but I can still try to negotiate a better price.  I'm going to reject this offer and see if I can get her down a bit more."

I'm offering $11,500. This is a compromise between my previous offer and Alice's latest offer.  I'm hoping she sees the value in closing the deal and accepts this offer."

Alice is getting closer to my limit, but I'm not willing to go any higher than $11,500. I'm better off buying the product from John for $10,000. It's not ideal, but it's still a good deal for me."
