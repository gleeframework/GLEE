{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's lower than John's price, there's still room for negotiation. Bob can likely get a better price by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,100,000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a significant discount. Offering $1,100,000 is a bold move, but it's within the range of both parties' valuations.  Alice may be hesitant, but Bob is willing to walk away if she doesn't budge."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,280,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,280,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to Bob's ideal price, he should still reject it.  Bob's initial counteroffer was quite low, so Alice moving down only $20,000 indicates she might be willing to come down further. There's still room for negotiation and Bob should attempt to secure a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,150,000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to meet Alice halfway, increasing his offer by $50,000. This shows that he's serious about negotiating but still wants a significant discount.  This counteroffer is a good compromise, offering a fair price while still leaving room for Alice to make a final concession."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,260,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,260,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $1,260,000, which is very close to Bob's initial counteroffer of $1,150,000.  While Bob might be able to squeeze out a few more thousand dollars by continuing to negotiate, it's likely that Alice won't budge much further.  Accepting the offer at $1,260,000 saves Bob a significant amount compared to buying from John and still represents a good deal.  The risk of further negotiation leading to a stalemate and forcing Bob to buy from John at a higher price outweighs the potential for a slightly lower price."
