"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a fantastic [Product description - briefly highlight its key features]. I'm asking for $10000 for it. This is a fair price considering its value and quality. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save money.  While $10,000 is a good price, Bob can potentially do better. By rejecting the offer, Bob can attempt to negotiate a lower price with Alice.  There's a chance she might be willing to lower the price, especially if she's motivated to sell."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, and I understand the current market conditions.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $8500 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $9250? This would still give you a good deal, and it's closer to my asking price. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,250.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save money. While $9,250 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, it's still higher than Bob's ideal price.  By rejecting this offer, Bob can try to negotiate a lower price again. There's still a chance Alice might be willing to lower the price further."
