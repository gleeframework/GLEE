"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $20,000 for it. What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $10,000 for it. What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest.  $10,000 is quite a bit lower than I was hoping for.  Could you meet me halfway at $15,000?",15000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. While $15,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit above my budget. How about $11,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $11,000 is cutting it too close to my bottom line.  How about we settle at $13,000? That's a significant price drop from my initial offer and meets you closer to your budget.",13000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $13,000 is tempting, but I'm really trying to stay closer to $11,500.  Would you be willing to meet me there?",11500.0,Bob,6,
