Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $10,000 for it. What do you think?

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your interest.  $10,000 is quite a bit lower than I was hoping for.  Could you meet me halfway at $15,000?"", ""product_price"": 15000}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. While $15,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit above my budget. How about $11,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $11,000 is cutting it too close to my bottom line.  How about we settle at $13,000?

Round 6
Bob's offer:
