"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which I believe would greatly benefit you. Given its value and quality, I propose a price of $120 for it. This price reflects not only its worth but also provides you with an excellent opportunity to acquire it at a reasonable premium compared to its intrinsic value of $150. I look forward to your positive response. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

Alice's offer is overpriced. While she claims the intrinsic value is $150, you have an alternative to buy it for $150 from John. By rejecting her offer, you can try to negotiate a better price or proceed with your backup option."
