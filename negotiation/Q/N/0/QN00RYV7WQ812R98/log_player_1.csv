"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,200,000.  This is a significant amount less than what the product is worth to Bob, but leaves room for negotiation.  It's important to start high to maximize my potential profit.  I'll see what Bob's response is and adjust accordingly in the following rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $900,000 is a decent offer, it's still below my desired value.  I want to see if I can push for a higher price.  I'll reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my starting point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

I'm lowering my offer to $1,100,000. This is a significant compromise from my initial offer, but still leaves room for me to profit. Hopefully, Bob will see the value in the product and be willing to meet me closer to the middle ground."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $850,000 is only $50,000 more than John's offer, I still believe I can get a better price from Bob.  I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can push him further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

I'm now offering $950,000. This is a further compromise, but still leaves me with a decent profit.  It's important to meet Bob halfway, but also to ensure that I'm not sacrificing too much value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

The negotiations have been tough and Bob's offers are getting closer to John's offer. While I'm still hoping to get a slightly better price, the risk of continuing negotiations with Bob and losing time is too high. I'm going to sell to John for $800,000, which is still a significant profit for me."
