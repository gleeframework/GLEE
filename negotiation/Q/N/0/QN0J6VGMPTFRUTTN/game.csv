"I have a unique opportunity for you, Bob. I'm willing to sell this exceptional product to you for $9500. It's a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a deal like this elsewhere.",9500.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I'm not sure I can meet your price. I'm willing to pay $8800 for the product. I think that's a fair price considering the market value.",8800.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to make a deal, Bob, but $8800 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $9300. It's a compromise that I think we can both live with.",9300.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but I'm still a bit above $9300. I'm willing to pay $9000 for the product. It's the maximum I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the market value.",9000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but $9000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $9250. It's a fair price that I think reflects the product's value, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal here.",9250.0,Alice,5,

"I'm getting close to my budget, Alice, but I still think $9250 is a bit high. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $9125 for the product. It's the maximum I'm willing to pay, and I hope we can agree on a price.",9125.0,Bob,6,
