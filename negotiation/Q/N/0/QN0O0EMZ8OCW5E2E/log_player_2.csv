"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is still significantly higher than your ideal price and what John is offering. There's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit too high for my budget.  Would you consider $6,000?"",
""product_price"": 6000
}
``` 

This counter-offer is a significant jump down from Alice's offer, but still leaves room for negotiation upwards while staying well below John's $8,000 price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $6,000 is lower than I'd like, I'm willing to come down to $8,500. This takes into account your budget and still allows me to make a reasonable profit. Let's see if we can make this work. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice has come down in price, but her offer of $8,500 is still higher than John's $8,000. There's no guarantee Alice will go any lower, so it makes more sense to buy from John at this point."
