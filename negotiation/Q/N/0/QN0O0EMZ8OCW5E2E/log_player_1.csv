Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer starts at a price that is higher than the value Bob places on the product, leaving room for negotiation. It also frames the price as ""fair"" to make it more palatable to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit too high for my budget.  Would you consider $6,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. While it's tempting to accept $6,000, it's not worth losing out on $6,000 more. I can try to counter-offer Bob and see if we can reach a middle ground.  Selling to John immediately would ensure the maximum profit, but I want to explore if I can get closer to my desired price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $6,000 is lower than I'd like, I'm willing to come down to $8,500. This takes into account your budget and still allows me to make a reasonable profit. Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 8500}
