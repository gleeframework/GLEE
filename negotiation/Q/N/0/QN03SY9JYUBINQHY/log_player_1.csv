Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $14,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($15,000) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $14,000 leaves space for Bob to potentially counter-offer, while still securing a significant profit for Alice.
* **Time Value & Certainty:**  Selling to Bob quickly at $14,000 is preferable to waiting for John's guaranteed $10,000. 

This strategy balances risk and reward, aiming for the highest potential profit."
