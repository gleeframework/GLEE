"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I believe this product presents a unique opportunity and I'm pleased to offer it to you first.  Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with a price higher than your desired outcome. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest and potential counter-offer.
* **Anchoring:** By starting high, we're ""anchoring"" the negotiation around a higher number. Even if the final price comes down, it's likely to stay closer to the initial high point than if we had started low. 
* **Leaving Room for John:** While John offers a guaranteed $1,000,000, there's a chance to get more from Bob.  We don't want to start too close to John's offer and limit our potential profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,300,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is better than John's guaranteed price, but we're still in early rounds. We have room to negotiate and try to close the gap between his offer and our desired outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer.  However, the value of this product is significant and $950,000 falls short of what I can accept. I'm willing to move down to $1,150,000. I believe this price point reflects the true worth of what's being offered."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Show Flexibility:** We've come down from our initial offer, demonstrating willingness to negotiate. 
* **Justify the Price:**  We're reiterating the product's value to counter Bob's lower offer.
* **Strategic Movement:**  The counter-offer is a significant decrease from our initial price, but it's still comfortably above both Bob's offer and John's offer, allowing for continued negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,075,000. Can we meet in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

We're getting closer, but Bob's offer is still below our minimum acceptable price. While it's tempting to take the $75,000 profit over John's offer, we have time to see if we can push a bit further.  There's a risk Bob might not budge much more, but it's worth exploring in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  How about we split the difference between our last offers and land at $1,112,500? This feels like a fair compromise that recognizes the product's value."",
""product_price"": 1112500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** We're signaling a willingness to compromise by suggesting a split-the-difference approach. This can make Bob more receptive.
* **Maintaining Value:**  While we're moving closer to Bob's offer, we're still holding a price point significantly above John's offer, reflecting the product's worth.
* **Time Constraint:**  We're past the halfway point in the rounds, and this offer maintains a balance between pushing for a higher price and securing a deal before time runs out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to go a bit further and offer $1,075,000 again. I think this is the highest I can go without exceeding my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Stalled Negotiation:** Bob has repeated his previous offer, signaling he's unlikely to go higher.
* **Diminishing Returns:** Further negotiation might yield a very small increase (if any) and risks losing the current offer entirely.
* **Time Value:** We're over halfway through the rounds. Continuing might lead to a worse outcome if Bob remains firm or we run out of time.

Accepting $1,075,000 secures a decent profit above John's offer and avoids the risk of ending up with a less favorable deal."
