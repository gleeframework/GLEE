prompt,response
Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $12,000.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $10,000 to Bob. 
* **Your Guarantee:** You have a guaranteed sale of $12,000 to John.

**Strategy**

Since you have a guaranteed buyer at your minimum price, you have leverage.  You should aim for a price higher than Bob's perceived value, but low enough that he might consider it a reasonable deal.

**Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. I'm looking for a price around $11,500. This is a great opportunity to acquire it at a competitive price."",
""product_price"": 11500
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Message:** We create a sense of scarcity and opportunity by mentioning you'll list it publicly. The phrase ""around $11,500"" allows for some negotiation but sets a strong anchor.
* **Price:** $11,500 is a potential sweet spot. It's above Bob's valuation, but the perceived ""deal"" and fear of missing out might persuade him.

**Important Notes**

* **Bob's Response:** How Bob responds will determine your next move. If he negotiates, you have room to go down slightly. If he outright rejects it, you can always fall back on your guaranteed sale to John.
* **Negotiation is Key:**  This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to adjust based on Bob's responses and your own assessment of the situation."
