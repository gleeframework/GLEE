{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500.  I think it's a great deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. This allows for potential counteroffers and ensures you don't immediately go for John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate it, but I believe I can find the product elsewhere for a lower price. However, I am interested in discussing a potential compromise. Would you consider selling the product to me for $10500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is higher than his initial value, it's still significantly lower than what the product is worth to Alice ($12,000).  Rejecting his offer allows Alice to continue negotiating and potentially secure a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $10,500 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $11,000.  This reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair outcome for both of us. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. Considering the value of the product and my budget, I would like to propose a price of $10800. I hope this meets somewhere in the middle for us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to Alice's minimum value, it's still below the $11,000 that Alice is willing to go down to.  Rejecting his offer allows Alice to continue the negotiation and potentially secure a higher price.  Also, remember that Alice has the option to sell to John for $12,000, so she doesn't have to settle for anything significantly lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have a budget, and I'm trying to be flexible. However, I'm not willing to go below $11,000 at this point.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  If you're not willing to meet me at $11,000, then I'll need to explore other options."", ""product_price"": 11000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has rejected Bob's offer twice already, and she's holding firm on her counteroffer of $11,000.  This price is still higher than what Bob is willing to pay, but it's close enough that it might persuade him to accept.  If not, Alice is prepared to walk away and sell to John for $12,000."
