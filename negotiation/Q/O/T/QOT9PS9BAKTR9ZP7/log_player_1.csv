Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $9,500 is a bit too low for me. This product is truly valuable, and I believe $10,000 is a fair compromise. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at that price?"",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, Alice, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go all the way up to $10,000. Would you be willing to consider $9,750? I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not sure I can go any higher. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
``` 

While I could push for $10,000, Bob is clearly hesitant to go that high. Accepting $9,750 is a significant profit compared to John's offer, and it avoids the risk of Bob walking away from the deal entirely."
