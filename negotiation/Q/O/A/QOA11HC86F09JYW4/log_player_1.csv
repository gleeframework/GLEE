Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm selling this product for $175. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the price. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 175}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $175, slightly above what I know the product is worth to me ($150). This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using positive language to encourage Bob to consider the offer.
* **Value Proposition:** I'm subtly hinting at the value of the product without giving away too much information.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The message implies that I'm open to discussing the price further, but I'm starting with a strong offer. 

This approach allows me to gauge Bob's interest and potentially negotiate a price closer to my ideal while still being mindful of his valuation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of the product, but I am only able to pay up to $150 for it. Would you be willing to negotiate further? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is the minimum I'm willing to accept for the product. While I'd prefer to get more, there's no guarantee I'll get a better offer from him in the next round, and I'd rather lock in the sale than risk getting nothing. Selling to John would net me the same amount."
