"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the chance to acquire this truly unique product. Its value is undeniable, and I believe it can significantly benefit you. Given its worth, I'm proposing an initial offer of $1,800,000.",1800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price for this product.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. However, the value of this product is truly exceptional, and $1,200,000 falls significantly short of that.  I could consider coming down to $1,600,000. I believe this is a fair offer that reflects its true worth.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I still think $1,200,000 is a more reasonable price for this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,300,000. I believe that's a fair price that reflects the product's value.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, it seems we're getting closer. While I value your willingness to compromise, $1,300,000 still undervalues the unique benefits this product offers. How about we settle at $1,450,000? This demonstrates my commitment to reaching a mutually beneficial agreement.",1450000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not convinced that the product is worth $1,450,000. I'm willing to go up to $1,300,000, but no higher. I think that's a fair price that reflects the product's value.",1300000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I've been flexible and tried to find common ground, but I have another interested buyer who sees the true value of this product. I'm prepared to close a deal with them at my minimum price. To be fair, I'll offer you one last chance to secure this for yourself at $1,375,000. This is my final offer.",1375000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I understand that you have another interested buyer, but I'm still not willing to go above $1,300,000. I'd like to reiterate my previous offer of $1,300,000. I'm willing to walk away if you're not willing to meet me at this price.",1300000.0,Bob,8,
