"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which is tailored to meet your specific needs. Given its value to you, I believe it's worth every penny of the $12,000 you estimate its worth. However, considering my costs and aiming to achieve a fair profit, I propose we discuss a price that is beneficial for both parties. Would you be open to discussing a price point that might be slightly below your valuation but still significantly higher than what others might offer? Let's aim for a compromise that respects the value you see in this product. Looking forward to your response.",10500.0,Alice,1,
