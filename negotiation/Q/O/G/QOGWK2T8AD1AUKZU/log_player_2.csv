Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm still not comfortable going as low as $110. I think the product's value is worth more than that. How about we try $127? It's a slight increase from my previous offer, but I think it's still a fair price.

Alice is very unlikely to go much lower than $125.  It's not worth risking the $150 from John for a savings of only a few dollars."
