,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,800,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,500,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the market conditions.",1500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. While I recognize your perspective on the price, the value of this product is truly unique.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,700,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and potential returns.",1700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $1,700,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering $1,350,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value and the market conditions.",1350000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position, but I need to be realistic about the product's value.  I'm willing to accept a final offer of $1,550,000. This is a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair deal for both of us.",1550000.0,Alice,5,
