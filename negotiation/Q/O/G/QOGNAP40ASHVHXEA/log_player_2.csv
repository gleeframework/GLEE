"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900000. It's a great deal for both of us, as you know it's worth at least $800000 to you.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is lower than the product's true value, it's still higher than Bob's maximum budget. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $900,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $875000.  This is a fair compromise that still reflects the value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $875,000 is still within Bob's budget of $800,000, but it's a significant improvement from her initial offer of $900,000.  It's a good compromise, and Bob is likely to save more money by accepting this offer than by continuing to negotiate or buying from John."
