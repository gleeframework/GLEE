"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer! I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Can you meet me at that price?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm afraid I can't meet you at $90. I can offer you a compromise at $110. It's the lowest I can go, but I think it's still a great deal for you.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand that $110 is a compromise for you, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $100. Can you consider that?",100.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go as low as $100. I can offer you a slight discount at $108, which is the lowest I'm willing to go. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love the product!",108.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $108 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $105, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at that price?",105.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm glad we're getting close to a deal! I can see you're really interested in the product, and I'm willing to make one more concession. I can meet you at $107, which is my absolute final offer. Let me know if that works for you.",107.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to make one more concession, but $107 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $105, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at that price?",105.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I've already offered you $107, and you've come back with $105. I'm starting to think we're getting stuck in a loop. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to think about what's fair. I can offer you $106, but that's as low as I can go. Let me know if that's acceptable to you.",106.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to make one more concession, but $106 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $105 and $106, which would be $105.50. Can you consider that?",105.5,Bob,10,
