Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $140. It's a great deal for both of us. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

This offer starts by aiming for a price slightly below my minimum, acknowledging that it's a good deal for Bob as well.  It sets a positive tone and leaves room for potential negotiation if Bob wants to counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm really interested, but $140 is a bit higher than my budget. Would you consider $130?  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While $130 is above my minimum, it's still lower than my ideal price. I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob to try and get closer to my desired $140."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! While I'm willing to negotiate, $130 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $135? This would be a fair deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it a great value."", ""product_price"": 135}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $135 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $132. This would be a fair compromise, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $132. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $132
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While $132 is still slightly below my ideal price, I am choosing to accept Bob's offer. This is because:

* **It is above my minimum:**  $132 is above my minimum selling price of $150.
* **Continuing negotiation risks loss:**  There's no guarantee that further negotiation will lead to a higher price.  Bob could potentially walk away, and I risk losing the sale entirely. 
* **John's offer:**  While John is willing to pay $150, his offer is not significantly higher than the current offer. This makes accepting Bob's offer the more pragmatic choice."
