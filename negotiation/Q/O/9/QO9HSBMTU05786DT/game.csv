,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm really interested, but $140 is a bit higher than my budget. Would you consider $130?  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",130.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest! While I'm willing to negotiate, $130 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $135? This would be a fair deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it a great value.",135.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $135 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $132. This would be a fair compromise, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think.",132.0,Bob,4,
