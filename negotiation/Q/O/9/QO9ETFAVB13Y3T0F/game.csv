"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm definitely interested in the product, but $1,150,000 is a little high for my budget. Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and counter-offer.  While $900,000 is a bit too low for me to consider, I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000 to move this deal forward. I believe this price reflects the true value of the product.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thanks for coming down on the price. I'm getting closer to what I can afford, but $1,100,000 is still a bit of a stretch. How about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand where you're coming from, but I have to be firm on this. The value this product brings is substantial, and I'm confident it's worth a premium. How about we settle at $1,075,000? This is my final offer.",1075000.0,Alice,5,
