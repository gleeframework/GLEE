Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be highly valuable to you, and I'm willing to part with it for $17,000. This is a limited-time offer, so please let me know your decision promptly."", ""product_price"": 17000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Value:** You know Bob values the product at $12,000. This information is crucial for setting a price that is appealing but profitable.
* **Aiming High, But Realistic:**  Starting with an offer of $17,000 leaves room for negotiation.  While it's above Bob's perceived value, it might be tempting enough for him to consider, especially if the product offers unique advantages. 
* **Creating Urgency:**  Mentioning a ""limited-time offer"" encourages Bob to make a decision quickly, making it less likely he'll overthink or try to lowball you.
* **Backup Plan (John):**  You have a guaranteed sale at $15,000 from John. This safety net allows you to aim higher with Bob, knowing you have a fallback option. 

**Important Notes:**

* This strategy assumes you have no information about Bob's negotiation skills or willingness to pay more than his perceived value. 
* You might adjust the price slightly lower ($16,000-$16,500) if you prefer a quicker sale and want to increase the chances of Bob accepting immediately."
