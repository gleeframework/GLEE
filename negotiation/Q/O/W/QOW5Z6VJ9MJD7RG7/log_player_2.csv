# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which is worth $150 to both of us. I'm willing to sell it to you for $140, which is a great deal considering its value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:

It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price with Alice.  Even if you don't get it down to your ideal price, you might still save some money."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and I'm glad you find the product valuable. I'd like to counter your offer with a suggestion of $135 for the product. This still allows you to benefit from a good deal while ensuring I receive a fair price for my product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135

Alice has come down to $135, which is a good compromise and within my budget. It's better than buying from John for $150."
