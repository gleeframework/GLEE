"Alice, your initial offer is unfortunately far beyond my budget. I'm very interested in the product, but I can only offer $800,000 at this time. This is the absolute maximum I'm able to pay, as it's close to my limit. I'm hoping we can reach an agreement.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. I understand your position, however, the product's value is significantly higher than what you're proposing. I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000.  This is a considerable reduction and reflects my desire to find a fair deal.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
