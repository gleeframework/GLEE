"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $18,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's starting offer is significantly above your maximum price. It's best to reject and negotiate lower.  Buying from John right now would be giving up on a potentially better deal with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $18,000 is a bit too high for me. I could do $11,000.  What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 11000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  This offer is significantly lower than Alice's but still above your maximum. It sets a strong starting point for negotiation.
* **Leaving Room:**  There's room to negotiate upwards if Alice completely rejects this offer.
* **Polite and Open:** The tone remains friendly and encourages further discussion."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer. However, $11,000 is quite a bit lower than what I'm looking for. How about we meet in the middle at $14,000? This would still be a great deal for you, and it would allow me to get closer to my desired price. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too High:** While Alice moved closer to your range, $14,000 is still above your target and your maximum budget.
* **Room for Negotiation:** Alice's willingness to negotiate suggests there's potential to bring the price down further.
* **Backup Option:**  You still have John's offer as a fallback if negotiations stall."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. I'm getting closer, but $14,000 is still a stretch for my budget.  Could you do $12,500? I think that would be a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 12500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Increase:**  This counteroffer shows willingness to move closer to Alice's price but in smaller increments.
* **Justification:** You re-emphasize your budget limitations to remind Alice of your constraints.
* **Seeking Compromise:**  The language emphasizes finding a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for the offer.  I'm happy to see we're getting closer.  I'm willing to come down to $13,500.  That's a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.  Let's finalize this deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Getting Close, But...** $13,500 is closer to your $10,000 limit, but you can still try to negotiate a bit more.
* **Time Remaining:** You have five rounds left, giving you some leverage to see if Alice will come down further. 
* **Pressure Tactic:** By continuing to reject, you signal that you're serious about getting a lower price and willing to walk away."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  To be honest, $13,500 is still a little more than I was hoping to spend.  I can do $12,800, and that's really pushing my budget. What do you say?"",
""product_price"": 12800
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Smaller Concession:** This counteroffer is a smaller increase than your previous one, signaling that you're reaching the upper limit of what you're willing to pay.
* **Honesty and Transparency:** You're upfront about your budget constraints, which can build trust and encourage Alice to make a final compromise.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  By stating this is ""really pushing your budget,"" you imply this might be your final offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but $13,200 is my final offer.  This is a very fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find the product extremely valuable. Let's close this deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** Alice has stated this is her final offer.  
* **Limited Progress:** You've negotiated down, but Alice is unlikely to move significantly closer to your $10,000 target.
* **Guaranteed Savings:** John offers a guaranteed $3,200 savings. While you might be able to squeeze a tiny bit more from Alice, the risk is likely not worth it.

It's time to cut your losses and go with the guaranteed deal from John."
