Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product! I'm asking for $100 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested in the product, but $100 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $75 for it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I will reject Bob's offer. While $75 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum value of $80. I'll try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. $75 is a little too low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $85? It's still a great deal for you, and it gets me closer to my target."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for being flexible. $85 is getting closer, but I'm still not quite there.  How about $80? I'm really interested in this product, and this is the highest I can go right now. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 

Bob's offer of $80 is my minimum value for the product, and it aligns with what I could get from John. There's no need to continue the negotiation, as I can secure the same price with a guaranteed sale."
