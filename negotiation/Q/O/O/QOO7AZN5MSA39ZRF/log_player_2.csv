"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product! I'm asking for $100 for it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

It's always a good idea to start by rejecting the initial offer, especially when you have a fallback option. By rejecting, you signal to Alice that you're willing to negotiate. This gives you the opportunity to potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested in the product, but $100 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $75 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 75}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Lower:**  We're starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial price, aiming to give us room for negotiation. 
* **Reasonable Offer:** $75 is still a reasonable price, showing Alice that we're serious about buying.
* **Leaving Room:** This offer leaves room for Alice to counter without going below our target price of $100."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest. $75 is a little too low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $85? It's still a great deal for you, and it gets me closer to my target. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $85 is closer to our target, we still have room to negotiate.  Alice is showing flexibility, and we can likely get the price lower by continuing the negotiation. By rejecting, we signal we are still serious about buying, but are not desperate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for being flexible. $85 is getting closer, but I'm still not quite there.  How about $80? I'm really interested in this product, and this is the highest I can go right now."", ""product_price"": 80}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Increment:**  We're only asking for a $5 reduction from Alice's offer, showing that we're getting closer to a deal.
* **Expressing Interest:** We reiterate our interest in the product to keep Alice motivated to negotiate.
* **Setting a Limit:** Stating that $80 is our highest offer creates a sense of urgency and might push Alice to accept."
