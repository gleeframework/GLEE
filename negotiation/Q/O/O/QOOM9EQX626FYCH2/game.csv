"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd love. I'm asking for $110 for it. What do you think?",110.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $110 is a bit steep for me.  How about $95?  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",95.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $95 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $102.50? I'm confident this product is worth it to you, and I'm willing to be flexible.",102.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being flexible.  $102.5 is still a bit high for me.  Let's try $98.50. That's a fair compromise that's closer to where we both need to be.",98.5,Bob,4,
