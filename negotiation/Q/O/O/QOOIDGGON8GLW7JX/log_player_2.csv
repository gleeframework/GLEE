"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a great product that I think you'd be interested in. I'm asking for $120 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","I'd like to reject the offer. The product is too expensive for my budget, and I can get it from John for $20 cheaper.
