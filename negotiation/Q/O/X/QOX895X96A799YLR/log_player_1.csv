Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1150000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above your minimum:**  You're aiming for more than $1,000,000, which is your floor.
* **It's below Bob's value:** Bob is willing to pay $1,200,000, so he has room to negotiate.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** This allows for some back-and-forth without immediately hitting a dead end. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to negotiate further to see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer, but still want to stay above $1,000,000.  I'm hoping this counteroffer is more appealing to Bob, while still being profitable for me."
