"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I'm not willing to sell the product for less than $120. I believe I can get a better price from Bob or John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $100 just doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit though. How about $125?  That gives us both a good deal."", ""product_price"": 125}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I think $112.50 is a more reasonable price. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that amount? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $112.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $112.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I'm still hoping to get closer to my target price. While $112.5 is getting closer, it's still below my minimum of $120. I think I can get a better price from Bob or John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see you're getting closer to my price. How about we split the difference? $116.25 seems fair to me. Let's make a deal."", ""product_price"": 116.25}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $116.25. How about we meet at $110? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $110 is getting closer to my minimum of $120, I'm not yet ready to accept it.  I'm hopeful that with a few more rounds, I can either secure a higher price from Bob or, if necessary, turn to John for a guaranteed $120."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I am too!  How about $115?  That's a fair compromise, and I'm hoping we can finally agree on a price."", ""product_price"": 115}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $108 and $115, which is $111.50. Would you be willing to sell the product to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $111.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $111.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer of $111.5 is tempting, I'm still holding out for a bit more. I'm determined to reach my minimum price of $120, and I have two rounds left to do so."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 9
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're almost there! How about we agree on $113?  That's a fair price, and it means we can finally close this deal.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 113}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really close to my limit, Alice. I'm willing to pay $108 for the product. That's the lowest I'm willing to go. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider buying from John for $120. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $108
(2) Reject Bob's offer 
(2) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

This is a tough one! While $108 is a lot closer than Bob's previous offers, I'm simply out of time to negotiate further. I've reached my final round and Bob has made his final offer, which is still below my minimum.  I'm going to sell to John for $120 to ensure I get at least my minimum profit."
