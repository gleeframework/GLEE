"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth $150 to you, and we're looking to maximize our earnings. Let's start with an offer of $140 for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above my ideal price point of $150. It's worth exploring if I can get a better deal through negotiation.  I'm not desperate to buy right away, so I have time to see if Alice will budge."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I appreciate your eagerness to sell, but $140 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $130 for the product right now.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your response, Bob. I understand your position and would like to make a counteroffer. Considering our goal to maximize earnings, how about we settle at $135 for the product? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $135, which is only $15 above my target price of $120. While I'd prefer to pay less,  it's a good deal considering my other option is to buy from John for $150.  It's also likely that further negotiation will only lead to smaller price reductions, and I'm already in a good position."
