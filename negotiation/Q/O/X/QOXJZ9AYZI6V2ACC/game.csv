"Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product. I'm willing to let it go for $130, but I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us. What do you think?",130.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $130 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $85 for it.  Let me know what you think.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $110. It's still a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $110 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $95, which is a good price for both of us.  Let's make a deal!",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $95 is still below what I need to make this worthwhile.  How about we split the difference and go with $102.50?  It's a fair price, and we can finally get this deal done.",102.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $102.50 is still a bit too much for me.  I'm willing to go up to $98, which is a fair price considering we've both moved closer.  Let's see if we can reach a final agreement.",98.0,Bob,6,
