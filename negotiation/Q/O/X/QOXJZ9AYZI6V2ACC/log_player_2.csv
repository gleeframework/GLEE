"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product. I'm willing to let it go for $130, but I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to get the product for as low a price as possible, ideally under $80. Alice's initial offer of $130 is too high.  Bob should reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $130 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $85 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 85} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $110. It's still a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down in price, $110 is still above Bob's target of $80.  He should continue to negotiate, hoping to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $110 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $95, which is a good price for both of us.  Let's make a deal!"", ""product_price"": 95} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $95 is still below what I need to make this worthwhile.  How about we split the difference and go with $102.50?  It's a fair price, and we can finally get this deal done. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $102.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $102.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to stay under $80. While Alice's offer of $102.5 is better than previous rounds, it's still too high.  He should continue negotiating, aiming for a price closer to his target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $102.50 is still a bit too much for me.  I'm willing to go up to $98, which is a fair price considering we've both moved closer.  Let's see if we can reach a final agreement."", ""product_price"": 98}
