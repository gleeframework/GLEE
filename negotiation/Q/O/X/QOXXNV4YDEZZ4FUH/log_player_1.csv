"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $175.  It's a great deal and I think you'll be happy with it."", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's value to see if I can get him to come up a bit. I'll be watching for his response to decide my next move!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $175 is too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I can only go up to $80. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is way too low.  While I'd like to sell the product, it's not worth it to me at $80. I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can get him to come up in price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. $80 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit to $125.  This is a fair price for both of us.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 125}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  How about $95? That's a fair jump from my previous offer and meets you closer to the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

$95 is still too low for me. It's getting closer, but I'm not giving up on getting a better price.  I'll see if I can get Bob to come up just a bit more in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  $95 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $110?  I'm confident you'll be happy with this product at that price."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm really trying to make this work, but $110 is still a bit too high for my budget.  How about we meet in the middle at $100 even? That would be a fair deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I've decided to sell to John for $150.  It's not ideal to have to give up the potential to get a higher price, but Bob's offer is still too low for me and there aren't many rounds left. It's better to secure the guaranteed $150 from John."
