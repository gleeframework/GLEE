"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $175 is too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I can only go up to $80.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. $80 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit to $125.  This is a fair price for both of us.  Let me know what you think.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  How about $95? That's a fair jump from my previous offer and meets you closer to the middle.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  $95 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $110?  I'm confident you'll be happy with this product at that price.",110.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm really trying to make this work, but $110 is still a bit too high for my budget.  How about we meet in the middle at $100 even? That would be a fair deal.",100.0,Bob,6,
