# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of significant value to you.  I'm offering it to you for $1,200,000. This is a price that reflects the value I place on the product, while also allowing for a mutually beneficial agreement.  I understand you have a high value for this product, and this offer allows you to secure it while still realizing a substantial return on your investment. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000

Here's why:

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:** You can get the product for $1,200,000 from Alice, while John wants $1,500,000.
* **You're saving money:** You're getting a good deal by accepting Alice's offer, even though it's more than Alice's value of the product."
