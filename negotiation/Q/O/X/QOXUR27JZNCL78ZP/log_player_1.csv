Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1450000}
```

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** You want at least $1,200,000, and this offer is significantly higher.
* **It's below Bob's maximum:** Bob values the product at $1,500,000, so he has room to negotiate.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** This offer provides a starting point for negotiation without being too aggressive. 

By offering a price slightly below Bob's perceived value, I'm encouraging him to negotiate and potentially reach a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, I'm still aiming for a higher price. Rejecting his offer allows me to continue negotiating and potentially secure a price closer to $1,450,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1425000} 
```

I'm adjusting my offer slightly lower to $1,425,000. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but still maintaining a price that's closer to my original offer.  It also gives Bob a little more room to maneuver without compromising my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,380,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,380,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is lower than I'd prefer, it's still above my minimum of $1,200,000. Accepting his offer ensures I secure a sale at a reasonable price, and further negotiation might not be worth the risk of losing the deal entirely."
