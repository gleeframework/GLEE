Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $22,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but $10,000 is significantly less than what I'm willing to part with. How about we meet halfway at $16,000?  I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment."", ""product_price"": 16000}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down a bit, but $16,000 is still out of my range.  I'm confident this product has value, but I can't justify that price.  Let's try $12,000.  It's a fair price for both of us, and it gives us a chance to make a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
