"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $22,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but $10,000 is significantly less than what I'm willing to part with. How about we meet halfway at $16,000?  I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down a bit, but $16,000 is still out of my range.  I'm confident this product has value, but I can't justify that price.  Let's try $12,000.  It's a fair price for both of us, and it gives us a chance to make a deal.",12000.0,Bob,4,
