Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your position, Bob, and I've given it careful consideration. To facilitate a successful transaction, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $712500 for the product. This price is a compromise between our previous discussions and represents a fair valuation of the product. I hope this proposal meets your expectations and helps us reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $712,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $712,500

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $712,500 is a very close to your last counteroffer. While you could try to negotiate further, it's likely the gap is small enough that you won't get a significantly better price.  You're in the 7th round, and the risk of Alice walking away increases with each passing round. Accepting the offer secures the product at a good price, saving you a significant amount compared to buying from John."
