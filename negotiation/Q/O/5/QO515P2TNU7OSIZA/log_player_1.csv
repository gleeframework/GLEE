Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before it hits the open market. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. This is a unique opportunity to acquire it at a significant discount compared to what others would be willing to pay."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While selling to John guarantees $1,200,000, there's potential to earn more from Bob. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** The offer of $1,150,000 is:
    * **Above Bob's Value:**  It incentivizes Bob to consider the deal seriously.
    * **Below John's Offer:**  Ensures that if Bob rejects, Alice doesn't lose money.
* **Time Value of Money:** Selling quickly to Bob might be preferable, even with a slightly lower profit, than waiting for a guaranteed sale to John. 
* **""Open Market"" Implication:**  By mentioning other potential buyers, Alice creates a sense of urgency and competition."
