"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product. Can you consider this offer?",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $825,000? This is still a great deal for you, as the product is worth $800,000 to you. Let's try to meet in the middle.",825000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I'm still not convinced that the product is worth $825,000 to me. I'd like to make another counteroffer. I'm willing to pay $775,000 for the product. Can you consider this offer?",775000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $775,000 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again. How about $800,000? This is the absolute lowest I can go, and it's a fair price for a product that's worth that much to you. What do you say?",800000.0,Alice,5,
