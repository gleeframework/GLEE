{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant reduction from Alice's initial price, but still leaves room for a potential compromise. It's likely Alice will be willing to meet somewhere in the middle, especially since she values the product at $80."
