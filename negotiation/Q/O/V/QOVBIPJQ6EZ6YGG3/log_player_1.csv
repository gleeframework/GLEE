"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
```

I'm starting with a price of $120. This is a good starting point as it's significantly higher than my minimum price of $80, but also leaves room for negotiation if Bob is willing to pay more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's higher than my minimum price, it's still significantly lower than what the product is worth to Bob. I'm confident I can get a better price if I continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

I'm countering with $105. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer, and it still gives me a profit margin I'm comfortable with."
