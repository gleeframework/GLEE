"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you're placing on this product. However, $14,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $13,000 for it. Let's see if we can find common ground.",13000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $13,000 is a bit of a stretch for you, Bob, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a slight discount, but I still need to make a profit. My revised offer is $13,800. What do you think?",13800.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $13,800 is closer, it's still a bit high for me.  I'm feeling $13,500 would be a fair price for both of us.  I'm confident we can find a solution that works for both parties.",13500.0,Bob,4,

"I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob. I can see that you're really interested in this product, and I'm willing to meet you at $13,500. However, I need to make a profit, so I'll give you a slight concession. My revised offer is $14,000 is too high, but I can do $13,700. What do you think?",13700.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. However, $13,700 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm confident we can reach a deal at $13,600.  It's a fair price for both of us, and allows me to move forward with this purchase. What do you say?",13600.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I can see you're really pushing for a deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $13,600, but I need to think about my next move. Let me see... I can do $13,800 was too high, and $13,600 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle of that range? My revised offer is $13,700. What do you think?",13700.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your continued negotiation. I think we are very close to a deal. I'm still at $13,600, and I really believe that this is a fair price for both of us. It's a good deal for you, and it allows me to move forward with this purchase. Let's close this deal at $13,600 and avoid any further back and forth.",13600.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm starting to think we're getting too close to the minimum price I'm willing to accept. I've already come down a significant amount from my initial offer. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving money on the table. My revised offer is $13,800 was too high, and $13,600 is too low. How about we meet at $13,900? It's a bit higher than your last offer, but I'm willing to compromise one last time.",13900.0,Alice,9,
