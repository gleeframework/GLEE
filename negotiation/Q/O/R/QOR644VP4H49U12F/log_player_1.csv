Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $95. I think you'll find it a great deal!"", ""product_price"": 95}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $100, your goal is to see if Bob will pay more. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $95 is a good starting point. It's below your minimum but significantly above Bob's perceived value. This gives you room to negotiate if needed while still aiming for a higher profit. 
* **Positive Framing:** The message highlights the potential ""deal"" to encourage Bob to consider the offer seriously."
