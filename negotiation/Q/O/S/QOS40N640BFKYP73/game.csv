"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling this product to you. I believe it holds immense value, and while my minimum selling price is $1,500,000, I'm confident we can reach an agreement that benefits us both. To start the conversation, I propose a price of $1,350,000. What are your thoughts?",1350000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this product has great value, but I'm not sure it's worth the full $1,350,000. Can you consider this price point?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you countering and engaging in this negotiation. While $1,200,000 is a significant investment, I believe the true value of this product is considerably higher. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,275,000. This price reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your perspective. What do you think?",1275000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $1,275,000. I'd like to make a new offer of $1,150,000. I believe this price better aligns with my budget and expectations for the product's value. Can you consider this revised offer?",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but your latest offer is a significant deviation from what I believe the product is worth.  To be frank, I'm prepared to walk away from this negotiation if we can't find a price point closer to my previous offer. My final offer is $1,250,000. This leaves a relatively small gap to bridge, and I believe it's a fair compromise. If this doesn't work, I'll need to explore other options.",1250000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $1,225,000. This is the maximum I'm willing to pay, and I hope we can agree on this price. Can you consider this revised offer?",1225000.0,Bob,6,
