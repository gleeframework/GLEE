,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $11000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'd be happy to buy it for $10500.  Let's see if we can find common ground there.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $11500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit on this deal. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your need to make a profit, but $11500 is still too high for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $10750?  I'm confident this price would be fair to both of us.",10750.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence! I'm willing to meet you halfway on the price, but I still think $11000 is a fair price for this product. However, I'm willing to compromise a bit further. How about we go with $11250? I think that's a reasonable price for both of us.",11250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $11250 is closer to what I'm looking for, it's still a bit high for me.  Would you consider $11000? I think that's a fair price that allows us both to walk away satisfied.",11000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I can see you're really close to making an offer I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to make one final compromise. How about we meet at $11250 is too high, but $11000 is too low. Let's aim for a middle ground. I'm willing to sell it to you for $11500, but that's my final offer. If you're not comfortable with that, I'll have to consider other options.",11500.0,Alice,7,
