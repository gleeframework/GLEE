Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be highly valuable to you. I'm asking for $11,500. Let me know what you think!"",
""product_price"": 11500 
}
``` 
 
 **Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you know Bob values the product at $12,000, aiming slightly below that maximizes your potential profit. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  While the offer is strong, it leaves a small window for Bob to feel like he might be able to negotiate a slightly better deal, increasing the chances of acceptance. 
* **Backup Plan:** You have John as a guaranteed buyer at $10,000, so there's no risk of ending up with nothing.

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes you don't know how much John values the product. If you knew John valued it higher, you could adjust your offer to Bob accordingly."
