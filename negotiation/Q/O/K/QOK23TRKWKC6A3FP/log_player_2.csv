Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While it's better than her initial asking price, there's still room for negotiation and a better deal. Bob can try to get closer to his target price of $1,200,000."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,300,000 is just a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $1,350,000?  This price is still a great deal for you, and it gives me a bit closer to my desired value.  Let's make this happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $1,350,000 is closer to his target price, he can still try to negotiate further. He could counter with a price closer to $1,300,000 or even a slightly higher offer if he feels strongly about getting the product from Alice.  The goal is to continue pushing for a better deal before resorting to buying from John."
