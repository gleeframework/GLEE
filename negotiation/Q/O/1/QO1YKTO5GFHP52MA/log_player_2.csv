"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product which I believe you might find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $110. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. While $110 is within Bob's budget, there's room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $110 is a bit higher than I'm hoping to pay.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd like to offer $95.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming to get a price closer to the middle ground. This is a bold move that might cause Alice to reconsider. If she rejects, Bob can then adjust his offer based on her response."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $95 is a bit too low for me.  Would you consider meeting in the middle at $102? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $102. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $102
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming to save as much money as possible.  $102 is a better price than $110, but it's not the best deal.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $102 is still a little high for me. Let's try $98. That's a good compromise, and I'm confident we can close the deal."", ""product_price"": 98}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is sticking to his goal of saving money, but this time his offer is closer to Alice's. He's also using positive language to encourage a deal. The counteroffer is a small step towards Alice's offer, showing a willingness to compromise."
