{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $10,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point that balances my desire to maximize profit with the need to entice Bob into a negotiation.  It's above Bob's perceived value but significantly below my minimum acceptable price. This strategy allows for potential counteroffers, ensuring a chance to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.  It also keeps the door open to selling to John if Bob rejects the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $6,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is far too low. While I'd prefer to sell to him, accepting his offer would result in a significant loss.  Rejecting his offer allows me to counter with a more acceptable price, keeping the negotiation alive."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $6,500 is lower than I'd hoped, I'm willing to come down to $8,500.  This price is still fair for both of us. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 8500}
``` 
 
I'm countering with $8,500. This offer is a significant increase from Bob's counteroffer but still allows for a reasonable profit for me. It also keeps the negotiation open and potentially leads to a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  How about we meet in the middle at $7,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $7,500 is closer to my minimum acceptable price than Bob's previous offer, it's still below my desired profit margin. I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob, hoping to reach a more favorable price.  I'll counter with a price closer to my preferred range, but I'm prepared to walk away and sell to John if necessary."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, and I appreciate your persistence.  However, $7,500 is still too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $9,000. This price is fair, and I'm confident you'll find it a great value for the product. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

I'm countering with $9,000. This is a significant compromise from my previous offer, but it still allows me to profit from the sale. It's also a strong counter-offer that shows I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm not willing to accept an unfair price. This strategy aims to encourage Bob to accept the offer, while keeping my options open to sell to John if necessary."
