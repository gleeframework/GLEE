"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for you, and it's a fair price considering its value to me. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

You should reject Alice's offer.  You're looking to pay no more than $800,000, and her offer is still too high. It's worth trying to negotiate a better price."

Alice's offer:

You should reject Alice's offer.  While it's a better price than her previous offer, you're still trying to pay no more than $800,000. It's worth seeing if you can get Alice to come down even further."
