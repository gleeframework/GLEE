"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not able to go that high. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a compromise.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000.  This still gives you a good deal, and it's closer to where I need to be. Let's see if we can close this.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $950,000 is getting closer, I'm still looking to stay under $850,000.  How about we split the difference and go with $900,000?  This would be a fair deal for both of us.",900000.0,Bob,4,
