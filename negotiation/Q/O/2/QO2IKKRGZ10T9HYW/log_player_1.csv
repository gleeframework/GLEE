"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be incredibly beneficial for you.  I'm asking for $18,000 to start. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 18000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree this product would be useful, $18,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm thinking something closer to $9,000 would be more reasonable. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is significantly less than what I'm willing to accept. This product offers substantial value, and I believe a price of $15,000 is fair. It reflects the true worth of what you're getting. "", ""product_price"": 15000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand the value of the product, but $15,000 is still too high for my budget.  I'd be willing to go up to $10,500.  That's a significant jump from my last offer and reflects my seriousness about purchasing. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

While Bob is showing willingness to negotiate, his offer is still significantly below my minimum. It's unlikely he'll reach a price point that's acceptable within the remaining rounds. Selling to John guarantees I get my minimum acceptable price."
