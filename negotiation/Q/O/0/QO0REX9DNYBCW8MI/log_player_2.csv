# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're looking to save some money, but $950,000 is a bit too low for me. I can offer you a discount, but I need to make a profit. How about we meet in the middle at $1,025,000?

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $975,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to stay above $1,000,000 to make this worthwhile. How about $1,050,000? That's still a significant saving for you, and it gives me the value I need.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Alice's response:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're getting stuck in a loop. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,050,000 and $990,000, which is $1,020,000. That's the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a fair price for both of us.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm starting to feel like we're getting nowhere.  $995,000 just isn't working for me. I'm willing to go down to $1,025,000 as a final compromise.
