"Thank you for your understanding, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm afraid I need to make a profit, and $10000 is a bit below my minimum. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I can offer it to you for $11500. This is the lowest price I can go, and I hope you'll consider it.",11500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm glad we're able to find some common ground. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go below $12000. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I can offer it to you for $11500, but that's as low as I can go. I think this is a fair price, considering the product's value and my costs.",11500.0,Alice,5,
