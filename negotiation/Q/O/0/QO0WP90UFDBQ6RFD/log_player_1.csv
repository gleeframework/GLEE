Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $160 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to compromise, but I'd like to propose $130. I think that's a fair price for the product.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $130 is a bit too low for me to accept, but I'm willing to make one final offer at $145.  This is the best I can do."", ""product_price"": 145}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're trying to make a profit, but $145 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle again, but I can only go up to $135. That's my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:

While Bob is showing willingness to negotiate, it's unlikely he'll go above his final offer of $135. Accepting that would be a $15 loss compared to selling to John.  It's time to cut my losses and take the guaranteed $150."
