"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I believe this reflects the true worth of what's being offered.",2300000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $2,300,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product, which is still a fair price considering its value to me. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,200,000 significantly undervalues the product's capabilities and potential.  I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000. This offer reflects a more accurate assessment of the value you'll gain.",2000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $2,000,000 is still outside my budget. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $1,200,000.  This price is fair given the value I see in the product, and it allows us both to walk away with a good deal.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
