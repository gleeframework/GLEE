,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $130 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $155?",155.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down.  $155 is still a little high for me.  Let's split the difference - I'll offer $142.50.  I'm very interested in this product and hope we can find a deal.",142.5,Bob,4,
