"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this great product! It's a fantastic deal at $180. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's starting offer is way too high. You know you can get the product for $100 from John, so there's no reason to even consider this offer. It's time to start negotiating downwards."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""That's a bit too steep for me, Alice. How about we meet somewhere in the middle?"",
""product_price"": 80
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  While I'm willing to pay up to $100, I want to start with a significantly lower offer to give myself room to negotiate upwards.
* **Leaving Room to Negotiate:** Offering $80 leaves space to potentially meet Alice closer to my $100 limit if she's unwilling to go that low.
* **Polite but Firm:**  The message aims to be friendly while making it clear that the initial offer is unacceptable."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you want to meet in the middle, but I'm not willing to go that low. How about we compromise at $120? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is coming down, but $120 is still too high. We're getting closer to my $100 limit, but I know I have some bargaining power left. It's worth seeing if I can get her closer to $100 before accepting or going with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down, Alice. I'm willing to stretch my budget a bit, but $120 is still pushing it.  Could you do $95?"",
""product_price"": 95
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Show Progress:** Acknowledging Alice's willingness to negotiate helps maintain a positive tone.
* **Firm but Fair:** $95 is a significant jump from my previous offer, signaling I'm serious about buying but not willing to overpay.
* **Strategic Positioning:** This offer is just below my $100 limit, giving me a little wiggle room if Alice counters again, while still being a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad you're willing to stretch your budget, Bob! However, I'm still not comfortable going that low. How about we meet at $135? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly unwilling to come down to a price that works for me.  Her latest counter-offer of $135 is too far from my $100 limit. It's time to cut my losses and go with my guaranteed option of buying from John for $100."
