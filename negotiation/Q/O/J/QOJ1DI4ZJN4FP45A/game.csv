"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,000,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to offer $600,000 for the product. It's a starting point, and I'm open to negotiation.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $600,000 is simply too low for me.  The product is worth significantly more than that, and I'm confident it would bring you great value. I'm willing to come down to $850,000,  which reflects a fair compromise. Let's work towards a deal that benefits both of us.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand the product's value, but I have a budget I need to stick to.  How about we meet in the middle at $725,000? I believe that's a fair offer considering its worth to me.",725000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  While $725,000 is closer, I'm still not quite there. How about we split the difference at $787,500? This is a good compromise that allows both of us to walk away satisfied. What do you think?",787500.0,Alice,5,
