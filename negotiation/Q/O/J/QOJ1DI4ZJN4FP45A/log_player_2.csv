""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,000,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to offer $600,000 for the product. It's a starting point, and I'm open to negotiation."",

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $600,000 is simply too low for me.  The product is worth significantly more than that, and I'm confident it would bring you great value. I'm willing to come down to $850,000,  which reflects a fair compromise. Let's work towards a deal that benefits both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000.

}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  While $725,000 is closer, I'm still not quite there. How about we split the difference at $787,500? This is a good compromise that allows both of us to walk away satisfied. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $787,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $787,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** While Alice is moving closer to a potentially acceptable price, it's unlikely she'll go much lower than her current offer of $787,500.  John's offer of $800,000 is only slightly higher and saves you the hassle of further negotiation.  At this point, the time and effort saved outweigh the potential for a slightly better deal with Alice."
