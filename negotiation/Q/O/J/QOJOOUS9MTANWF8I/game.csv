"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your enthusiasm.  While I see the value in this product, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'd be willing to offer $1,000,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I need to make a profit, and $1,000,000 is a bit too low for me. Let's meet in the middle at $1,350,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and it's still a great deal for you.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,350,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to come up to $1,150,000.  This is a fair compromise that reflects the value I see in the product while also allowing you to make a good profit.  Let's see if we can agree on this.",1150000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I can see you're serious about this product. However, $1,150,000 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my target. Let's try $1,275,000. This is a fair price that should satisfy both of us, considering the product's value to you and my need to make a profit.",1275000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand we're both trying to find a price that works for both of us.  I'm happy to move closer to your offer, but $1,275,000 is still a bit too high.  Let's try $1,200,000.  This would be a fair compromise, allowing you to make a good profit while still giving me a good deal.  What do you think?",1200000.0,Bob,6,

"I can see you're really close to the value you're willing to pay, Bob. I appreciate your flexibility. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $1,200,000. Let's try $1,225,000. This is a compromise that should be acceptable to both of us, and it's still a great deal for you.",1225000.0,Alice,7,
