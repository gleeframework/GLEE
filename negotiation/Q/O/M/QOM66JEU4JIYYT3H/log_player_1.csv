Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I've considered your latest offer. While I appreciate the reduction, I'm still unable to meet you at $1,100,000. I propose we aim for $950,000 as a compromise.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $950,000 is closer,  I need to stay above $1,000,000 to make this worthwhile for me. Let's meet in the middle at $1,025,000.  This is a fair price that allows for both of us to benefit from this deal."", ""product_price"": 1025000}
