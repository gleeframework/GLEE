"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000} 
```

I'm starting with a high offer, close to Bob's perceived value but leaving room for negotiation.  This allows me to potentially maximize my earnings while still being within a reasonable range for Bob to consider."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $850,000 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get closer to my desired price. Rejecting this offer allows me to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000} 
```

I'm lowering my price slightly from the previous round, acknowledging Bob's counteroffer. This demonstrates flexibility while still staying within a range that's profitable for me.  I believe this offer is attractive enough for Bob to consider while leaving space for potential further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I would prefer a higher price, Bob's offer of $875,000 is getting closer to my desired range.  Considering the limited rounds remaining, I believe it's in my best interest to accept this offer and secure a sale."
