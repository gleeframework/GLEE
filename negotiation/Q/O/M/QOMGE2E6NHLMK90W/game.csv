"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality asset that will bring significant benefits to your business. I'm willing to start the negotiation with a price of $1,200,000.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I recognize the value of this product, $1,200,000 is unfortunately outside of my budget.  I'm willing to offer $850,000,  which is a fair price considering the value I place on this product.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $850,000 is your maximum budget, but I'm afraid I need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my target. My new offer is $1,050,000.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm prepared to offer $900,000, which represents a significant compromise on my end. Let's try to find common ground at this price, as it's getting closer to my maximum budget.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, $900,000 is still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. My new offer is $1,100,000.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your need to make a profit, but $1,100,000 is still too high for me.  To make this deal work, I'm willing to offer $950,000. This is a significant step up from my previous offer, and I believe it reflects a fair compromise given the value of this product to both of us. Let's bridge the gap and reach an agreement.",950000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, $950,000 is still a bit short of my minimum price. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target. My new offer is $1,150,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement at this price.",1150000.0,Alice,7,
