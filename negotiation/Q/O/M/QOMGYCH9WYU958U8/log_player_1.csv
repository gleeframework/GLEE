Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, so you won't accept anything less.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,200,000. 
* **Potential Profit:** There's a potential profit margin of $300,000 ($1,500,000 - $1,200,000) if you can sell to Bob at a price above his valuation.

**Strategy**

You want to aim high to maximize profit, but not so high that Bob automatically rejects your offer.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone with your business acumen. I'm initially proposing a price of $1,450,000. I'm confident this is a fair offer considering the potential return on investment it offers."",
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Strong Opening:** You start by highlighting Bob's business sense, subtly appealing to his ego.
* **High but Reasonable Price:** $1,450,000 leaves room for negotiation while still securing you a significant profit. It's below your guaranteed price but well above Bob's valuation.
* **Focus on Value:**  Instead of dwelling solely on the price, you emphasize the potential return on investment, shifting Bob's focus to the long-term benefits.

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate if Bob counters. You have the leverage of John's offer, but finding a middle ground might be the fastest way to close a deal."
