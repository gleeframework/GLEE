"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. I believe it's a fair price given its value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a price of $12000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. I'm confident I can negotiate a better price with Bob or sell to John for my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $12,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $13,500. This reflects the product's value and gives us both a fair deal. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 13500}
