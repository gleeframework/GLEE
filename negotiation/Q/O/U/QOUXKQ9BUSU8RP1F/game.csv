"I'm very interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $900,000 just isn't workable for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer, how about $1,100,000?  This still leaves room for a fair deal for both of us.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down from your initial offer, but $1,100,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm thinking more along the lines of $950,000. Can you meet me in the middle?",950000.0,Bob,4,
