Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm very interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

I'm not willing to accept Bob's offer of $900,000.  It's too low for me, and I'm confident I can get a better price. I'll counter with a slightly lower price than my initial offer."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest but $900,000 just isn't workable for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer, how about $1,100,000?  This still leaves room for a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down from your initial offer, but $1,100,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm thinking more along the lines of $950,000. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:

I'm still not comfortable with Bob's offer of $950,000. I need to get closer to $1,000,000. I'll see if we can reach an agreement in the next round."

Round 5

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,050,000 is still a bit higher than I was hoping to pay. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $975,000?

I'm still not satisfied with Bob's offer of $975,000. It's still a little too far from my goal. I'm willing to keep negotiating with Bob in hopes of getting a better price."

I've reached the point where I'm concerned that I won't be able to get a better price from Bob. It's getting close to the $1,000,000 floor that I've set for myself. While I'd prefer to sell to Bob, I'm going to take the safe route and sell to John for $1,000,000."
