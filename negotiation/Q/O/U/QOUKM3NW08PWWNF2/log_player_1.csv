"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $18,000. It's a fantastic deal, and I believe you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 18000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's estimated value, but still within a range that might be appealing.  This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Message:** I'm using a friendly and positive tone to encourage Bob to consider the offer.  I'm also highlighting the product's value to create a sense of urgency. 
* **Strategy:**  My goal is to see if I can quickly get close to my desired price. If Bob rejects this offer, I'll adjust my strategy based on his counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer, but $18,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $8,000 for it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price ($15,000).**  I cannot accept his offer.
* **Selling to John for $15,000 is a much better option at this point.** However, I want to explore if I can get a better price from Bob through further negotiation.
* **Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to make a counteroffer and try to bridge the gap.**  I'll need to be strategic in my counteroffer to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your price point. However, $8,000 is far below my minimum asking price. Let's split the difference - I'm willing to come down to $13,000. It's a fair price, and I'm confident you'll find the product to be worth the investment.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** My counteroffer is $13,000, which is halfway between my minimum price of $15,000 and Bob's offer of $8,000. This shows willingness to negotiate but also sets a clear limit.
* **Message:**  I acknowledge Bob's offer but emphasize that it's too low.  I frame my counteroffer as a compromise and highlight the product's value to encourage acceptance.
* **Strategy:** I'm aiming to gauge Bob's flexibility and see if we can reach a deal closer to my desired price. If he rejects again, I'll need to consider selling to John, but I want to exhaust all negotiation options with Bob first."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  $13,000 is still a bit of a stretch for me.  How about we meet in the middle again at $10,500?  That's the highest I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.** While it's closer than his previous offer, it's not a deal I can accept yet.
* **Selling to John for $15,000 is still the most attractive option.**  It guarantees a good return and eliminates the risk of further negotiation that might lead to a lower price. 
* **However, I'm willing to risk one more round of negotiation.**  I'm hoping to push Bob a bit closer to my desired price. I'll make a counteroffer that's closer to his $10,500, but still above my minimum.  If he rejects again, I'll sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position.  I'm willing to come down to $12,000, which is a significant concession. This is a very fair price considering the value of the product. I truly believe it will be a valuable asset for you. Are you willing to meet me halfway on this?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:**  I'm reducing my price to $12,000, which is halfway between my previous offer ($13,000) and Bob's latest offer ($10,500). This shows flexibility and a willingness to reach a compromise. 
* **Message:**  I emphasize the value of the product and the fact that I'm making a significant concession. I'm using a persuasive tone to encourage Bob to accept my offer.
* **Strategy:**  This is likely my last counteroffer before selling to John. If Bob rejects this offer, I will accept John's offer to ensure I don't lose out on the value of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for your continued flexibility.  While the product is valuable, my budget is firm.  I can do $11,000, but that's absolutely my limit. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.**  Although it's close, I've already made significant concessions, and I don't want to risk going any lower.
* **Selling to John for $15,000 is the safest and most profitable option at this point.**  I've already invested enough time and effort in negotiating with Bob, and I'm confident that I can secure a better price from John.
* **Continuing to negotiate with Bob carries a high risk of ending up with a lower price than John is offering.** I don't want to gamble with my minimum acceptable price. 

By choosing to sell to John, I guarantee myself a profit and avoid potentially losing money by continuing to negotiate with Bob."
