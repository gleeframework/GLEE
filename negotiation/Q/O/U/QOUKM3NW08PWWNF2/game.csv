"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer, but $18,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $8,000 for it. What do you think?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your price point. However, $8,000 is far below my minimum asking price. Let's split the difference - I'm willing to come down to $13,000. It's a fair price, and I'm confident you'll find the product to be worth the investment.  What do you say?",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  $13,000 is still a bit of a stretch for me.  How about we meet in the middle again at $10,500?  That's the highest I can go.",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position.  I'm willing to come down to $12,000, which is a significant concession. This is a very fair price considering the value of the product. I truly believe it will be a valuable asset for you. Are you willing to meet me halfway on this?",12000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for your continued flexibility.  While the product is valuable, my budget is firm.  I can do $11,000, but that's absolutely my limit.",11000.0,Bob,6,
