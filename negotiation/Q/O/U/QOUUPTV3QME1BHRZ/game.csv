"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $900000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to spend a bit less.  I'm happy to offer $750000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $750000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $825000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $825000 is still a bit high for me. How about we split the difference and agree on $800000?  That would be a good deal for both of us.",800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $800000 is a good compromise, but I'm not willing to give up too much. I'm willing to meet you at $815000. This is a fair price considering the product's value, and I think it's a good opportunity for both of us to come to an agreement. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",815000.0,Alice,5,
