"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I'd like to get a better deal than $110.",90.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. How about we split the difference and go with $100? That's a fair price for both of us.",100.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to work with me, but $100 is still a bit too high for my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $92. That's the lowest I can go, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",92.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see we're getting closer.  $95 is my final offer. I really want to make this deal work, but I can't go any lower. What do you say?",95.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but $95 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $90, and that's my final offer. If we can't agree on this price, I'll have to consider buying from John for $80.",90.0,Bob,6,
