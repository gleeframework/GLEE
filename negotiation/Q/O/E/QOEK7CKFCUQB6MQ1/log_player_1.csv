Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to spend closer to $10,000. Would you be willing to come down to $10,500?

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While I'm willing to negotiate, $10,500 is too far below my minimum. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer."

While $10,750 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not satisfied. I believe I can get a better price, and I'm willing to continue negotiating."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $10,750 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's meet halfway between our last offers at $10,875. This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be very happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 10875}
