"Round 1

# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $15,000. I'm confident it can greatly benefit you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is far too high ($15,000) compared to my maximum budget of $8,000.  It's not worth accepting this offer. I will reject and counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $15,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,000, which is still a fair price considering the product's value to me. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3

# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your position, but $8,000 is too low for me.  Let's meet in the middle - how about $12,000?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000

Alice's offer of $12,000 is still too high for my budget.  While it's a step in the right direction, I'm determined to get a better price. I'll reject and continue negotiating."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the compromise, but $12,000 is still above my limit. I'm confident we can reach an agreement. I'm willing to go up to $9,500. Let's see if we can close the deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $9,500 is close, but I need to get at least $11,000 for this.  Would that work for you?

While Alice's offer of $11,000 is closer to my budget, it's still too high. I'm determined to get a better price and believe there's still room for negotiation. I'll reject and continue working towards a more favorable deal."
