Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I can see you're making a serious effort to reach a deal. I'm willing to make one last concession, but I need to be careful. I can do $13,000, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. If we can agree on this price, I'm confident we can finalize the sale.

Alice is unlikely to go much lower, and while a deal *might* be reached around $12,500, it's not worth risking missing out on John's $8,000 offer.  It's time to cut bait and secure the product at the guaranteed lower price."
