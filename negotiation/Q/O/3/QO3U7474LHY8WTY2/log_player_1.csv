"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
```

I'm starting with a high price of $18,000. This is above Bob's perceived value, but it leaves room for negotiation and allows me to potentially secure a higher price.  I'm aiming to maximize my profit while still considering Bob's willingness to pay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. While $12,000 is better than nothing, I believe I can secure a higher price through further negotiation.  I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my value in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 16000}
``` 

I'm counter-offering at $16,000. This is a significant drop from my initial offer, but still above Bob's offer and closer to my minimum acceptable price. I believe this is a fair compromise that shows I'm willing to negotiate while still aiming for a good price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer of $13,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below it. I'm not yet at a point where I'm willing to settle for a loss. I'll continue to negotiate with Bob, hoping to reach a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

I'm counter-offering at $15,000. This is my absolute minimum acceptable price, and I believe there's a good chance Bob will accept it.  If he rejects, I can still sell to John for the same price, so I'm not taking a risk by making this offer."
