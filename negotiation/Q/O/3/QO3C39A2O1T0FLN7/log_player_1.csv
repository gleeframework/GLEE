Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the opportunity to purchase the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. I believe this is a fair price, considering the product's value and the market conditions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective on the pricing. However, the value of this product is undeniable, and $750,000 undervalues it significantly.  I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $925,000?"",

}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I still think $825,000 is a more reasonable price. I'm willing to make a serious offer, and I believe this price reflects the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

``` 

While I could push for more, accepting $825,000 is a significant profit over my minimum and avoids the risk of Bob walking away or further negotiation rounds reducing the final price."
