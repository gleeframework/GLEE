Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate and your understanding of the product's value.  To bridge the remaining gap, I'm offering it at $1,450,000.  This is my final offer, as I believe it represents a fair and reasonable price for both of us.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has indicated this is her final offer, and the price of $1,450,000 is still significantly higher than your $1,000,000 limit and John's offer. It's unlikely she'll come down further enough to make a deal worthwhile. You're better off securing the product from John at your target price."
