"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to showcase this exceptional product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm offering it to you at $2,250,000. I believe this price reflects its true worth and the significant return you'll see from it."",
""product_price"": 2250000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  While we know Bob's perceived value is lower,  beginning with a significantly higher price allows room for negotiation and demonstrates confidence in the product. 
* **Justification:** By emphasizing the ""unique value"" and ""significant return,"" we aim to shift Bob's focus towards potential benefits rather than just the initial price.
* **Anchoring:**  This high starting price acts as an anchor. Even though it's likely to be rejected, it sets a reference point for subsequent offers, potentially leading Bob to propose a counteroffer closer to our desired range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for showcasing the product. While I agree it has potential, that price is a little too high for me. I'd be willing to offer $800,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly below both his perceived value and our minimum. Rejecting it is necessary to signal that we're serious about a fair negotiation. We still have ample rounds to negotiate, and selling to John is a good backup plan but not our priority yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you taking the time to consider this. However, $800,000 significantly undervalues the product's potential.  To find a middle ground, I'm willing to offer it at $1,900,000. I believe this price point represents a fair deal for both of us."",
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** While a significant reduction from our initial offer, this counteroffer still keeps us well above both Bob's offer and our minimum price. The sizable drop signals a willingness to negotiate but maintains our position.
* **Finding Middle Ground:** By framing it as seeking a ""middle ground,"" we encourage Bob to reciprocate with a more reasonable counteroffer closer to our desired range. 
* **Reiterating Value:** We subtly remind Bob of the product's potential to justify the price, aiming to shift his focus from the discount to the inherent value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the value you place on the product, but I have budgetary constraints.  I can go up to $950,000.  That's a significant investment on my part and reflects the upper limit of what I'm prepared to spend. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is slowly increasing his offer, but it's still significantly below our minimum. His language suggests he might be willing to go a bit higher.  We are still far from our deadline, and selling to John is a good option but not yet our priority. We will continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to move on the price. To meet you halfway, I'm proposing $1,650,000. This offer reflects my desire to close this deal while ensuring a fair valuation for a product of this caliber."",
""product_price"": 1650000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Movement:**  We're making another substantial drop to signal flexibility and meet Bob closer to the middle ground.
* **Framing the Concession:**  By stating ""to meet you halfway,"" we highlight our compromise and encourage Bob to reciprocate with a significant jump in his next offer. 
* **Deadline Awareness:** While we're not close to the deadline, this concession reminds Bob that we are serious about reaching an agreement soon.
* **Maintaining Value:** We continue to reinforce the product's value to justify the price, hoping to prevent Bob from anchoring too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer, but that's still a significant gap for me. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,100,000. This demonstrates my serious interest in the product while acknowledging the need for a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Progress, But Not Enough:** Bob's offer is finally above his perceived value, which is a positive sign. However, it's still substantially below our minimum acceptable price. 
* **Maintaining Momentum:** Rejecting this offer maintains negotiating tension and encourages Bob to make a more substantial jump in his next offer.
* **Alternative Option:**  Selling to John is becoming increasingly tempting. However, with several rounds left, it's still worthwhile to see if we can secure a deal closer to our target price with Bob."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate and your understanding of the product's value.  To bridge the remaining gap, I'm offering it at $1,450,000.  This is my final offer, as I believe it represents a fair and reasonable price for both of us."",
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** We're getting close to the end of our negotiation window. By presenting this as our ""final offer,"" we aim to instill a sense of urgency and encourage Bob to make a decision. 
* **Strategic Positioning:** This offer is just slightly above our guaranteed sale price with John, representing the minimum we're willing to accept from Bob.
* **Justifying the Price:** We reiterate Bob's understanding of the product's value to subtly anchor his expectations around a higher price point.
* **Leaving Room for John:**  While this is our final offer to Bob, it allows us to walk away and still secure our minimum acceptable price with John if Bob rejects it."
