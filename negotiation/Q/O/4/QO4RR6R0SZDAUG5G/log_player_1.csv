"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for offering me the product, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm. However, given my budget constraints, I am only able to consider offers within the range of $5000 to $7000. I hope we can find a mutually agreeable price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","Since Bob's offer of $6,000 is significantly lower than my initial offer and below the minimum price I'm willing to accept ($12,000), I'll reject his offer and proceed to the next round.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""I understand that you're working with a budget, Bob. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to make a profit.
