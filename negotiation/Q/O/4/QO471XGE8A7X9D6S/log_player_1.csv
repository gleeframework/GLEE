"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $175. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a high price, knowing Bob values it at $80.  This gives me room to negotiate and hopefully earn closer to my minimum of $150."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm really interested in the product, but $175 is a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to pay $85 for it. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $85 is better than nothing, it's far below my minimum of $150.  I'll reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate your interest, $85 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $125. That's still a great deal for you considering the product's value. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 125} 
```

I'm reducing my price to $125. It's a significant drop from my initial offer, demonstrating flexibility. This should hopefully incentivize Bob to consider my counteroffer, while still being above my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $125 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $100. This is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. Let's try to make this work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $100 is closer to my minimum, it's still not a good deal for me. I'll continue to negotiate with Bob, hoping to reach a more favorable price in the next few rounds.  I don't want to sell to John yet, as there's still potential to get a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $100 is still too low.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $112.50. This is a fair compromise that allows us both to reach an agreement. Let's make this deal happen!"", ""product_price"": 112.5}
```

I'm offering $112.50, which is the midpoint between my previous offer and Bob's.  This shows I'm serious about finding a deal, while still staying above my minimum.  Hopefully, Bob will accept this offer."
