"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm really interested in the product, but $175 is a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to pay $85 for it. Let me know what you think.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate your interest, $85 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $125. That's still a great deal for you considering the product's value. Let's see if we can find common ground.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $125 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $100. This is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. Let's try to make this work.",100.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $100 is still too low.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $112.50. This is a fair compromise that allows us both to reach an agreement. Let's make this deal happen!",112.5,Alice,5,
