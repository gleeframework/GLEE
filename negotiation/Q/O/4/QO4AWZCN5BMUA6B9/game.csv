"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking to save a bit, but I'm not willing to go as low as $150. I can offer you a compromise - I'll sell it to you for $180. What do you think?",180.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I can see you're really interested in the product, and I appreciate your persistence. I'm willing to meet you halfway again - I'll sell it to you for $172.50. That's the best I can do, but I think it's a fair price for both of us.",172.5,Alice,5,
