"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $15,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product, as that's my maximum price point.  What do you think?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $15,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $12,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $13,500. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $13,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm sticking with my original offer of $12,000. It's my absolute maximum, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us. Let's make this deal happen!",12000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $12,000 is your absolute maximum, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make another compromise and sell it to you for $13,000. This is my final offer, and I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,5,
