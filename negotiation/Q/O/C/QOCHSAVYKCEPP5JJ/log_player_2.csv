"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $15,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $15,000 is too high, and he can get the product from John for $12,000. It makes sense to try and negotiate with Alice first, as he might be able to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $15,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product, as that's my maximum price point.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $15,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $12,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $13,500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's closer to his desired price, he can still get the product from John for $12,000. It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice further, as she might be willing to go even lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $13,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm sticking with my original offer of $12,000. It's my absolute maximum, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us. Let's make this deal happen!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $12,000 is your absolute maximum, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make another compromise and sell it to you for $13,000. This is my final offer, and I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy from John.  While Alice has lowered her price, it's still higher than what Bob can get from John.  There's a chance Alice might come down further, but at this point, it's a gamble that Bob doesn't need to take. He can get the product for his desired price from John without further negotiation."
