"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you a chance to own this truly unique product. Its value is immense, and I believe it could benefit you greatly.  Given its potential, I'm offering it to you for $1,150,000."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price significantly higher than my minimum ($1,000,000) but below Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000). This leaves room for negotiation while aiming for a highly profitable outcome. 
* **Justification:** I'm subtly hinting at the product's value without revealing my hand entirely. 
* **Leaving Room:** This offer gives Bob the opportunity to negotiate down, which can make him feel more in control of the process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm definitely interested in the product, but that price is a little high for me.  Would you consider $900,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly below both my minimum and his perceived value. While I want to negotiate, accepting this offer would mean settling for far less than what I can get.  It's time to steer the negotiation closer to a more reasonable range.  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, $900,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth and potential.  I'm willing to negotiate, so to find a middle ground, how about we consider $1,075,000?"",
""product_price"": 1075000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Rejection & Justification:** I'm politely rejecting Bob's offer, emphasizing that it doesn't reflect the product's value.
* **Compromise:** I'm moving closer to the middle ground between my initial offer and his counteroffer to show flexibility.
* **Strategic Positioning:** This offer is still significantly above my minimum, keeping me in a strong position. It also applies a bit of pressure by being closer to his perceived value and highlighting the potential for a mutually beneficial deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand this product has value, but I need to be mindful of my budget.  Could we settle somewhere around $975,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is slowly increasing his offers, but we are still too far apart. His offer of $975,000 is getting closer to John's standing offer, but I believe I can still negotiate a better price with Bob.  I'm willing to play hardball for one more round to test Bob's resolve."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm glad we're finding common ground. While your offer is tempting, I value this product at a premium due to its unique nature. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to accept $1,025,000. This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges its true worth."",
""product_price"": 1025000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Positive Tone:** I'm starting with a positive affirmation to keep the negotiation amicable and emphasize progress.
* **Firm Stance:**  While I'm lowering my price, I'm reiterating the product's value and using strong language (""value at a premium,"" ""true worth"") to justify a higher price point.
* **Strategic Concession:**  I'm making a smaller concession this round ($50,000) compared to Bob's increase ($50,000) to signal I'm nearing my bottom line.
* **Time Pressure:** As we are past the halfway point, I'm applying subtle pressure by suggesting this is a final compromise. This might push Bob to make a more significant move or risk losing the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  How about we split the difference and settle at $1,000,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has met my baseline price of $1,000,000. While I could push for a slightly higher amount, there's a risk he'll walk away. Accepting this offer guarantees I get the best possible price without the uncertainty of further negotiation."
