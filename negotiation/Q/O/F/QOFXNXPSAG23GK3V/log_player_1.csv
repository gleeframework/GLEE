"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value of $800,000, but still below my minimum of $1,200,000. This gives me room to negotiate downwards.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a friendly tone and emphasizing the benefits for both of us to create a positive atmosphere for negotiation. 
* **Room for Compromise:**  The offer is not unreasonable, leaving space for Bob to counter without feeling like he's being taken advantage of. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the gesture. I am willing to pay $950,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Offer:** While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below my ideal price.
* **Negotiation Opportunity:** I believe there's still room for negotiation, and I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price.
* **Selling to John:**  Selling to John for $1,200,000 is tempting, but I'm not desperate yet. I'll keep negotiating with Bob, hoping to get a better price.

I'll proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer to Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $980,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's make this deal happen!"", ""product_price"": 980000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-Offer:** I'm making a counter-offer that's closer to Bob's offer but still above his initial price. This shows flexibility while staying true to my desire for a higher price.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm maintaining a positive and encouraging tone to keep the negotiation amicable.
* **Reasoning:** I'm providing a rationale for my counter-offer by emphasizing the value of the product, making it seem more reasonable.

I'm hopeful that Bob will find this counter-offer acceptable and we can close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of your product, but I believe we can reach an agreement closer to $960,000. I hope we can move forward with this transaction. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $960,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $960,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Closing the Deal:** Bob's offer of $960,000 is very close to my desired price. It's within my acceptable range, and I don't want to risk losing him as a buyer.
* **Minimizing Risk:**  While I'd prefer to get closer to $1,000,000, the risk of further negotiation might lead to Bob walking away or me having to sell to John.
* **Time is Money:** We're already in round 4, and every round wasted reduces the chance of closing the deal with Bob. 

I'm choosing to accept Bob's offer and secure the sale."
