"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $11,000. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this is a fair price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is quite high. It's better to negotiate and see if we can get a lower price, closer to Alice's value of $8,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too high for me. I'm interested, but I could only do it for $9,000."",
""product_price"": 9000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $9,000 is quite a bit lower than I hoped for. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $10,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Alice is moving closer to a reasonable price, we're still aiming to get as close to $8,000 as possible. We have room to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. How about we settle at $9,500? That's a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 9500
}
``` 

We're splitting the difference in this round to show Alice we're willing to negotiate but still aiming for a good deal."
