"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. While $900,000 is a good deal, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand you're looking to get the product for a bit less. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $875,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000. What do you think?

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While he initially wanted to pay $850,000, Alice's counteroffer of $875,000 is a fair compromise. It's still a good deal for Bob, saving him $125,000 compared to buying from John.  Accepting the offer ensures he gets the product at a reasonable price without risking further negotiation."
