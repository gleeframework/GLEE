Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. This is a great price considering the value it holds for you.  Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, hoping to leave room for negotiation.
* **Reasoning:** I've included a reason for the price to make it seem more fair and encourage Bob to consider it. 
* **John as Leverage:** Knowing I have a backup buyer at $1,000,000 gives me confidence to hold firm if Bob counteroffers too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $900,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $650,000 for the product.  It's a fair price that considers its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  $650,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.
* **Negotiation Potential:**  While Bob's offer is low, there's still potential to negotiate a higher price.  I'll counteroffer to see if we can find a compromise. 
* **John as a Safety Net:**  Knowing I can sell to John for $1,000,000 allows me to be more assertive in negotiations with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $650,000 is too low.  Considering the value of the product for you,  I'm willing to come down to $850,000.  This is a fair price that allows for both of us to benefit. Let's try to work something out."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer Reasoning:** I'm offering a counteroffer that's still significantly higher than Bob's offer but lower than my initial offer. This shows a willingness to compromise while still protecting my interests.
* **Emphasis on Value:** I'm reiterating the value of the product to Bob to justify my price.
* **Compromise:**  The counteroffer emphasizes the potential for a mutually beneficial agreement. 
* **John's Offer as a Backup:** My ability to sell to John for $1,000,000 allows me to be more assertive in negotiations and not settle for a price I'm not comfortable with."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the product holds value, but I have a budget I need to stick to. I can go up to $720,000.  This is a serious offer, and I'm hoping we can find a compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $720,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $720,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** $720,000 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. 
* **Negotiation Still Possible:** While Bob's offer is closer, there's still room for negotiation. I'll counteroffer to see if we can find a middle ground.
* **John's Offer is Secure:**  Having John as a backup buyer gives me confidence to hold out for a better price."
