"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $120. It's a steal at this price, if I do say so myself!",120.0,Alice,1,

"Hey Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $120 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend.  How about $85? I'm really interested in this product, and this is the highest I can go.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $85. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we compromise at $105? It's still a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll love the product.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $105 is still a bit high for me.  I'm really serious about getting this product, and I'm willing to go up to $95.  What do you think?",95.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm not ready to give up on the price just yet. I'm willing to meet you at $102. It's a fair price considering the value this product brings. Let me know if you're willing to meet me there.",102.0,Alice,5,
