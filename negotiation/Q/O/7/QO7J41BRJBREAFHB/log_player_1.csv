"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $140. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful."", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $140, which is above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive Framing:** My message is positive and highlights the potential benefits for Bob.
* **Leaving Room:** By starting at $140, I allow myself some flexibility to come down in price if Bob counters.
* **Protecting My Value:** I'm staying above my minimum of $150, but I'm also recognizing that I need to be competitive to make a sale."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $140 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. I'm happy to pay $125 for it. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Counteroffer is Below My Minimum:**  $125 is below my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Negotiation is Still Possible:** I have room to counter with a price closer to my minimum.
* **Selling to John is a Safe Option:** While $150 is more than Bob's offer, I'm not desperate to sell to Bob at a loss.  I have John as a backup. 

**Next Steps:** I will counter Bob's offer with a price closer to my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $125 is just a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $135. It's still a great price for you, and it's a fair deal for me. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 135}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  I'm moving closer to Bob's offer, but I'm still staying above my minimum. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but also that I value the product.
* **Positive Framing:**  I'm emphasizing the ""great price"" and ""fair deal"" for Bob, hoping to encourage him to see the value in accepting. 
* **Keeping the Option Open:** By not accepting his initial counteroffer, I keep open the possibility of making a profit while still showing flexibility."
