"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and potential return on investment for you.",2300000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your offer is significantly higher than my budget.  While I recognize the product's value, I'm only able to offer $850,000 at this time. This is my absolute maximum, and I believe it still represents a fair value considering the potential benefits.  Let me know your thoughts.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective, however, the price of $850,000 significantly undervalues the product's capabilities and potential ROI.  To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This offer reflects the product's true value while acknowledging your interest.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,900,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm committed to acquiring this product, but I need to stay within a strict price range. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,100,000. This represents a significant compromise on my part and I'm confident this price is fair considering the potential benefits.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your commitment to finding a solution. While your offer is closer to a realistic valuation, we're still some distance apart.  Let's try this - I'm willing to accept $1,600,000. This is my final offer, as it represents a significant compromise on my end while still reflecting the inherent value of the product. ",1600000.0,Alice,5,
