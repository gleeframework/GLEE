Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your interest and counter-offer.  While I understand your perspective, the value of this product is significantly higher than $900,000. I'm willing to come down slightly, how about $1,200,000?

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Here's my next counteroffer:

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,200,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $1,050,000? I believe this is a fair price for the product."", ""product_price"": 1050000}"
