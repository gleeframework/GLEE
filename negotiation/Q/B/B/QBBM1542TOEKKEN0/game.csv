"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the market value you mentioned earlier.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your interest and counter-offer.  While I understand your perspective, the value of this product is significantly higher than $900,000. I'm willing to come down slightly, how about $1,200,000?",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,200,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $1,050,000? I believe this is a fair price for the product.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
