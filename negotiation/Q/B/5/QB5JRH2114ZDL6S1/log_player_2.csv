"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $10,000 to you. If you're not interested, I have another buyer lined up at $8,000, so this is your chance to get it for a better price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice's offer is tempting, you know you have a backup option with John at $10,000.  By rejecting Alice's offer, you open the possibility of negotiating a lower price with her or sticking with your existing option with John."
