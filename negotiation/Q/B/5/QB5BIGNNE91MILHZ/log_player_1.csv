Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product I think you'd be interested in. I'm asking for $150 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

This offer starts with a price higher than my minimum, leaving room for negotiation. It also expresses openness to negotiation, which might make Bob feel more comfortable making a counteroffer.  

However, I'm aware that I can always sell to John for $100, so if the negotiations stall or Bob makes a counteroffer that's too low, I'm prepared to walk away and take the guaranteed $100."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering me the product. I understand your price, but I was hoping to find something within my budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $100 is my minimum acceptable price, I'm not desperate to sell to Bob. I'll reject his offer and see if I can get a better price.  I can always sell to John for $100 if this doesn't work out."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $100 is my minimum, I'm willing to come down a bit to $125. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 125} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate your flexibility. However, I would like to keep my budget in mind. Could we possibly meet somewhere in between $125 and $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $110 is higher than my minimum and closer to my desired price than my last counteroffer. While I could try to squeeze a bit more out of him, it's likely that further negotiation would just prolong the process.  $110 is a good price, and I don't want to risk losing the sale to John."
