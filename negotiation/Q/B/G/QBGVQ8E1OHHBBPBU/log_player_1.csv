"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I think it's a fair price considering the product's worth to you is $15,000. Let me know if that's something you'd be willing to consider. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $9,000 is better than nothing, it's still far below what the product is worth to me. I'll see if I can get a better price from Bob."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $10,500? That's a good price for both of us, and it gets us closer to a deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think we can do even better. How about we aim for $10,250? That's a fair price for both of us, and it gets us closer to a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'll accept Bob's offer.  $10,250 is a decent price and it's getting closer to what I want. I don't want to risk losing him entirely by rejecting his offer."
