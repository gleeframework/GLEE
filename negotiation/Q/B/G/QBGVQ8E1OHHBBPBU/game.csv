"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. I think it's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below what it's worth to me and still a good value for you. Let me know what you think!",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I think it's a fair price considering the product's worth to you is $15,000. Let me know if that's something you'd be willing to consider.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $10,500? That's a good price for both of us, and it gets us closer to a deal. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think we can do even better. How about we aim for $10,250? That's a fair price for both of us, and it gets us closer to a deal.",10250.0,Bob,4,
