"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $15,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $8,000 for this product. What do you think?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $15,000 is a bit high for you, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer it to you for $12,000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $12,000 is still more than I can afford.  How about we split the difference and go with $10,000? ",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000, but I'm willing to meet you halfway between $12,000 and $10,000. How about we try $11,500?",11500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm really trying to make this work, but $11,500 is still pushing it for me.  Would you be willing to come down to $10,500?  That's a fair compromise, I think.",10500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close, but I'm not willing to go all the way down to $10,500. I'll meet you at $11,000, and that's my final offer. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,7,
