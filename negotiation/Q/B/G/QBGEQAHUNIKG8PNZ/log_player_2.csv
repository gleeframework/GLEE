"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product!  It's something I know will be of great value to you.  My asking price is $1,400,000.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above my budget but still within a range that might be negotiable. I'll reject her initial offer and see if we can reach a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer! I appreciate your enthusiasm. However,  $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'd be willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer but still within a range that might be acceptable to her. I've offered a price that's still above her minimum value of $1,200,000, making it a reasonable starting point for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  I understand you're trying to get the best price, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $1,300,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the product's value and allows both of us to walk away happy.  Let me know if this works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to my preferred price, but $1,350,000 is still a bit too high. I'll reject her offer and see if we can bridge the gap further. I'm still confident we can reach a mutually agreeable price within the remaining rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. I'm still a bit hesitant at $1,350,000.  How about we split the difference and settle on $1,325,000?  This feels like a fair price that allows both of us to walk away satisfied. "", ""product_price"": 1325000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering a price that's closer to my target but still leaves some room for negotiation.  I'm aiming for a compromise that allows us both to find a deal without significantly impacting our desired outcomes."
