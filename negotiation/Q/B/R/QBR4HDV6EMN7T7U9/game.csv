"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic product that I believe would be highly valuable to your business. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,000,000.  I'm confident that its value will far exceed this price.",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice, but I'm not comfortable with the initial price of $2,000,000. I'm willing to pay $1,800,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to my business.",1800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate you coming back with an offer and acknowledging the product's value.  While $2,000,000 represents a fair assessment of its worth, I'm willing to come down to $1,925,000. This offer reflects my desire to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1925000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you're willing to come down from $2,000,000, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,800,000. I think this is a fair price considering the value the product will bring to my business.",1800000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I feel we're stuck at an impasse. To be frank,  $1,800,000 significantly undervalues the product's potential. I'm willing to consider a price of $1,875,000, but this is my final offer. I believe it represents a fair compromise.",1875000.0,Alice,5,
