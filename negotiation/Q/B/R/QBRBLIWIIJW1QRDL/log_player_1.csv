I'm starting with a price of $1,500,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium.  If he rejects, I'll be ready to counteroffer, but I want to gauge his interest first."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, but it's still below what I'd like to get. I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm going to counter with $1,450,000. This is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway. I hope this will convince him to accept, but I'm still leaving room for negotiation if he's not happy with this price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,425,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,425,000

Bob's offer is getting closer to my target price, and I'm feeling confident that we're nearly at a deal. I'm going to accept his offer and secure the sale for $1,425,000. This is a good outcome, as it's above my minimum acceptable price."
