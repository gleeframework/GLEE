# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product, and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm offering it to you for $230. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $230.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice,  $230 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $80 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 80}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $80 is significantly below its value.  How about we meet in the middle at $180? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $180 is still above my budget. While it's closer to my target than her initial offer, I'm not willing to go that high yet. I will reject and counteroffer again, hoping to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $180 is still a bit out of my range though.  I'm willing to go up to $110.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I'm motivated to sell, I can't go as low as $110.  Would you consider $150? It's a fair offer, and ensures I'm not taking a loss. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $150 is still above my maximum budget of $80.  While we're getting closer, I'm not comfortable going any higher.  I'm happy to secure the product from John for $80, which is within my budget and avoids further negotiation."
