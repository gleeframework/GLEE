Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a great product for you that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm willing to offer it to you for $130.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

This offer gives you a healthy profit, but also leaves some room for negotiation if Bob is willing to pay a little more.  It also positions you to sell to John for $100 if Bob rejects the offer, guaranteeing you at least your minimum price."
