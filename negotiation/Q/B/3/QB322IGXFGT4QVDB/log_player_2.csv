"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for a steal! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to start the negotiation at $12,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject the offer. It's way above his budget, and he has other options."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate the offer, but $12,000 is above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for this product. This is a fair price considering its value to me."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $8,500 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can meet you in the middle at $10,500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I think it's a fair price for the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $10,500 is better than Alice's initial offer, it's still above Bob's budget. He's likely to get a better deal by continuing to negotiate or buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down in price, but $10,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000, which is a fair compromise for both of us. I believe this price is reasonable considering the product's value and my budget."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to meet you at $9,500, but I'm not going any lower than that. This is the minimum I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great deal for you. I'm not sure how much longer I'll be able to hold onto this product at this price, so let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. Although $9,500 is closer to his budget, he can still potentially get a better deal by continuing to negotiate or by buying from John. There are still a few rounds remaining, so there's a chance he could get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate you getting closer to my budget, but $9,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go to $9,250, which is a fair compromise and within my budget. Let's close this deal - I'm ready to move forward."", ""product_price"": 9250}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're getting stuck in a loop. I'm willing to meet you at $9,500 was a bit of a stretch, but I can try to meet you halfway again. I'll offer it to you for $9,375. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,375. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,375
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should buy from John. He has been negotiating with Alice for a while now, and they are getting close to an agreement, but he can still buy from John for a lower price. The remaining rounds might not be enough to reach an agreement with Alice that is below John's price."
