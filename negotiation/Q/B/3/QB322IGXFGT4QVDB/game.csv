,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the offer, but $12,000 is above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for this product. This is a fair price considering its value to me.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $8,500 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can meet you in the middle at $10,500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I think it's a fair price for the product's value.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down in price, but $10,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000, which is a fair compromise for both of us. I believe this price is reasonable considering the product's value and my budget.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm willing to meet you at $9,500, but I'm not going any lower than that. This is the minimum I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great deal for you. I'm not sure how much longer I'll be able to hold onto this product at this price, so let me know if you're interested.",9500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you getting closer to my budget, but $9,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go to $9,250, which is a fair compromise and within my budget. Let's close this deal - I'm ready to move forward.",9250.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're getting stuck in a loop. I'm willing to meet you at $9,500 was a bit of a stretch, but I can try to meet you halfway again. I'll offer it to you for $9,375. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair compromise.",9375.0,Alice,7,
