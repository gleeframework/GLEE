"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to part with it for a price of $900000. This is a fair and competitive offer, considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer Alice!  I really appreciate it.  However, $900000 is still a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $750000.  This is a fair price considering the product's value to me, and it gives you a good profit margin.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $750000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $825000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and my original asking price. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",825000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $825000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $800000.  This is a fair price considering the product's value to me and your original asking price.  Let's find a middle ground here.",800000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $800000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer $815000. This is the best price I can offer, considering the product's value to you and my original asking price. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",815000.0,Alice,5,
