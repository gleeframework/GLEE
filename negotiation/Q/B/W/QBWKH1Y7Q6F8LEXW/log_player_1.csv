This offer gives you a good profit while still leaving room for negotiation. It's a starting point, and you can adjust it based on Bob's reaction."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,100,000 for your product. I believe this price reflects a fair compromise between the value the product holds for me and its worth to you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,100,000 is a decent price, it's still lower than my minimum desired profit. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to get a better price in the next round."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,100,000 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000, which is a good compromise. This price allows me to achieve my minimum profit goal while still being fair to you."", ""product_price"": 1150000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. After careful consideration, I am willing to increase my offer to $1,125,000 for your product. This price aims to strike a balance between our interests and maintain a positive negotiation atmosphere. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,125,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial target price, Bob's offer of $1,125,000 is a good compromise. It's above my minimum profit, and further negotiation might lead to a stalemate. Selling to John for $1,000,000 would result in a lower profit. Therefore, I'll accept Bob's offer and sell the product."
