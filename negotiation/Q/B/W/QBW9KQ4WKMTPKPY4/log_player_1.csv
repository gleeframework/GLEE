"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1100000} 

I'm starting with a high offer, but one that still leaves room for negotiation and is significantly lower than Bob's perceived value. This should encourage him to engage in the negotiation process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, I'm still hoping for a better price.  I'm going to reject and counter-offer to see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

I'm countering with $1,050,000. This is still a good deal for Bob, as he values the product at $1,200,000. I'm hoping to find a middle ground that works for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $900,000 is tempting, it's still lower than I'd like. I'm going to reject and counter-offer again, hoping to get closer to my target. I have enough rounds left to potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,000,000. This is a reasonable compromise, as it's closer to my goal and still leaves room for a potential win-win outcome for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Even though $850,000 is close to my minimum, I still have rounds left and I'm hoping to get a slightly better price. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and counter-offer again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 975000}
```

I'm counter-offering with $975,000. This is a fair price, considering the current negotiations and leaves a bit more room for me to make a profit compared to selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

With only two rounds left, the negotiation isn't going in my favor. Bob is becoming more aggressive and I don't have enough time to potentially push him back. Selling to John for $800,000 is a safe option, as it guarantees me my minimum profit."
