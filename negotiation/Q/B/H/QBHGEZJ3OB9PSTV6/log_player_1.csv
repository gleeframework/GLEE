{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm selling to John.  While I'm close to a deal with Bob, I've now reached a point where I'm  only getting a slightly higher price from him than I can get from John. I'm not comfortable accepting a price below $80 for this product, and it's clear Bob isn't going to budge much higher. It's time to move on and ensure I get a fair price."
