"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to purchase a unique product.  Given its immense value, I believe a starting price of $1,150,000 is fair. What do you think?",1150000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $1,150,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'd be willing to pay $1,050,000. What do you think?",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  However, the value of this product is truly significant and $1,050,000 is below its worth.  Would you consider $1,120,000?  I'm confident you'll find this offer reflects the product's value.",1120000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective on the product's value, but $1,120,000 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000.  This is a serious offer, and I'm confident it reflects a fair value for both of us.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
