"Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* You are willing to pay up to $10,000 for the product. 
* Alice's offer of $9,000 is better than John's offer of $10,000.
* However, there's still room for negotiation. By rejecting Alice's offer, you can try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice is willing to sell for $8,000, so a price of $8,500 is a good starting point for negotiation. 
* This price is still within your budget of $10,000, and it gives Alice some room to negotiate. 
* By offering a lower price, you are showing Alice that you are serious about getting a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's new offer of $9,200 is slightly higher than her previous offer of $9,000. 
* However, it's still lower than the $10,000 you are willing to pay. 
* It is reasonable to continue negotiating to see if you can get a better price. 
* You can still reject the offer and try to get the price down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8800}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $9,200 is closer to your ideal price than her initial offer of $9,000.  
* This counteroffer of $8,800 is a compromise, acknowledging her willingness to come down in price but also staying within your budget. 
*  This leaves room for further negotiation if necessary, without being too far off from her desired price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $9,500 is still lower than John's price of $10,000.
* You have already made two counteroffers, and Alice has rejected them both.
* Further negotiation is likely to be unproductive, and it's more likely that Alice will not budge further.
* Accepting this offer saves you $500 compared to buying from John."
