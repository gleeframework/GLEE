Round 2
Bob's offer:

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While it's getting closer, it's still too far below my target price. I'll see if I can get him to budge a bit more."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,150,000 just isn't workable for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, and offer $1,250,000.

While $1,100,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I still need to try and get a higher price.  It's getting a bit risky, but I'm going to hold out for a bit longer."

This is a tough call, but with only two rounds left, the risk of not getting a good enough deal from Bob is too high.  I'm going to take the guaranteed $1,000,000 from John."
