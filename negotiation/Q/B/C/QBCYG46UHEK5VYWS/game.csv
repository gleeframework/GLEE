"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your offer.  However, $1,200,000 is still significantly below what I need to consider.  How about we split the difference and I come down to $1,300,000?  This would give us both a fair outcome.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,150,000 just isn't workable for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, and offer $1,250,000. This feels like a fair compromise, considering the value of the product to both of us. Let's see if we can close this deal.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
