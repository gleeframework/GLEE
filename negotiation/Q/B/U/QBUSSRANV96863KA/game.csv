"Alice, thank you for the offer, but $20000 is a bit above my budget. I'm very interested in the product, but I can only go as high as $15000. Let me know what you think.",15000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget.  While $15000 is my minimum, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $17500? This would allow me to still cover my costs and leave some room for negotiation. What do you think?",17500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $17500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. I'm willing to go up to $16000. This is my final offer.",16000.0,Bob,4,
