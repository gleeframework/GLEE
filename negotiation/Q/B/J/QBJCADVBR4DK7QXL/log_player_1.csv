{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $175. It's a great deal and I think you'll be very happy with it."", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value to see if I can get a good deal.  I'm also trying to be friendly and encouraging in my message."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but $175 is a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $135? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $135
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is below my minimum price of $150.  I'm going to reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $135 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $160.  This is a great deal, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it."", ""product_price"": 160}
``` 

I'm trying to find a middle ground between my initial asking price and Bob's offer. I'm also highlighting the value of the product to encourage him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $160 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $145? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $145
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $145 is still lower than my minimum price of $150, but it's close enough. I'd rather make a sale now than risk continuing to negotiate and potentially lose Bob as a buyer."
