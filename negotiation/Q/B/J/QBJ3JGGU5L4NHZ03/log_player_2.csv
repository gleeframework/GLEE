# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","I will reject Alice's offer. Alice's offer is $900,000, which is still $100,000 more than what I am willing to pay ($1,000,000 - $900,000 = $100,000). I will reject the offer and buy the product from John for $1,000,000.
