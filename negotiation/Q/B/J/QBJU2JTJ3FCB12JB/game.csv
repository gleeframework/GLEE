"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a unique asset that will bring significant value to your business. I'm willing to offer it to you for $15,000. What are your thoughts?",15000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for offering the product, Alice. I appreciate your generosity. However, my budget allows me to spend up to $8,000 on this purchase. Would it be possible for us to negotiate a price closer to that amount?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $8,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a price of $12,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. However, I'm also open to negotiating further if you're willing to meet me in the middle. What are your thoughts?",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. Considering my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price of $9,000 for the product. This would allow me to stay within my financial limits while still acquiring a valuable asset. I hope we can come to an agreement.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but $9,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I can offer you a price of $13,500, which is a significant discount from my original offer. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",13500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Thank you for considering my previous offers, Alice. I understand that we have a difference in our valuation of the product. Given my budget constraints, I am proposing a final offer of $10,000 for the product. I hope this proposal will be acceptable and we can move forward with the transaction.",10000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but $10,000 is still not enough for me to meet my minimum price. I'm starting to think that we're getting close to the end of our negotiation. I can offer you a price of $14,000, which is my best and final offer. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",14000.0,Alice,7,

"I appreciate your efforts to find a middle ground, Alice. After careful consideration, I would like to propose a final offer of $11,000 for the product. I hope this proposal will be within your acceptable range, allowing us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",11000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think that we're not going to meet in the middle, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I can offer you a price of $13,500, which is my absolute best and final offer. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options. This is my last offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",13500.0,Alice,9,
