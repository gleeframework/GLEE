Round 2
Bob's offer:

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to $1.35 million to make this work.  How about $1,360,000?  This is my best offer."",

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, but I still think $1,360,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you at $1,320,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.

Bob has signaled this is his final offer. While we could push for more, we risk him walking away. Accepting $1,320,000 is a strong return, and better than John's guaranteed $1,000,000."
