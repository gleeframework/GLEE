"Alice, $1,300,000 is way above my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I can only go up to $850,000. Let's see if we can find a common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate you taking the time to consider this offer. While $1,300,000 reflects the true value of this product, I understand your budget constraints.  How about we meet halfway at $1,100,000? This is a significant reduction and reflects my willingness to make a deal.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $1,100,000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm prepared to offer $900,000.  Let's try to bridge the gap.",900000.0,Bob,4,
