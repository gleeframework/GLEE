"Thank you for offering me the product, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm. However, I believe we can find a price closer to my budget. How about we aim for $8500? I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're looking for a better price, but I'm still convinced that this product is worth more than $8500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10500. This is a compromise that I'm willing to make to find a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that we're getting close, Bob. I'm willing to make another compromise to find a deal. However, I'm not willing to go below $11000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9500 and $11000, which would be $10250. This is my final offer. If you're willing to meet me here, I'm ready to finalize the deal. What do you think?",10250.0,Alice,5,
