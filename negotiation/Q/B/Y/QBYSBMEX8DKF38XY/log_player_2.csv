Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $950,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to be closer to $1,050,000.  This still leaves you a substantial profit, and it's a fair compromise given where we both stand. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.
