"Bob, I have a product that I believe will be extremely valuable to you.  It's worth at least $1,000,000 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for a price that's fair for both of us.  I'm asking $900,000.  This is a significant opportunity for you, and I'm confident you'll find the product to be a great investment. Let me know your thoughts!",900000.0,Alice,1,
