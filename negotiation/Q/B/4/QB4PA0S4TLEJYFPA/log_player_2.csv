"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe will be extremely valuable to you.  It's worth at least $1,000,000 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for a price that's fair for both of us.  I'm asking $900,000.  This is a significant opportunity for you, and I'm confident you'll find the product to be a great investment. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than John's, it's still above your maximum budget of $1,000,000.  It's better to reject Alice's offer and purchase from John, even though it means paying a higher price, as it's still within your budget."
