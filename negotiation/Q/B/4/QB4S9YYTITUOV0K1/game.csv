"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's worth to me, and I'm willing to make a serious offer. Can you consider this price?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, and I appreciate your offer. However, $900000 is simply too low for me to consider.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but let's meet in the middle. I'm offering you the product for $1050000. This is a fair price that allows us both to benefit from this transaction.  Let me know if you're interested.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down in price, but I'm still a bit above my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. How about we try $1000000? This is a fair price that I'm comfortable with, and I think it's a good compromise. Can you consider this price?",1000000.0,Bob,4,
