"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm very interested in the product, but $1,400,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $1,050,000?",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $1,050,000 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product, and it allows us both to come to an agreement. What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $1,300,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit high. Would you consider $1,150,000?",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good price, but $1,150,000 is still significantly lower than what the product is worth. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,250,000. This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away feeling satisfied.  Let me know if you're interested in finalizing the deal.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
