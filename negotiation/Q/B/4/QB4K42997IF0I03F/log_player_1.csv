"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential, I believe a starting price of $2,200,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 2200000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High (but not outrageous):**  I'm beginning significantly higher than both Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000) and my minimum ($1,500,000). This allows room for negotiation and creates the perception of the product's high value.
* **Gauge Bob's Interest:** This first offer is designed to see how Bob reacts.  His response will tell me a lot about how badly he wants the product and his negotiation style.
* **Alternative Option:**  I have John as a backup plan, so I'm not desperate for a deal. This allows me to be more confident and less likely to settle for a low price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering me the product. I understand its value, but I would like to propose a lower price. How about $1,800,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above My Minimum:** Bob's offer of $1,800,000 is above my minimum acceptable price. However, it's still significantly lower than my initial ask, and there's room for negotiation. 
* **Early Stages:**  It's only Round 2. Rejecting this offer signals that I'm serious about getting a higher price and won't immediately cave.
* **Testing the Waters:** By rejecting, I can gauge how flexible Bob is willing to be. His next offer will reveal more about how badly he wants the product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but the product's value significantly exceeds that figure. I'm willing to come down slightly to $2,000,000. This price reflects the true worth of what's being offered."", 
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** I'm showing willingness to negotiate by decreasing my price, but it's a relatively small concession ($200,000). 
* **Holding Firm:** I'm still well above both Bob's offer and my minimum. This emphasizes the product's value and my strong position.
* **Encouraging a Serious Response:** This counteroffer aims to push Bob closer to my desired range. His next move will reveal if he's a serious buyer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your response, Alice. Considering the market value and my budget, I would like to propose a price of $1,900,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Approaching the Target:** Bob is getting closer to my desired price range. His offer is now only $100,000 away from my minimum acceptable price.
* **Maintaining Pressure:**  I want to maintain negotiating pressure and see if I can extract a bit more value. Accepting at this point might leave money on the table.
* **Calculated Risk:** I'm willing to risk John's offer for another round or two to see if Bob will meet or exceed my $1,900,000 target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence and understand your position. Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to accept $1,950,000 for the product. This offer represents a significant compromise on my end and reflects my desire to close this deal."", 
""product_price"": 1950000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:**  This counteroffer meets Bob halfway between his last offer ($1,900,000) and my previous ask ($2,000,000). It demonstrates fairness and a desire to reach an agreement.
* **Above Minimum, Emphasizing Compromise:**  I'm still above my absolute minimum while highlighting that I'm making a significant concession to seal the deal.
* **Urgency and Finality:** The tone suggests this is my final offer, creating a sense of urgency for Bob to accept.  It's a strong position to assess his true willingness to pay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. Based on my budget and the current market conditions, I would like to propose a final offer of $1,925,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Profit:** Bob's final offer of $1,925,000 is significantly above my minimum price of $1,500,000. Accepting ensures a substantial profit.
* **Diminishing Returns:**  Continuing to negotiate might only yield small incremental gains, with the risk of Bob backing out entirely. 
* **""Final Offer"" Signal:** Bob has indicated this is his final offer, making it unlikely he'll go higher. 
* **Time Value of Money:** Closing the deal now avoids potential delays and allows me to reinvest the proceeds sooner."
