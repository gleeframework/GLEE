Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product, which I know you see great value in.  Given its potential, I'm suggesting a price of $925,000. I think this is a fair price that reflects the significant benefit it will bring to your operations."", 
""product_price"": 925000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Valuation:** You're aware that the product is worth $1,000,000 to Bob. This gives you significant leverage in negotiations.
* **Maximizing Profit:** While you have a safety net with John at $800,000, aiming for a price closer to Bob's valuation maximizes your potential profit. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $925,000 leaves some space for potential negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, but you're still in a strong position to secure a final price well above your minimum.
* **Justification:**  The message subtly implies you have a good understanding of the product's value to Bob, making the offer seem more reasonable and less arbitrary."
