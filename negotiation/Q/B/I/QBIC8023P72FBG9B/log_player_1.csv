"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json

```

This is a starting point. I'm aiming high, as I know the product is worth at least $1,000,000 to me. I'm hoping to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to pay a premium. I'll be ready to adjust the price based on his response and how many rounds we have left."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,200,000 is a decent offer, I'm confident I can get a better price. I'm not desperate to sell, and have John as a backup option.  I'll counter Bob's offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000}
```

I'm going to meet Bob halfway, but still hold firm to my belief that the product is worth more. I'm reducing my price, but not by much, to show good faith and encourage him to continue negotiating. I'll see if he's willing to budge closer to my price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob is getting closer, but I'm still hoping for a better price. I'm confident that I can get closer to my asking price, especially since I have John as a backup. I'll counteroffer again in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000} 
```

I'm lowering my price again, but only slightly.  I want to show Bob that I'm serious about making a deal, but I'm not willing to give up too much.  We're getting closer, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement."
