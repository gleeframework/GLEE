"I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $9,000 is too low, I'm willing to come down to $12,500. This is my bottom line, as the product's value truly justifies this price.",12500.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you think the product is valuable, but I'm still not convinced it's worth $12,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $11,250. Can you consider that?",11250.0,Bob,4,
