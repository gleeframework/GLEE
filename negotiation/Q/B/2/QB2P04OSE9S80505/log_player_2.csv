"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a fantastic deal, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You can do better than $1,400,000.  Alice's product is worth $1,200,000 to her, so there's room for negotiation.  By rejecting, you can try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $1,300,000.  This would still be a great deal for you, considering your value for the product.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1300000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,300,000 is just a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000.  It's still a great deal for you, and we can finalize the sale quickly. Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $1,350,000. This is a good price for you, as it's lower than John's price of $1,500,000.  There's a chance you could get a slightly lower price, but it's not worth risking losing the deal and having to buy from John."
