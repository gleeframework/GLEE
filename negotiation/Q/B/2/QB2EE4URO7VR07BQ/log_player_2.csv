While Alice's offer is getting closer to your target, it's still above your ideal price. It's worth trying one more counteroffer to see if you can reach a deal. If she rejects, you can always buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

```

Alice is clearly not willing to budge on her price.  At this point, it's better to just buy from John and avoid further negotiation. You've already gotten a good price from John, and continuing to negotiate with Alice could drag things out and potentially lead to a worse outcome."
