"I'm excited to offer you the product at a special price of $15,000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a deal like this anywhere else. What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate the offer, Alice, but $15,000 is a bit outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product, which is fair considering its value to you.  Let's see if we can make this happen.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to stay within your budget, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $12,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $14,000. This is a compromise I'm willing to make to find a mutually beneficial deal.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $14,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm really hoping to stay at $12,000, which is a fair price for both of us.  Let's see if we can find a way to make this work.",12000.0,Bob,4,
