"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you the product at a special price of $15,000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a deal like this anywhere else. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $15,000 is above his budget, and he can get the same product from John for less.  It makes sense to try and negotiate with Alice to get a better price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to stay within your budget, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $12,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $14,000. This is a compromise I'm willing to make to find a mutually beneficial deal.

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $14,000 is closer to his budget, he can still get the product from John for $12,000.  It's worth trying to negotiate further with Alice to see if she'll come down to his target price."
