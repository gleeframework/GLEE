"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $800,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",800000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I recognize the product's unique qualities, $800,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $600,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",600000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $800,000 might be a stretch for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $750,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to go, considering the product's true value to you.",750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $750,000 is still a bit high for me.  Let's split the difference. I'm offering $700,000. This is my final offer, as I'm ready to move on to other options if we can't find an agreement.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're trying to split the difference, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $700,000. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll sell the product to you for $725,000. This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower.",725000.0,Alice,5,
