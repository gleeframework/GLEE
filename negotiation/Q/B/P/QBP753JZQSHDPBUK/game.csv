"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but that price is a little too high for me. Would you consider $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1,000,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a discount, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for the product. My revised offer is $1,100,000.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  How about we settle at $1,050,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're close to a deal, Bob. However, $1,050,000 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you in the middle again, but I need to get closer to my target. My revised offer is $1,080,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1080000.0,Alice,5,
