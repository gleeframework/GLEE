"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* You're willing to pay up to $150, and Alice is offering $140.  
* This is a good starting point, but you can likely negotiate a lower price. 
* By rejecting, you start the counter-offering process and potentially save money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
```

**Reasoning:**

* I'm offering $130, which is $10 less than Alice's initial offer. This is a reasonable starting point for a counteroffer, as it shows I'm serious about buying but am also trying to get a better price. 
* I have 9 rounds left, so I have time to negotiate further if necessary."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $142. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $142
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer increased from $140 to $142. While still within my budget, it's moving in the wrong direction. 
* I'm going to reject this offer and try to get her back down to my initial counteroffer of $130.
* With 8 rounds left, I still have time to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 135}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice increased her price, so I'm going to increase my counteroffer slightly to $135. This shows I'm willing to compromise, but I'm still trying to get a better deal. 
* I'm hoping this will be more appealing to Alice than my previous offer of $130, and we can start to close the gap.
* I still have 7 rounds left to negotiate, so there's room to adjust if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $145
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice keeps increasing her price, making it less attractive to me.  While I'm still within my budget, I don't want to settle for a price higher than my initial counteroffer of $135.
* With 6 rounds remaining, I still have time to try and negotiate a better price.
* I'll reject this offer and attempt to counteroffer again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 138}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer is getting closer to my budget, but I'm still trying to negotiate a lower price.
* By offering $138, I'm showing I'm willing to meet her halfway, but I'm still not willing to go above my initial counteroffer of $135.
* I have 5 rounds remaining, so I still have time to negotiate further if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $148. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $148
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer is now $148, which is getting very close to my maximum budget of $150. 
* With only 4 rounds remaining, the risk of failing to reach an agreement with Alice is becoming too high. 
* It's more advantageous to buy from John at $150 to guarantee I get the product and avoid further negotiation with Alice."
