"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe would be incredibly valuable to you. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000.  I'm open to discussing this further, so please let me know your thoughts.",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your response, Bob. I understand your perspective, but $900,000 is below its true value.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,025,000? This recognizes its worth while still offering you significant value.",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my target budget. Would you be willing to consider $950,000? I believe this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find a compromise.  While $950,000 is tempting, I'm still aiming for a price closer to $1,000,000 to reflect the true value of this product.  Would you be willing to consider $980,000? I believe this is my final offer.",980000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, Alice, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $950,000 and $980,000. Would you consider $970,000? This is my final offer.",970000.0,Bob,6,
