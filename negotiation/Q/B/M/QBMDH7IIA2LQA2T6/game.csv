"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you! I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As such, I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000.",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, $12,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it.  What do you think?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 might be a stretch for you, but I'm still very interested in selling this product to you. Given your offer of $8,500, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell it to you for $10,000.",10000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,000 is still more than I'm comfortable spending.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $8,500.  It's a fair price considering the product's value to me and your potential profit.",8500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're sticking to your original offer, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $8,500. I'm willing to make another concession and offer it to you for $9,500. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",9500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate.  While $9,500 is closer to my budget, I'm still hoping we can reach an agreement on my original offer of $8,500. This price allows both of us to get a good deal. I'm confident that we can find a solution that works for both of us.",8500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're still holding out for $8,500, Bob, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $9,000. This is my final offer, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",9000.0,Alice,7,
