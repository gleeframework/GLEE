Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're close to your target price, Bob! I'm willing to make another concession. I can offer the product to you for $132.50. It's the lowest I can go without losing too much profit. What do you think?

**Reasoning:**

Alice is now only $2.50 above my ideal price.  I'm close to my target, and it's likely she won't go any lower. Accepting this offer is a good move, as I'll still save a bit of money compared to buying from John."
