Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $20,000. I know this is a significant purchase, but I truly believe it's worth the value it will bring you. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 20000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always better to start negotiations with a higher price than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a price closer to Bob's maximum perceived value.
* **Justification:** Offering a reason for the price, even if it's simply highlighting the value, can make Bob more receptive.
* **Leaving the Door Open:** By asking ""What do you think?"", we invite Bob to counter-offer and engage in a dialogue, increasing the chance of a sale.

**Important Considerations:**

*  **Bob's Perspective:** While we know Bob values the product at $15,000, he doesn't know our minimum. A successful negotiation depends on finding a price point acceptable to both parties. 
* **Alternative Buyer:**  We have a safety net with John, ensuring we won't go below our minimum price. This gives us some leverage in the negotiation with Bob."
