"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you're looking for a good deal.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer, but $9,000 is simply too low. How about we meet in the middle at $10,500? This would still leave me with a profit and allow you to get a valuable product at a reasonable price.  What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit shy of $10,500. How about we meet at $9,500? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",9500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. I'm coming down a bit more, but $9,500 is still too low for me.  How about $10,000?  That's a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit.  Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate.  I'm willing to make one final concession, but $9,800 is still too low for me.  How about we settle at $10,200?  This is a fair price that allows me to make a reasonable profit and gives you a great deal on a valuable product.  What do you say?",10200.0,Alice,7,
