"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000.  It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it valuable.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting with a price of $12,000. This is significantly higher than what the product is worth to Bob, but it leaves room for negotiation. It also positions me well in case I need to counteroffer. 
* **Message:** I'm keeping the message friendly and focusing on the value of the product for Bob. This helps create a positive atmosphere for negotiation.

**Strategy:**

I'm aiming to maximize my profit, but I'm also considering the risk of losing Bob as a buyer.  By starting high, I create a buffer for potential counteroffers and leave space for a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $9,000 is better than nothing, it's still far below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob, hoping to reach a more favorable agreement. 

**Strategy:**

I'm confident that I can secure a better price than $9,000. By rejecting Bob's offer and continuing the negotiation, I can explore other possibilities and try to close the gap between our desired prices."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you're looking for a good deal.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer, but $9,000 is simply too low. How about we meet in the middle at $10,500? This would still leave me with a profit and allow you to get a valuable product at a reasonable price.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:**  I'm offering $10,500, which is halfway between my initial offer ($12,000) and Bob's offer ($9,000). This demonstrates flexibility and shows willingness to compromise. 
* **Message:** I'm emphasizing the value of the product and the fairness of the offer.  I'm also appealing to Bob's desire for a good deal.

**Strategy:**

By making a counteroffer closer to Bob's offer, I'm increasing the likelihood of him accepting. This approach builds momentum towards a deal while still ensuring I get a reasonable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit shy of $10,500. How about we meet at $9,500? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $9,500 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still not ideal. I'm willing to continue negotiating to see if I can secure a higher price. 

**Strategy:**

I'm confident I can get a better deal than $9,500. By rejecting Bob's offer and continuing the negotiation, I can explore other possibilities and try to close the gap between our desired prices. I'm aware of the time limit (10 rounds) and the option to sell to John, but I'm not willing to settle for a price that's significantly lower than my minimum target yet."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. I'm coming down a bit more, but $9,500 is still too low for me.  How about $10,000?  That's a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm offering $10,000, which is a compromise between my previous offer ($10,500) and Bob's offer ($9,500). This shows that I'm willing to negotiate and find a solution that works for both of us. 
* **Message:** I'm reiterating my willingness to work with Bob and emphasizing that my offer is fair and allows me to make a reasonable profit. I'm hoping this will encourage him to accept.

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer is a calculated move. I'm trying to close the gap between our desired prices while still staying above my minimum acceptable price. I'm also trying to maintain a positive and collaborative tone, hoping to encourage Bob to accept my offer.  If he rejects, I'll have to consider selling to John in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to work with me, but I'm still a bit shy of $10,000. How about we meet at $9,800? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $9,800 is tempting, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob, hoping to reach a more favorable agreement. 

**Strategy:**

I'm confident that I can secure a better price than $9,800. By rejecting Bob's offer and continuing the negotiation, I can explore other possibilities and try to close the gap between our desired prices.  I'm aware of the time limit (10 rounds) and the option to sell to John, but I'm not willing to settle for a price that's significantly lower than my minimum target yet."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate.  I'm willing to make one final concession, but $9,800 is still too low for me.  How about we settle at $10,200?  This is a fair price that allows me to make a reasonable profit and gives you a great deal on a valuable product.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10200}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm offering $10,200, which is halfway between my previous offer ($10,000) and Bob's offer ($9,800). This demonstrates a final attempt to meet in the middle and find a mutually agreeable price.
* **Message:** I'm reiterating my willingness to negotiate and emphasizing the fairness of the offer. I'm also reminding Bob that we're nearing the end of the negotiation and this is my final offer.

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer is a calculated risk.  I'm hoping to close the deal by offering a price that's only slightly above Bob's offer. However, if he rejects, I'll have to consider selling to John in the next round. This is my last opportunity to secure a price closer to my target before I'm forced to choose John as the buyer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your final concession, but I'm still a bit shy of $10,200. How about we meet at $9,900? I think that's a fair price for both of us, and I'm willing to make a decision at this point. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,900
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $9,900 is a decent offer, it's still considerably lower than my target price of $15,000.  We're running out of time, and I'm not willing to risk losing a significant amount of money. John is a reliable buyer who's willing to pay my minimum acceptable price.

**Strategy:**

I've reached a point where the potential gains from further negotiation are outweighed by the risk of not closing a deal.  Selling to John ensures I get my desired price and minimizes any potential losses.  It's a strategic move to protect my financial interests and secure a favorable outcome."
