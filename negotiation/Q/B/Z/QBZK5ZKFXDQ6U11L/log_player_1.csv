Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000. This is a unique opportunity to acquire an asset of this caliber."", 
""product_price"": 1200000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since we know Bob values the product at $800,000 and we have a guaranteed sale at that price, we can afford to start high. This leaves room for negotiation while ensuring we don't settle for less than our minimum. 
* **Justification:**  The message emphasizes the product's ""value and potential"" to justify the high price. 
* **Exclusivity:** Highlighting that this is an ""exclusive opportunity"" aims to make the offer more enticing.

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer.  We can always negotiate down if Bob rejects it. The goal is to maximize profit, and this strategy gives us the best chance to do so."
