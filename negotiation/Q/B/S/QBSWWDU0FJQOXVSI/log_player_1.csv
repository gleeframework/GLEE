Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $1,500,000 to match what John offers.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is only worth $1,000,000 to Bob.
* **Your Leverage:** You have a guaranteed buyer (John) at your desired price.

**The Strategy**

Since you have a guaranteed sale at $1,500,000, there's no incentive to go lower for Bob.  You can aim high, knowing you have a safety net.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,450,000. I believe this represents a fair offer considering the significant benefits it provides."",
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **High Starting Point:** We start just slightly below your absolute minimum to give the impression of negotiation room. 
* **Confident Language:** The message emphasizes the product's ""unique value"" to justify the high price.
* **No Urgency:** You don't want to pressure Bob. Let him consider and potentially counter-offer.

**Possible Outcomes**

* **Bob Accepts:**  You get a great deal, exceeding your minimum.
* **Bob Negotiates:**  He might try to haggle. Be prepared to stand firm or make very small concessions. 
* **Bob Rejects:** No problem! You sell to John at your desired price. 

**Important:** This is just one approach. You can adjust the price and message based on your assessment of Bob's negotiating style and risk tolerance."
