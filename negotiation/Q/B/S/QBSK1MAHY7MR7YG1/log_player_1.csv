Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $149. I think you'll find it's a great deal."", ""product_price"": 149}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $150, you want to see if you can get more from Bob. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  While you don't want to go below $150, starting with $149 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially counter-offer if he's really interested.  
* **Appear Reasonable:** Offering a price slightly below your guaranteed sale price makes it seem like Bob is getting a good deal, increasing the chance he'll accept."
