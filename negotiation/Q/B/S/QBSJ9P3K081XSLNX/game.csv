"Alice, thank you for the offer, but $18,000 is far beyond what I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to offer $10,000 for the product, considering it's worth $10,000 to me. This would be a fair deal for both of us.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $10,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you a price of $16,000, which is a 33% discount from my initial offer. I believe this is a fair price considering the value the product will bring to you.",16000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my offer, but $16,000 is still too high.  I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product.  This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident I can make good use of the product.",12000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a fair price, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I still need to make a profit on this deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I can offer you a price of $14,000, which is a 22% discount from my initial offer. I believe this is a reasonable compromise.",14000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm getting closer to your price but $14,000 is still pushing my limits.  How about we settle on $13,000?  This is a fair compromise that lets you make a profit and allows me to stay within my budget.  Let's make this deal happen.",13000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm willing to make one more concession. However, $13,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you at $14,500, which is just $500 above your latest offer. This is my final compromise, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value the product will bring to you.",14500.0,Alice,7,
