Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but $850,000 significantly undervalues the product's potential. I could consider coming down to $1,000,000. This offer reflects the true worth of what I'm offering.

```

**Explanation:**

While $1,000,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his maximum.  Bob wants to save as much money as possible, so rejecting the offer allows him to continue negotiating with Alice and potentially get an even lower price."
