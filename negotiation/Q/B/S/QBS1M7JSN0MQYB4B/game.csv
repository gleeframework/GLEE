"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I really appreciate it. However, $180 is a bit out of my budget.  Would you consider $120? That's the highest I can go right now.",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're on a budget, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $120. I can meet you halfway, though. How about $155? It's a great deal, and I think you'll really like the product.",155.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $155 is still a bit high for me. I'm happy to meet you at $140. Let me know what you think.",140.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're still a bit hesitant, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession. How about we meet at $145? I think it's a fair price for this amazing product.",145.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  However, $145 is still more than I'm comfortable spending.  If you're willing to come down to $135, we have a deal.  Let me know what you think.",135.0,Bob,6,

"I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob! I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $142? It's a bit higher than your last offer, but I think it's a fair price for this high-quality product.",142.0,Alice,7,
