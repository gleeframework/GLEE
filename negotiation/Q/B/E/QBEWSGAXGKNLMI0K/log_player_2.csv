Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and am willing to consider your offer. To find common ground, I would like to counter with a price of $900000 for the product. This offer aims to provide a fair compromise between our interests.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming for a lower price. While $900,000 is better than Alice's initial offer, it's still above Bob's target price.  Rejecting allows Bob to continue negotiating and potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $900,000 is still a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to offer $875,000 for the product. This price reflects a reasonable compromise while ensuring a fair transaction for both of us."", ""product_price"": 875000}

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your continued engagement, Bob. I appreciate your efforts to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. In light of your latest offer, I would like to counter with a price of $890000 for the product. This figure aims to closely align with your budget while still reflecting the value we place on it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $890,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $890,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $890,000 is getting closer to Bob's target price and is a reasonable compromise. Continuing to negotiate may result in a lower price, but there's a risk that Alice will become less willing to negotiate or even reject future offers. Accepting this offer saves Bob $110,000 compared to buying from John and ensures a deal within the remaining rounds."
