{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a point that is favorable to me (Alice), while still leaving room for potential compromise. It is close to my minimum acceptable price, but still leaves some room for Bob to bargain without feeling like he's being taken advantage of. This should encourage him to engage in a productive negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price, and I'm confident I can get a better price. I'm going to reject his offer and counteroffer with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit further.  How about $1,050,000?  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product to you."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not convinced that $1,050,000 is a good price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to be careful with my budget. How about $950,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, $950,000 is still too low.  I'm willing to continue negotiating, but I need to be firm and ensure I get a price that reflects the value of the product.  I'll counteroffer with a price that is closer to my desired amount."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I understand you're working with a budget, but $950,000 just doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to compromise further. How about $1,000,000? This is a fair price that reflects the product's value to you, and it's the lowest I can go."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,000,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to make one more serious offer. How about $975,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While I'm close to my minimum acceptable price with Bob's offer of $975,000,  I'm still a bit short of what I'd like to earn.  Since John is willing to pay my full asking price, it's best to avoid further negotiations with Bob and close the deal with John."
