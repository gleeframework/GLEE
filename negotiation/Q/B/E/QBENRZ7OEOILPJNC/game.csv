"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit further.  How about $1,050,000?  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product to you.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob,  I understand you're working with a budget, but $950,000 just doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to compromise further. How about $1,000,000? This is a fair price that reflects the product's value to you, and it's the lowest I can go.",1000000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,000,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to make one more serious offer. How about $975,000?",975000.0,Bob,6,
