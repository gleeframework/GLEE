Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its incredible value and potential, I'm confident it's worth a significant investment. I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000. This is a unique opportunity to acquire something truly exceptional."",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Stakes:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,000,000, you have room to negotiate higher with Bob.
* **Anchoring:** Starting with a high offer of $1,500,000 sets an ambitious anchor point. Even if Bob negotiates down, you're likely to end up with a price significantly higher than your minimum.
* **Value Emphasis:** The message focuses on the product's ""value"" and ""potential"" rather than just its features. This justifies the high asking price. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Perspective:** While the product is worth $1,000,000 to Bob, his willingness to pay more depends on factors like his financial situation and perceived value. 
* **Negotiation:** Be prepared for Bob to counter-offer. Have a strategy in mind for how low you're willing to go."
