"I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob. However, I have to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $110. Is that something you'd be interested in?",110.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me. $100 is still above my budget, though. I'm willing to pay $95 for this product. This is my final offer, as I'm ready to buy from John if we can't reach an agreement.",95.0,Bob,6,

"I understand you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go below $105. I can see you're willing to pay $95, but that's not enough for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $95 and $105, which is $100. I'll make one last offer: I'll sell the product to you for $100. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider selling it to John for $120.",100.0,Alice,7,
