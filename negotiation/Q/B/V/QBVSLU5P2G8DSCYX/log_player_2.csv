"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a great product for you that I'm sure you'll love. I'm offering it to you for $150. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's always worth trying to negotiate.  Even if Alice's value for the product is close to $150, there's a chance she might be willing to go lower to make a sale."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $150 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  Would you consider $120?"", ""product_price"": 120}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $120 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $135. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $135 is a good price, it's still above my target. There's room for further negotiation, and I'm willing to risk one more round to see if I can get closer to my goal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you being flexible. $135 is closer, but I'm still hoping to get it for $130.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway there?"", ""product_price"": 130}
```"
