"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to own this incredible product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing an initial offer of $1,300,000. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement."", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm beginning with a price significantly higher than both my minimum ($1,000,000) and Bob's perceived value ($800,000). This creates room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest and flexibility. 
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes the product's ""value and potential,"" subtly justifying the high price without revealing my hand. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone remains positive and collaborative, expressing confidence in reaching a deal and encouraging Bob to engage in the negotiation process.

This strategy allows me to gather information about Bob's willingness to pay while keeping the option of accepting John's offer of $1,000,000 on the table."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I'm looking to save some money. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. I think it's a fair price considering its value and potential. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $900,000 is closer to his perceived value, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. I'm not willing to sell at a loss. I believe there's room for negotiation, and I'll aim to steer the price closer to my target in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you countering and recognizing the inherent value of this product.  While your offer is thoughtful,  I'm targeting a price closer to $1,200,000. This reflects the true worth and potential this product holds. Are you open to finding a middle ground?"", 
""product_price"": 1200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledging Bob:**  Start by acknowledging Bob's counteroffer and thanking him for recognizing the product's value. This maintains a positive and collaborative atmosphere.
* **Holding Firm (For Now):** I'm reducing my price but still aiming significantly above both Bob's offer and my minimum. This demonstrates firmness while leaving room for further negotiation.
* **Seeking Middle Ground:**  The message explicitly expresses a desire to find a ""middle ground,"" encouraging Bob to make a counter-proposal and move closer to my target price.
* **Strategic Timing:** I'm conscious of the remaining rounds and the guaranteed $1,000,000 from John. My counter-offers will become more flexible as we approach the later rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but I'm still looking to save some money. I'm willing to meet you halfway and pay $1,100,000 for the product. I think it's a fair compromise considering the value and potential of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is now above my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. While I could try to push for a slightly higher price in subsequent rounds, there's a risk that Bob might lower his offer or walk away altogether. Accepting this offer guarantees a significant profit and avoids the uncertainty of continued negotiation."
