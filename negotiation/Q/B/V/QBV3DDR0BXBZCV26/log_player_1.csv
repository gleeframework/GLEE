"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of the product might be high to someone, but my budget is limited. I am willing to pay up to $15000 for the product. Could we meet in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $15,000 is my minimum, I believe the product has more value.  I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $15,000 is simply too low for me.  I understand your budget is tight, but this product is truly exceptional.  I'm willing to come down to $17,500. This is a significant concession from my original price.  I believe this is a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 17500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your price. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Given my budget constraints, I would like to propose $16000 as a compromise. I hope this meets somewhere in the middle for us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $16,000 is only $1,000 less than my counteroffer. This is a reasonable compromise, and it's a much better deal than selling to John for $15,000.  I'm willing to close the deal."
