"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of the product might be high to someone, but my budget is limited. I am willing to pay up to $15000 for the product. Could we meet in the middle?",15000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $15000 is simply too low for me.  I understand your budget is tight, but this product is truly exceptional.  I'm willing to come down to $17500. This is a significant concession from my original price.  I believe this is a fair price for both of us.",17500.0,Alice,3,
