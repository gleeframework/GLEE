Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $19,000. I believe it presents significant value, even exceeding the $10,000 worth you see in it. This is a limited-time offer, so please let me know your decision soon."",
""product_price"": 19000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, your goal is to see if you can get more from Bob.
* **High Initial Offer:** Starting with a price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($10,000) allows room for negotiation. The $19,000 offer aims to test his willingness to pay a premium.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  By mentioning a ""limited-time offer,"" you encourage Bob to make a decision quickly, potentially preventing him from overthinking or trying to lowball you.
* **Justification of Value:** While the message acknowledges Bob's perceived value, it emphasizes the product's potential to be worth even more. This subtle persuasion aims to shift his perception towards a higher value.

**Important:** If Bob rejects this initial offer, you can always negotiate down towards a price closer to $15,000. However, starting high gives you the best chance to maximize your potential profit."
