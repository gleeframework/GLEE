Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 2000000} 

I'm starting high, at $2,000,000, to gauge Bob's interest. This leaves room for negotiation if needed, and also demonstrates the value I place on my product. If he rejects, I can then use the information to adjust my next offer strategically."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is the minimum I'm willing to accept.  However, I can potentially do better. By rejecting his offer, I can make a counteroffer and see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $1,750,000.  This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer. I'm hoping to find a middle ground that's acceptable to both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,600,000 is a good compromise.  While I'd prefer a bit more, it's above my minimum acceptable price and a significant improvement over John's offer. I'm accepting to secure the sale and avoid further negotiation."
