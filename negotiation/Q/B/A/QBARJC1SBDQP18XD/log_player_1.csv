Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $900,000 is still a bit higher than my budget allows.  I'm prepared to offer $850,000 for the product.  This represents a significant savings for you, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
