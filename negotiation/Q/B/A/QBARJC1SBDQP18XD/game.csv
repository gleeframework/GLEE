"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $900,000 is still a bit higher than my budget allows.  I'm prepared to offer $850,000 for the product.  This represents a significant savings for you, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product to me.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking that $850,000 is still a bit below the value I was expecting. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $875,000. This is a compromise that I believe is fair considering the value of the product to you.",875000.0,Alice,3,
