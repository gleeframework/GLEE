Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

I'll reject Bob's offer.  $11,000 is below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. I'll try to get a better price from Bob in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest but $11,000 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $13,000, which is still a great deal for you considering the value of the product. Let's find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 13000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $13000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $12500. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

I'll accept Bob's offer. $12,500 is above my minimum acceptable price of $12,000 and it's a good compromise."
