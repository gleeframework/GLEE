"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it has the potential to greatly benefit your business and personal life. I'm willing to offer it to you for $750,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's value to you.",750000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. This product is interesting to me, but $750,000 is a bit too high for my budget.  Would you be willing to come down to $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $750,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $600,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $700,000. This is still a great deal considering the product's value to you.",700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  However, $700,000 is still a bit of a stretch. Would you consider $650,000? That would be a fair compromise.",650000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $700,000 is still a bit high for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $650,000. I'm willing to compromise further and offer the product to you for $675,000. This is the lowest I can go, but I believe it's still a great deal considering the product's value to you.",675000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, this is getting closer to what I can afford.  How about we settle at $660,000? I'm hoping we can finalize this soon.",660000.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $665,000, but that's as low as I can go. This is already a significant discount from my original offer, and I'm confident that you'll find the product's value justifies the price. Let's finalize the deal at $665,000.",665000.0,Alice,7,
