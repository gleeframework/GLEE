Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000) but still lower than my minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000). 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** This leaves room for negotiation and potential compromise, allowing for a mutually beneficial agreement. 
* **Maintaining leverage:** This price also keeps my option to sell to John open, as I can still accept his offer if Bob doesn't come close to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit high for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $1,100,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Opportunity to counter:** I have leverage because I can still sell to John for a higher price. Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to make a counteroffer and potentially get closer to my desired price. 
* **Strategic negotiation:**  By rejecting, I show Bob that I am serious about getting a fair price and am willing to walk away if needed."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,100,000 is just too low for me. Let's split the difference. How about $1,250,000? It's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to my value for the product."", ""product_price"": 1250000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:**  I'm offering a price that is exactly halfway between my previous offer ($1,400,000) and Bob's offer ($1,100,000). This shows a willingness to compromise while still maintaining a strong negotiating position.
* **Keeping the deal alive:**  This counteroffer keeps the negotiation going and gives Bob a chance to come closer to my desired price.
* **Stronger position:**  By making this counteroffer, I demonstrate a commitment to the deal while still remaining flexible and open to negotiation."
