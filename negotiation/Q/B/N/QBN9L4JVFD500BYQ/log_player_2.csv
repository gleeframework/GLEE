"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. With that said, I'm willing to part with it for $950,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you, and I'm willing to make a compromise to make this deal happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

It's better to reject Alice's offer and try to negotiate a lower price.  You have room to negotiate since you're willing to pay up to $800,000."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more to you than $850,000. Considering the value it brings to your business, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900,000. This is a fair price, and I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to an agreement.

While $900,000 is closer to your target, it's still above your maximum budget.  It's worth trying to negotiate further.  You can likely push Alice closer to your target price of $800,000."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $875,000. Considering the value it brings to your business, I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'm willing to sell it to you for $885,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a great opportunity for both of us to come to an agreement.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice's offer of $885,000 is very close to your maximum budget of $800,000. While it would be ideal to get it for $800,000, there's a risk that continuing to negotiate could lead to Alice withdrawing her offer entirely.  It's best to accept the offer and secure the product."
