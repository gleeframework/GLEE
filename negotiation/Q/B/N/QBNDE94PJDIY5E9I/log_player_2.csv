"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $1,300,000 is still within your budget, it's not the best deal. You can likely get a better price by rejecting Alice's offer and making a counteroffer. There's a good chance you can negotiate down to a price closer to your maximum of $1,200,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Explanation:**

This counteroffer is a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer of $1,300,000. It signals your seriousness about purchasing the product while also leaving room for further negotiation. This offer is still within your budget and might be appealing to Alice since it's closer to her desired price of $1,500,000."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,250,000 is only $50,000 more than what John is offering.  While it's still slightly above your ideal price, it's likely that further negotiation would result in a very small decrease in price. Therefore, accepting this offer is the most reasonable choice, as it allows you to acquire the product quickly and for a price that's very close to your maximum budget."
