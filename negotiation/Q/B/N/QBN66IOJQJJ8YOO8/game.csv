"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm very interested in the product, but $1,100,000 is a little too high for my budget. Would you consider $850,000?",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $850,000. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm not willing to sell it to you at that price. I'm willing to consider a price between $1,100,000 and $1,200,000, which is what I believe it's truly worth. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $1,150,000?",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $1,000,000. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still not comfortable selling the product at that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,150,000 and $1,000,000, which would be $1,075,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the efforts we've put into this negotiation so far.",1075000.0,Alice,5,
