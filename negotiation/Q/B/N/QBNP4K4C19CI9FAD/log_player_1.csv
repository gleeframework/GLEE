Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", ""product_price"": 119}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($100) as possible without going below our minimum ($120).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $119 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially counter-offer, while still securing a profit if he accepts outright. 
* **Guaranteed Alternative:** We have John as a backup buyer, ensuring we don't have to go below $120.

This strategy aims to get the best possible price from Bob while having a safety net in place."
