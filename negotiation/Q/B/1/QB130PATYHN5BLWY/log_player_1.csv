Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $19,000. I believe it holds significant value that could benefit you. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 19000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Valuation:** I don't actually know how much Bob values the product, so I need to start with a price that allows room for negotiation while aiming higher than his potential value.
* **Anchoring:** Starting with a higher price ($19,000) sets an anchor. Even if Bob negotiates down, the starting point influences his perception of a ""good deal.""
* **Alternative Option:**  I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, so I'm not desperate. This allows me to be firmer in my negotiation with Bob.

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. I'm prepared to negotiate with Bob depending on his response and willingness to engage."
