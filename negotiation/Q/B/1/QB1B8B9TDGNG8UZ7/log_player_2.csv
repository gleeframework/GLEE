# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to acquire this valuable product for a price of $1,250,000. This represents a significant opportunity for you, as the product is worth $1,200,000 to you. I'm confident this offer will be mutually beneficial. However, I'm also willing to sell the product to another buyer for $1,200,000, so you'll need to decide quickly. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000.
