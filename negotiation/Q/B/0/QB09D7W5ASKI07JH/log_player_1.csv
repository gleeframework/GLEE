Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm happy to offer you this product. Given its value, I believe a price of $1,200,000 is fair. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1200000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $800,000, you can afford to start high. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob counters.
* **Testing the Waters:**  This initial offer gauges Bob's interest level. If he accepts immediately, you've secured a significant profit. 
* **John as Leverage:** While you don't explicitly mention John, the knowledge that you have other options allows you to be firmer in your pricing. 

**Important Note:** This is just one strategy. You could open with a slightly lower price if you want to appear more flexible or if you believe a quicker sale is more beneficial."
