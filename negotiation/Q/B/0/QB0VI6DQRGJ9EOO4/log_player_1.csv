Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I believe a price of $1,100,000 is fair.  What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Aiming closer to Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000) maximizes potential profit. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The offer allows for some negotiation downward while still staying well above your minimum acceptable price.
* **Justification:**  The message hints at the product's value to justify the high price without revealing your absolute bottom line.
* **Alternative:** You have a guaranteed sale at $800,000, giving you leverage to hold firm if Bob tries to lowball you. 

**Important Note:**  This is just one possible strategy. Gauge Bob's personality and negotiation style throughout the process to adjust your approach if needed."
