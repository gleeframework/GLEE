Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, so you won't accept less.
* **Bob's Valuation:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob. He won't pay more.
* **The Zone of Possible Agreement (ZOPA):**  Exists between $1,200,001 and $1,499,999. Any price within this range could potentially work for both of you.

**Strategy**

You want to aim high but leave Bob feeling like he got a deal. A price too close to $1,200,000 might make him suspicious.

**Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you an exclusive opportunity to acquire this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,350,000. I believe this represents a fair offer for something of this caliber."",
""product_price"": 1350000 
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Direct and Positive:**  The message is clear and upbeat about the product.
* **Justification:**  Phrases like ""unique value"" and ""fair offer"" are used without being overly aggressive.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $1,350,000 leaves space for Bob to potentially negotiate down, while still keeping you well above your minimum. 

**Important Note:**  This is just one possible offer.  You could adjust the price and message based on your assessment of Bob's personality and negotiation style."
