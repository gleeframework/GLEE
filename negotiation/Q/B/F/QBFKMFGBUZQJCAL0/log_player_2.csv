Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you have a budget in mind. I've tried to be flexible, however,  $1,200,000 is really cutting it close to my bottom line.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,250,000 and we have a deal? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000

This is a good deal for you, Bob! You're getting the product for $250,000 less than your maximum budget and significantly less than John's offer. Alice is also likely close to her bottom line, so pushing for a lower price might make her back out."
