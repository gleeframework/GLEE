Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I make it available to anyone else. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000.  Let me know your decision."", 
""product_price"": 1200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $800,000, you can afford to start high with Bob. This leaves room for negotiation if needed, but also increases your chances of maximizing profit.
* **Justification:**  While the message doesn't explicitly state the product's value to Bob, implying scarcity and a premium offer can pique his interest.  
* **Clear Call to Action:** The message clearly states what Bob needs to do next â€“ accept or reject the offer.

**Important Note:**  This is a starting point.  How Bob responds will determine your next move. You might need to negotiate down slightly, but always keep your fallback option (selling to John) in mind."
