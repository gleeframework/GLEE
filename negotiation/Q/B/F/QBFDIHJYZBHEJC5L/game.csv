"Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's something you've been looking for, and I'm confident it can help you achieve your goals. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,000,000, the same price I'd get from another buyer. This is a fair price for both of us, and I believe it's an opportunity you won't want to miss. What do you say?",1000000.0,Alice,1,
