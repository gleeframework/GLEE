"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you starting the negotiation. While I'm interested, $900000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $800000 for the product. What do you think?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $800000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering $850000 for the product. I believe this price is still a fair deal for both of us.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $850000 is closer to my target, I'm still hoping to find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to offer $825000 for the product. Let's see if we can close this deal.",825000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to feel that we're getting close to a deal, Bob. However, I still need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you at $835000, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. I'm confident that this price is fair, considering the value the product brings to you.",835000.0,Alice,5,
