"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I'm interested in the product, $15,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to offer $10,500 for it. What do you think?",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,500 is significantly lower than what I have in mind.  This product offers a lot of value, and I believe a price closer to $14,000 is more reflective of that. What are your thoughts?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you value the product highly, but $14,000 is still out of my range.  I'm willing to go up to $11,500. It's a fair price for both of us.  Let's find some common ground.",11500.0,Bob,4,
