"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $175. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 
 
I'm starting high, knowing the product is worth more to me than Bob.  This gives me room to negotiate down if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I'm looking for something closer to $80. Can we meet somewhere in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $100 is better than Bob's initial offer of $80, it's still significantly lower than my minimum of $150. I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $100 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $130.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

I'm lowering my price a bit to show I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm still holding out for a price that's closer to my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose $120 as my counteroffer. It's still below your initial asking price, but I believe it's a fair compromise given the product's value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $120 is closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a little more. I'll reject his offer and see if we can reach a compromise in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see you're getting closer to my desired price. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $125.  Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 125}
```

I'm offering a price that's right in the middle of our last two offers. This shows good faith and hopefully convinces Bob to accept."
