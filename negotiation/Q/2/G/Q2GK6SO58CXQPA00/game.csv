"Bob, I have a product that I believe would be extremely valuable to you.  Based on its potential in your business, I believe it's worth at least $1,500,000.  I'm willing to offer it to you at a price of $1,400,000.  This represents a significant discount, and it's a price I'm confident we can both be happy with.  Let me know what you think!",1400000.0,Alice,1,
