"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested in the product, but $100 is a bit high for my budget. Would you consider $60?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $100 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about we settle on $90? It's a great compromise that still reflects the product's value to me.",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you working with me on the price, Alice.  While $90 is closer, it's still a bit of a stretch for me.  How about $70? ",70.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $70 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to make another concession. How about we meet at $85? It's a fair price that takes into account the value I place on the product, and it's closer to my original offer.",85.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $85 is still a bit more than I'd like to spend. I'm willing to pay $75, but that's my absolute limit.",75.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that $75 is your absolute limit, Bob, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for that price. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. How about we meet at $80? It's the best I can do, and I think it's still a fair price for the product.",80.0,Alice,7,
