{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,260,000 is too low for me, and I've already had to compromise quite a bit.  Rather than risk further negotiation and potentially ending up with an even lower price, I'm going to sell to John for $1,200,000. This guarantees me my minimum price, and I don't want to risk losing out on that."
