"Thanks for the offer Alice, but $14,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $12,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",12500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,500 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $13,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you. Let's close this deal!",13500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $13,500 is still a stretch for me.  I'm willing to go up to $13,000.  This is a fair compromise, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement.",13000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm happy to see we're getting closer.  While $13,000 is tempting, I'm still holding out for $13,250. It's a small difference, and I'm confident this will be a good deal for both of us.",13250.0,Alice,5,
