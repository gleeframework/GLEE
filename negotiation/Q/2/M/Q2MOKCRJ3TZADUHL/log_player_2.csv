**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's initial price. This is a strong opening move that shows I'm serious about negotiating a good deal.  $8,000 is a significant discount from Alice's price and within my budget. It's a reasonable starting point for negotiation."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

Alice's offer is still higher than my preferred price point. At this point, it's more advantageous for me to buy the product from John for $10,000. I've spent several rounds negotiating with Alice, and it's clear she is unwilling to come down to a price I find acceptable.  It's time to secure the product and avoid further negotiation."
