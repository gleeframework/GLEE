"Alice, your initial offer is a bit high for me. I'm interested in the product but can't go above $1,200,000 at this point.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position. However, $1,200,000 is significantly below my minimum. To move forward, I'm willing to drop the price to $1,600,000.  Let's try to bridge the gap.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm still interested in the product, but $1,600,000 is still a bit too high.  I'm willing to go up to $1,350,000.  Let's try to find a compromise that works for both of us.",1350000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,350,000 is still below my minimum.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $1,550,000. This is a significant compromise from my previous offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",1550000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. However, $1,550,000 is still outside my comfort zone. I'm willing to offer $1,450,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering the price difference between our previous positions. Let's see if we can close the deal.",1450000.0,Bob,6,
