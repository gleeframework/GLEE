"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $850,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product. Let's see if we can work something out.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $750,000 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my original offer, but I need at least $825,000 to make this work. Let's meet in the middle.",825000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you being flexible.  $825,000 is still a bit high for me. How about $780,000?  It's a fair compromise, and we can both move forward with the deal.",780000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. $780,000 is closer, but I'm still a bit off. How about we split the difference and go with $800,000? It's a fair price considering the product's value, and we can both be happy with the deal.",800000.0,Alice,5,
