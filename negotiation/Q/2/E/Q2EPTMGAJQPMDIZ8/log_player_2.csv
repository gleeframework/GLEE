# Alice's message: I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob! I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. How about we meet at $113? I think that's a fair price for the product, considering its value to you.

You've reached a point where the negotiations are getting close, but Alice is still unwilling to come down to a price you're comfortable with.
