,,Bob,3,RejectOffer,
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, and I'm happy to work with you.  However, $110 is still a bit too high for me. How about we settle on $108?  It's a good compromise, and I'm sure we can both be happy with that price.",108.0,Bob,4,,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $112.50? It's a bit higher than your last offer, but I think it's still a fair price for the product.",112.5,Alice,5,,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer,
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $112.50 is still a bit out of my budget.  I'm happy to meet you halfway again at $110. This would be a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can both walk away satisfied.",110.0,Bob,6,,

"I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob! I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. How about we meet at $113? I think that's a fair price for the product, considering its value to you.",113.0,Alice,7,,
