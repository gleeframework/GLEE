"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're interested in the product, but I'm not sure I can meet you at $12000. I'm willing to make a compromise, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for the product. I'm thinking more along the lines of $14000. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I'm still a bit above my budget, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. Would you consider $13000?",13000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to accept $13000. I'm willing to make another compromise, but I need to get closer to my target price. I'm thinking of $14500. This is a fair price considering the product's value and what I've seen in the market. What do you think?",14500.0,Alice,5,

"I understand your concerns, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to go up to $13500, but I think that's the highest I can go. Would you consider meeting me at this price?",13500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob, but I'm still not convinced that $13500 is the right price for this product. I'm willing to make one more compromise, but I need to get closer to my target. I'm thinking of $14750. This is a fair price considering the product's value and what I've seen in the market. What do you think?",14750.0,Alice,7,

"I'm starting to get a bit frustrated, Alice. I've already gone as high as I'm willing to go. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $12000 and $14750. Would you consider $13375?",13375.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm still not convinced that $13375 is the right price for this product. I'm willing to make one last compromise, but I need to get closer to my target. I'm thinking of $14900. This is a fair price considering the product's value and what I've seen in the market. What do you think?",14900.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I'm sorry, Alice, but I've reached my limit. I'm not willing to go any higher than $12000. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to walk away and consider buying from John for $12000.",12000.0,Bob,10,
