"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the opportunity, $950,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, which is still a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $850,000 is a bit below your target, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $920,000. This is a compromise that I believe will satisfy both of us.",920000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $920,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to go up to $880,000, which is a fair price for both of us. Let's try to find a middle ground.",880000.0,Bob,4,
