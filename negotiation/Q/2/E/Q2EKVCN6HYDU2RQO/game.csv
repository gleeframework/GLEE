"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product! It's worth $1000000 to you, and I'm confident it will be a great asset.  I'm starting with a price of $1100000.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me. Can you consider this counteroffer?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $900000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down slightly from my initial offer.  How about $1050000? This gives us both some room to compromise.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $1050000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our initial offers. How about $975000? This seems like a fair middle ground.",975000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob,  I appreciate your continued negotiation.  I'm willing to meet you halfway between our current positions.  $1012500 seems like a fair price.  This allows us both to make a good deal.  Let's close this and move on.",1012500.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, Alice. However, $1012500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $990000, but no higher. Can you consider this counteroffer?",990000.0,Bob,6,
