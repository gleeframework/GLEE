{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $850,000.  This is a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 850000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price slightly above the product's value to Bob. This gives me room to negotiate downwards.
* **Reasoning:** I'm providing a reason for the price, appealing to the product's value to Bob.
* **Openness:**  I'm leaving the door open for negotiation by asking for Bob's thoughts.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and decide whether to accept it or make a counteroffer myself.
* If negotiations stall or I feel like I'm not getting a good price, I'll switch to John, who is a guaranteed $800,000 sale."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product. Let me know if you're interested. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  His offer of $750,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $800,000.
* **Potential for better deal:**  I believe there's still room for negotiation to get closer to my desired price.  
* **John as backup:**  Even if negotiations with Bob fail, I have John as a guaranteed buyer, so I'm not under pressure to accept a low offer.

**Next Steps:**

* I will counteroffer Bob with a price closer to my desired price, but still lower than my initial offer."

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer slightly lower:** I've lowered my price slightly from the initial offer but kept it above my minimum acceptable price of $800,000.

* **Openness to agreement:**  I'm again leaving the door open for negotiation with a positive tone.
