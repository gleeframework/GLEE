"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value, I'm asking for $11,000. I think you'll find this a fair price considering the benefits it offers. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  $11,000 is still more than Bob is willing to pay. It's better to try and negotiate with Alice first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $11,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for this product. This is a fair price considering the value to me and leaves room for you to make a profit.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you countering. While $9,500 is a generous offer, the value of this product is significant, and I'm aiming for something closer to my initial ask. How about we meet halfway at $10,250? This feels like a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible. $10,250 is still more than Bob is willing to pay, and it's only slightly less than Alice's initial offer.  It's worth trying to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $10,250 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $9,750, which is a fair compromise and still leaves you with a decent profit margin.  Let's try to close this deal."", ""product_price"": 9750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see we're getting closer.  You clearly see the value in this product. How about we split the difference again and settle at $10,000 even?  This would be my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $10,000 is closer to Bob's ideal price, there's still room to negotiate.  It's worth trying to get a bit closer to $9,750, Bob's last offer, before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I appreciate your persistence. $10,000 is still a bit high for me. However, I'm willing to go up to $9,875. Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9875}
