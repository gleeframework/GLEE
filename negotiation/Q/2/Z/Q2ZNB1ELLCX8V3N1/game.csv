"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value, I'm asking for $11,000. I think you'll find this a fair price considering the benefits it offers.",11000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $11,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for this product. This is a fair price considering the value to me and leaves room for you to make a profit.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you countering. While $9,500 is a generous offer, the value of this product is significant, and I'm aiming for something closer to my initial ask. How about we meet halfway at $10,250? This feels like a fair compromise.",10250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $10,250 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $9,750, which is a fair compromise and still leaves you with a decent profit margin.  Let's try to close this deal.",9750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see we're getting closer.  You clearly see the value in this product. How about we split the difference again and settle at $10,000 even?  This would be my final offer.",10000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate your persistence. $10,000 is still a bit high for me. However, I'm willing to go up to $9,875. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",9875.0,Bob,6,
