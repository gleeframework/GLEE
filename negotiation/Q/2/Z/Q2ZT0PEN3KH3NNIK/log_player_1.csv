Round 2
Bob's offer:

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that this is your final offer, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between your offer and my previous counteroffer. How about we try $9,875? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,875.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,875
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

**Reasoning:**

While I'd ideally like to get $10,000, Bob is very clearly unwilling to go above $10,000. Accepting his offer of $9,875 secures a significant profit above my minimum ($8,000) and avoids the risk of him walking away entirely in further rounds."
