"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm confident you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $150. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else. What do you think?",150.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice! While I appreciate the value you're placing on this product, $150 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. I'm happy to offer you $100 for it, but that's my final offer.",100.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $150 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $125. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll find it's still a fantastic deal. What do you think?",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $125 is still a little more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $115, and that's my absolute final offer.",115.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $125 was still a bit too high for you, Bob, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $120. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal. What do you think?",120.0,Alice,5,
