{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible.  While Alice's offer is better than John's, it's still above Bob's maximum budget.  By rejecting the offer, Bob can try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is trying to get as close to his maximum budget as possible while still leaving some room for negotiation.  Offering $10,500 is a reasonable starting point, as it's significantly lower than Alice's offer but still leaves some potential profit for Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's counteroffer is still above Bob's maximum budget of $10,000.  At this point, it's clear that Alice is not willing to go lower, and it's more beneficial for Bob to simply buy the product from John for $10,000.  This ensures Bob gets the product at his desired price without further negotiation."
