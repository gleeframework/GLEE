"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,500,000.  It's a great deal for both of us, as the product is worth that much to you. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* The product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob, and Alice is offering it for the same price. This means there is no potential for savings for Bob.
* If Bob rejects the offer, he can buy the product from John for the same price. 

Since there is no benefit to accepting Alice's offer, Bob should reject it and buy from John."
