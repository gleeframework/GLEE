"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this exceptional product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing an initial offer of $1,200,000. I believe this price reflects the true worth of the asset.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think your initial offer is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However,  $900,000 undervalues the product's unique features and potential ROI. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This is my final offer, as I already have another interested buyer.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your concerns, but I'm still not convinced that $1,100,000 is a fair price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I'd like to make a new counteroffer of $950,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value.",950000.0,Bob,4,
