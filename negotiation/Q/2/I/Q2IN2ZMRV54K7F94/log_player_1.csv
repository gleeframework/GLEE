Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think your initial offer is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However,  $900,000 undervalues the product's unique features and potential ROI. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This is my final offer, as I already have another interested buyer."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your concerns, but I'm still not convinced that $1,100,000 is a fair price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I'd like to make a new counteroffer of $950,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is unlikely to significantly increase his offer.  Selling to John guarantees the $1,000,000, which is a better outcome than continuing to negotiate with Bob and risking a lower final price."
