"I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob. However, I've got a lot of interest in this product and I'm not willing to go as low as $7500. I can do $8400, which is a compromise between my original price and your offer. What do you think?",8400.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the compromise, Alice, but $8400 is still a bit too high for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $7200?",7200.0,Bob,4,

"I can see you're really interested in this product, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I've got to make a living, and $7200 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $7200 and $8400, so I'll offer it to you for $7800. What do you think?",7800.0,Alice,5,
