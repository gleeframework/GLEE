"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $6,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $8,500, which still gives you a good deal. Let's find a middle ground.",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  How about we meet in the middle at $7,500? I think that's a fair deal for both of us.",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. I can go down to $8,000. This is a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away happy. Let me know if you're interested.",8000.0,Alice,5,
