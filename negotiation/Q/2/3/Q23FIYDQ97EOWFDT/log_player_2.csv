"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. This is a great price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is too high. There's a good chance we can negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $6,000?"", 
""product_price"": 6000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  By offering $6,000, we're aiming significantly lower than Alice's asking price. This gives us room to negotiate upwards while staying well below our $8,000 limit.
* **Leaving Room:** We want Alice to counter-offer. If our initial offer is too close to $8,000, she might reject it outright.
* **Polite and Interested:**  We maintain a friendly tone and express continued interest in the product. This encourages a positive negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest but $6,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $8,500, which still gives you a good deal. Let's find a middle ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice came down in price, $8,500 is still above our maximum budget and what John is offering. We have some wiggle room to negotiate further and try to meet somewhere between $8,000 and $8,500."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  How about we meet in the middle at $7,500? I think that's a fair deal for both of us."",
""product_price"": 7500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** By offering $7,500, we're suggesting a compromise that sits directly between her last offer ($8,500) and our previous offer ($6,000). This shows willingness to negotiate while still pushing for a lower price.
* **Fairness:**  Highlighting the ""fair deal"" aspect can encourage Alice to accept, as it frames the negotiation as mutually beneficial. 
* **Approaching the Limit:** We're getting closer to our $8,000 limit, signaling to Alice that we're serious about purchasing but need her to move closer to our range."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. I can go down to $8,000. This is a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away happy. Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has met our maximum budget of $8,000, which is also the same price John is offering. There's no further room for negotiation to get a better deal, so it makes sense to accept Alice's offer now."
