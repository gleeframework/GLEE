"Hi Bob, I'm selling a fantastic product that I think you'd be very interested in. I'm offering it to you for $13,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident it's worth more to you than that. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $13,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $10,500?",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $12,000, which is still a good deal for you considering the value of this product. Let's meet in the middle.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me. $12,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something around $11,000. Would you be open to $11,250?",11250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I understand you're trying to get the best price, and I'm willing to work with you. How about we split the difference and go with $11,500?  That's a fair price for both of us, and it gets us closer to a deal.",11500.0,Alice,5,
