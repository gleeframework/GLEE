Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is significantly above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  This price is fair considering its value to me, and allows for a profitable transaction for both of us. Let's see if we can work something out.
