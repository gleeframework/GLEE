"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. My initial offer is $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is significantly above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  This price is fair considering its value to me, and allows for a profitable transaction for both of us. Let's see if we can work something out.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're looking to keep costs down, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a bit more than that. My counteroffer is $1,050,000. I think this is a reasonable compromise that still allows for a profitable transaction for both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $850,000.  I believe this price reflects the value of the product to both of us, and allows for a mutually beneficial transaction.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're sticking to your previous offer, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you at $925,000, which is still a compromise, but closer to my minimum price. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",925000.0,Alice,5,
