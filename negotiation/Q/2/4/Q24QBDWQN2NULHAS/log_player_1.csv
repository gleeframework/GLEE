Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

This offer is based on the following logic:

* **My minimum acceptable price is $8,000.**  If Bob rejects, I can still sell to John for that amount.
* **I want to maximize my profit.**  By offering $9,000, I'm leaving room for negotiation and hoping Bob might be willing to pay a little extra. 

This is a calculated risk.  If Bob values the product at less than $9,000, he'll reject the offer and I'll get $8,000 from John.  However, if Bob values the product at more than $9,000, this offer gives me the best chance of getting the most money."
