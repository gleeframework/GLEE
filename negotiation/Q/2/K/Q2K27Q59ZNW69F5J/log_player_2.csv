While $7,200 is a good price, I'm still trying to get the best deal possible.  I'll make one more counteroffer to see if we can get closer to my target price."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

This is a small adjustment from Alice's offer, demonstrating our willingness to compromise.  If she rejects, we can then evaluate the situation further and decide if it's worth buying from John."

Alice is clearly not going to budge much further, and while I'd like to get it lower, $7,300 is a good deal considering the alternative is $15,000 from John. It's time to close the deal."
