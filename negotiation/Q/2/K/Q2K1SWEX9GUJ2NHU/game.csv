"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $105. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $105 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, how about $110?  That's still a good deal for you, and it's the best I can do.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $110 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $105 and $110, which would be $107.50. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",107.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $107.50 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $109. It's a good deal for both of us, and it's the final price I'm willing to consider.",109.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to make a good deal, but $109 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $108, but no higher. Can you meet me at that price?",108.0,Bob,6,
