"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm still not willing to part with the product for $900000. Considering its value to me is $1200000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering you the product for $1050000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a great opportunity for us to come to an agreement. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate the compromise, Alice, but I'm still a bit above $1050000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I was thinking more along the lines of $980000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",980000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $980000. Considering its value to me is $1200000, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm offering you the product for $1020000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.
