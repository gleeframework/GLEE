This is a tough one, but it's time to accept Alice's offer. Here's why:

* **Alice is firm:**  Her message suggests she won't budge further.  Continuing the negotiation might lead to her walking away.
* **Time is running out:** You're at round 7 of 10. While you could keep trying, the risk of Alice walking away increases.
* **Savings are good:** $825,000 is a significant saving compared to John's $1,200,000 price.

While you could try to squeeze out a little more, the risk of losing the deal and having to pay John's higher price outweighs the potential savings."
