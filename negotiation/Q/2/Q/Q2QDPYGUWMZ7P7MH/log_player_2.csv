"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really love it! I'm starting with a price of $115. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Since the product is worth $120 to him, he should aim for a price lower than that.  Alice's initial offer of $115 is too high, so Bob should reject it and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. $115 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $105. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 105} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer but I'm looking for a bit more.  How about $110? It's a great deal for you and still leaves me a little room to make a profit. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming to pay less than $110.  While Alice's offer is lower than her initial offer, it's still above Bob's target.  He should continue to negotiate for a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but I'm still not quite there. How about $108?  I'm really interested in this product and I think this price is fair for both of us."", ""product_price"": 108} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, and I'm trying to get the best value for my product. How about we split the difference and go with $109?  It's just a dollar more than your offer, and I think it's a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $109. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $109
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value:**  The product is worth $120 to Bob, and Alice is offering it for $109. This is a good deal for Bob, as he's getting it for less than his maximum price.
* **Negotiation:** Alice has been flexible and has come down in price.  While Bob could continue negotiating, the difference between his last offer and Alice's offer is only $1. It's likely that further negotiation would be time-consuming and might not yield a significantly better price.
* **Risk:**  If Bob rejects Alice's offer, he risks losing the deal.  Alice might become less willing to negotiate, or Bob might end up paying more to John if he decides to buy from him.

By accepting Alice's offer, Bob gets a good price while minimizing the risk of losing the deal."
