"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a unique product that I believe would be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $15000. This is a significant discount from its true worth, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is exactly the same price as buying from John. Since your goal is to save as much money as possible, there's no benefit to accepting Alice's offer. There's a chance you might get a better deal by rejecting and seeing if Alice lowers her price or if you can find another seller."
