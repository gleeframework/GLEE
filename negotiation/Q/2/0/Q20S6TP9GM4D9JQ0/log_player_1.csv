"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product.  Given its unique benefits, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,200,000. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement."",
""product_price"": 2200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations above your desired price. This provides room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest and price sensitivity.
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes the product's value without explicitly mentioning your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for you to potentially justify a lower price later in the negotiation.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message expresses a willingness to find a mutually beneficial agreement, signaling that you're open to negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product, but my budget is limited. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,200,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's counteroffer is significantly below your minimum acceptable price. While it's closer to his perceived value, you have plenty of room to negotiate and time before considering John's offer.  Rejecting this offer signals that you're serious about a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I understand your budget constraints, the value of this product is significantly higher than your current offer.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000.  This reflects the true worth of what's being offered."",
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Concession:** You've made a significant concession from your initial price, demonstrating flexibility and a desire to reach an agreement.
* **Anchoring:** By starting high, you are anchoring the negotiation closer to your desired price range.  This makes the new price seem more reasonable in comparison.
* **Value Emphasis:** You are reiterating the product's value, subtly reminding Bob that his initial offer might be undervaluing it. 
* **Urgency:**  While not explicitly stated, a smaller price reduction can sometimes imply that you are getting closer to your bottom line."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,600,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

We're getting closer! Bob's offer is now above your safety net price from John. However, you still have room to negotiate and potentially secure a better deal. By rejecting this offer, you signal that you believe the product is worth more while keeping the negotiation alive."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're getting closer. I appreciate you recognizing the value of this product.  To be frank, I have another potential buyer, but I believe in giving you a fair chance.  I'm willing to accept $1,750,000. This is my final offer."",
""product_price"": 1750000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Introducing Competition:** By mentioning another buyer, you create a sense of urgency and scarcity without revealing John's specific offer.
* **Finality:** Stating this is your final offer strengthens your position and signals that you're serious about closing the deal at this price.
* **Justification:** You're not just throwing out a number - you're positioning this price as a result of giving Bob a ""fair chance"" before moving on. 
* **Strategic Positioning:**  This price gives you a significant profit over John's offer while still being potentially attractive to Bob if he's truly interested."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your persistence in negotiating. I am willing to counteroffer at $1,700,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is a good deal! While you could potentially push for a bit more, Bob is now very close to your ""final offer,"" and you've already surpassed John's offer by a considerable amount. Accepting avoids the risk of Bob walking away and ensures a very profitable outcome for you."
