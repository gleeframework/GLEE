# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think the price is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1200000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. I'm willing to negotiate further if you're willing to meet me halfway. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.
