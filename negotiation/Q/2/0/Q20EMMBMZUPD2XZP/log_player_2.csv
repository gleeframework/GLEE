"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to acquire this valuable product for a price that reflects its true worth. I understand its value to you is $1200000, and I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. Please consider my offer of $1150000. This price allows you to secure this asset at a significant discount, while still ensuring a fair return for me. I'm open to discussing any concerns you may have. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $1,150,000 is significantly lower than your maximum budget of $1,200,000.  Accepting this offer allows you to secure the product while saving $50,000.  Rejecting the offer would mean buying from John at your maximum budget, so accepting Alice's offer is the most financially advantageous option."
