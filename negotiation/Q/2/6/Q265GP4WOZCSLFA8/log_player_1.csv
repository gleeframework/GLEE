Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

I'm starting with my ideal price, $1,000,000. This is the price I'd get from John, so it sets the baseline for my negotiation with Bob. It's unlikely he'll accept this, but it gives me room to maneuver."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $850,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly less than what I could get from John or my own valuation. I'm going to reject this offer and counter with my own."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

I'm offering $950,000. It's a compromise between my ideal price and Bob's offer. It's still a good price for me, and it might be tempting enough for Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $900,000 is a good compromise. It's closer to my valuation than his previous offer, and while I'd prefer to get $1,000,000, it's not worth risking the deal by continuing to negotiate or selling to John."
