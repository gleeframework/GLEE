Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $140. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to $150 as possible, knowing John is a guaranteed sale. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $140 leaves room for Bob to potentially counter-offer if he's interested, while still securing a good profit for you. 
* **Avoid Appearing Desperate:** Offering it at $150 to Bob right away might make him hesitant, thinking it's overpriced. A slightly lower price can be more appealing.

It's important to note that this is just one strategy.  Depending on your knowledge of Bob's negotiating style and how much you want to prioritize a quick sale, you could adjust the initial offer."
