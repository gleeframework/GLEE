"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product! I'm excited to make you an offer. After careful consideration, I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11,500. I believe this is a fair price considering the value it will bring to your business. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You should reject Alice's offer. You're aiming to get the product for $10,000 or less, and Alice's offer is above that. There's room for negotiation, so rejecting the initial offer is the best move."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $11,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Considering the value I place on this product, I'm willing to offer $10,500.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're looking for a better price, and I'm willing to consider it. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $10,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $11,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value it will bring to your business. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $11,000 is closer to your target, you're still trying to get the product for less. You can keep negotiating, and you still have the option to buy from John.  Rejection allows for further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm ready to offer $10,750.  I believe this price is fair and reflects the value I place on the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 10750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're looking for a better price, and I'm willing to consider it. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $10,750. I'm willing to offer the product to you for $10,900. I believe this is a fair price considering the value it will bring to your business. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

You're close to your target of $10,000, but Alice's offer is still too high.  Rejecting the offer allows you to continue negotiating and potentially get the product for closer to your desired price. Remember, you have the option to buy from John if negotiations fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, we're getting closer. I'm willing to offer $10,800 for the product. I believe this is a fair price, and I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10800}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that we're close, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,800. I'm willing to offer the product to you for $10,950. I believe this is a fair price considering the value it will bring to your business. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,950. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,950
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's offer is still above your target price, and with only 3 rounds left, the risk of not getting a better deal is high.  At this point, it's better to secure the product from John for $10,000 and avoid the potential of further negotiation that might not lead to a better result."
