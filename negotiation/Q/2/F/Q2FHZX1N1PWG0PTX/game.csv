"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable item. I believe it's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to start the negotiation with a price of $15000. What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the opportunity, $15000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in this product but my budget is closer to $8000. Would you be willing to consider a price closer to that?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $8000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $12000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $12000 is still a bit out of my reach. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $9500? This is a fair price that reflects the value I see in the product.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $9500 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to make another concession. I'm thinking of a price of $11000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $11000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $10000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us both to walk away happy. Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,6,
