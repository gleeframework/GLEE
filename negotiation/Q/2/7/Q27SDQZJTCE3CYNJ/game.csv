"Bob, I understand your position. While $500,000 is below my desired price, I'm willing to compromise. Let's meet in the middle at $700,000.  It's still a great deal for you, and it allows us to both benefit from this transaction.",700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the compromise, but $700,000 is still a bit high for me. How about $600,000? That's a fair offer considering its true value.",600000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that $600,000 is a good price for you, but it's still not enough for me.  I'm willing to come down to $650,000, but that's my final offer. If we can't agree, I'll be moving on to another buyer.",650000.0,Alice,5,
