"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $800,000 to you, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset to your business. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Alice, your product is a bit too pricey for me at the moment. I'm willing to offer $500,000."",
 ""product_price"": 500000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position. While $500,000 is below my desired price, I'm willing to compromise. Let's meet in the middle at $700,000.  It's still a great deal for you, and it allows us to both benefit from this transaction. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While $700,000 is closer to our target, we're still in early rounds. Alice is showing a willingness to negotiate, so there's a good chance we can get the price lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the compromise, but $700,000 is still a bit high for me. How about $600,000? That's a fair offer considering its true value."",
 ""product_price"": 600000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that $600,000 is a good price for you, but it's still not enough for me.  I'm willing to come down to $650,000, but that's my final offer. If we can't agree, I'll be moving on to another buyer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $650,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice is signaling this is her final offer. While we might get her down a little more, it's getting risky. $650,000 is a decent price, and it's better to secure the deal now than potentially miss out and have to buy from John at $800,000."
