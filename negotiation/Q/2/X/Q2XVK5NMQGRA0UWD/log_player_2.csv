"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for an introductory price of $110. Don't miss out on this exclusive opportunity! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $110 is a good price, there's a chance I could get it for even less. I'll try a counteroffer to see if Alice is willing to go lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. That's a decent price, but I'm on a bit of a budget. Would you consider $90?"",
""product_price"": 90
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  I'm starting with a significantly lower offer ($90) to gauge Alice's flexibility. There's a good chance she'll counter, giving me room to negotiate upward. 
* **Polite and Reasonable:** My message is polite and explains my position (budget constraints) without being confrontational. This helps maintain a positive negotiation environment.
* **Leaving Room to Move:**  Even if Alice rejects this offer, I have room to increase my price in subsequent rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest in our product, Bob. While I understand your budget constraints, I would like to counter your offer with a price of $95. This still offers a good deal compared to the market value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Great Deal:**  $95 is a fantastic price, a significant discount from both Alice's original offer and John's price. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** While I *might* be able to negotiate a few more dollars off, it's not worth the risk of Alice retracting the offer or me missing out entirely.
* **Objective Met:** My goal was to get a good price, and $95 meets that goal exceptionally well."
