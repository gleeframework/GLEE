{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's a bit above Bob's perceived value, but leaves room for negotiation if he's interested.  It's also important to keep John in mind as a backup buyer, so we don't want to go too high and risk losing him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your product is interesting, but $11,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for it. What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is higher than our minimum acceptable price, it's still lower than our ideal goal. We're going to try to get closer to $10,000. We'll send Bob a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $9,500 is a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $10,250?  I'm confident you'll find this product worth the investment."", ""product_price"": 10250} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm still interested, but $10,250 is still a bit high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $10,000? That would be a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is our minimum acceptable price, and it's the same price we can get from John. It's a good deal for both of us, and it saves us from further negotiations."
