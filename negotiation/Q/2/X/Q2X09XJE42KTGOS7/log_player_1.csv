Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000} 
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with an ambitious price of $1,500,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable value of $1,000,000. 

Here's my reasoning:

* **Maximize potential gains:**  A higher initial price gives me more room to negotiate downwards if necessary.
* **Gauge Bob's interest:** This price will quickly tell me how serious Bob is about buying the product and how much value he places on it.
* **Plan for John:**  If Bob rejects this offer, I have the option to move on to John and secure a guaranteed $1,000,000.

I'm prepared to negotiate further, but I believe this initial offer is a good starting point for a profitable deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $1,000,000 is my minimum acceptable value, I'm not willing to settle for that just yet. I want to see if I can get closer to my initial offer of $1,500,000. 

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can:

* **Continue negotiating:**  I can counter with a price closer to my desired range and see if Bob is willing to compromise.
* **Test Bob's limits:**  His low offer suggests he may be willing to pay more, but I need to see how far he's willing to go.
* **Maintain leverage:** By rejecting his offer, I show that I'm not desperate to sell and that I have options (like selling to John).

I'm confident that I can secure a better price through further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Explanation:**

My counteroffer of $1,250,000 represents a compromise between my initial ambitious price and Bob's lowball offer. Here's why I chose this amount:

* **Reasonable compromise:**  It's significantly higher than Bob's offer but lower than my original price, showing a willingness to negotiate.
* **Stronger position:**  By not immediately accepting his offer, I've demonstrated my desire for a better price and maintained some leverage.
* **Test Bob's flexibility:** This offer allows me to gauge Bob's willingness to compromise. If he accepts, it's a good outcome. If he rejects, I have more information to work with in the next round.

I'm hoping this counteroffer will be attractive enough for Bob while still allowing me to earn a substantial profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

This time, I'm going to accept Bob's offer. Here's why:

* **Significant profit:**  While not my initial asking price, $1,150,000 is still a substantial profit, exceeding my minimum acceptable value of $1,000,000.
* **Negotiation fatigue:** Further negotiations with Bob may drag on and could potentially lead to a lower price.
* **Time is money:**  Continuing to negotiate could cost me valuable time, which is ultimately money. It's better to secure a good deal now rather than risk losing more.

By accepting Bob's offer, I can finalize the sale and move on to other opportunities."
