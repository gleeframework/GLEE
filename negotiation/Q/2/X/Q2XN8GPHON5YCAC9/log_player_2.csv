"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think you'll really love it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $90 is within your budget, it's still higher than the product's worth to Alice ($80).  There's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you're enthusiastic about the product, but $90 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $85.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 85}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:**  My initial offer is $85, which is still above Alice's value ($80). This shows I'm willing to negotiate but also trying to get a good price.
* **Reasoning:** I've offered a price that's lower than the initial offer, but still potentially profitable for Alice.  I've included a message to keep the negotiation friendly and open to compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that 85 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you the product for 88. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $88. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $88
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's compromise:**  Alice has lowered her price to $88, which is closer to my ideal price.
* **Value vs. Cost:** While I could continue negotiating, the potential savings are minimal. $88 is still within my budget and a good deal compared to John's $100.
* **Time constraint:** With only 10 rounds, it's not worth risking a deadlock. Accepting the offer ensures I get the product within my budget."
