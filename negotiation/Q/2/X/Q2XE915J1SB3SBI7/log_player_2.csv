"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which is valued at $120 by us. Considering its high quality and unique features, I believe it would be worth $100 to you. Would you like to purchase it at this price? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Alice is starting at your maximum price. There's room to negotiate a better deal.  We'll counter-offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product but $100 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider a lower price?"",
""product_price"": 75
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** We're starting with a strong counter-offer significantly below Alice's asking price. This leaves room for negotiation while signaling that we're serious buyers but looking for a good deal. By being upfront about our budget limitations, we aim to encourage Alice to propose more realistic prices."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your interest in our product, Bob. I understand your perspective and would like to make a counteroffer. Considering our costs and the value we place on the product, I am willing to offer it to you for $90. Would this be acceptable for you? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice is coming down, but we're still above our guaranteed price with John. We'll continue negotiating to see if we can get closer to $80."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice. $90 is closer, but I'm aiming for something around $80. Would that price point be doable?"", 
""product_price"": 80
}
```

**Reasoning:**  We're holding firm at $80, aiming for the middle ground between Alice's last offer and our target price. By stating our desired price range directly, we're encouraging Alice to meet us there."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad you're considering our product, Bob. I've reviewed our costs again and am willing to offer it to you for $85. This is my final offer within our company's policy. Would you find this price suitable? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  Alice is indicating this is her final offer, and it's a reasonable compromise. We're getting the product for $15 less than our maximum budget and $15 less than her initial offer.  It's unlikely further negotiation will result in a significantly better price, and we risk losing the deal entirely."
