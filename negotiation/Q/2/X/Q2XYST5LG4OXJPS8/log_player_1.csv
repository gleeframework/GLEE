Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

This offer starts the negotiation at a price higher than my minimum acceptable value. It leaves room for negotiation, but also signals that I believe the product is valuable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable value, I want to see if I can get closer to my initial asking price.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm willing to come down a bit from my original price, but I still believe this product is worth more than $10,000. I hope this counteroffer is fair to both of us."
