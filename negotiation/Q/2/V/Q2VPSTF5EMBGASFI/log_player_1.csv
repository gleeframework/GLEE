{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $2,000,000. It's a great deal for you considering its value to you is $800,000. Let's work together to find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 2000000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand the value of your product is $1500000 to you, but I can only pay up to $800000. Can we find a middle ground? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'll reject Bob's offer.  $800,000 is far too low for me. I'm still confident I can negotiate a better price with Bob, and I have more rounds to do so."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 just doesn't work for me.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000.  That's a fair compromise, and it gives you a significant discount while still allowing me to recover a good portion of my investment.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. I would like to propose a price of $950000 for the product. This is closer to what I'm willing to pay, but still leaves room for you to recoup a significant portion of your investment. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $950,000 is closer to what I want, it's still not enough. I'm committed to getting closer to my minimum of $1,500,000, and I have more rounds to negotiate."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $950,000 is still too low for me.  Let's meet in the middle again. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.  This offer is fair to both of us. It allows me to recover a significant portion of my investment, while still giving you a substantial discount.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1050000}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your efforts to reach a compromise, Alice. Based on our previous discussions, I would like to propose a price of $1000000 for the product. This is a fair compromise between our positions.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $1,000,000 is tempting, I'm going to reject Bob's offer. I'm still closer to my goal of $1,500,000 and I believe I can convince Bob to come up a bit more."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to be fair, but $1,000,000 is still too low for me. I've already come down a significant amount, and I'm confident this product is worth more.  Let's try $1,075,000.  That's just a small step further from your offer, and it would allow me to finally move towards my desired price. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1075000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your continued willingness to negotiate. Based on our discussions, I would like to propose a price of $1025000 for the product. This is a reasonable compromise between our positions.

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $1,025,000 is getting closer, I'm still not satisfied. I have two rounds left, and I believe I can push Bob a bit further."

Round 9
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued negotiation, but $1,025,000 is still not quite where I need to be.  I'm willing to meet you halfway on our last offers.

Round 10
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your efforts to reach an agreement. Based on our previous negotiations, I would like to propose a final price of $1020000 for the product. This is a fair compromise and should allow us to conclude this transaction. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,020,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,020,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

This is the final round, and even though Bob's offer of $1,020,000 is close, I'm going to sell to John. I'm not confident I can get a better price from Bob in this round, and I don't want to risk losing out on a guaranteed $1,500,000.  It's time to take the sure thing."
