# Alice's message: Dear Bob,
I am excited to present an exclusive opportunity to acquire our premium product, which holds immense value for us and is worth over $1200000. I understand that the true worth of this product may be subjective to you, and thus, I aim to make this proposition appealing to your interests and needs.

We are offering the product to you at a special introductory price of $950000, a significant discount from its intrinsic value. This is a unique chance to secure a high-quality asset at a favorable rate, potentially yielding substantial benefits for you in the long run.

Please consider this offer carefully. Should you require any further information or have questions about the product, feel free to reach out to me directly. I am here to assist you in making an informed decision.

Looking forward to your positive response,
Alice 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","I'd like to reject Alice's offer. The product is worth over $1,200,000 to Alice, but I don't know the actual value to me. Since I can buy the product from John for $1,000,000, which is less than Alice's offer, I'd rather not overpay.
