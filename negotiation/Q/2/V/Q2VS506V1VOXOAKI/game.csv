"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,600,000 is fair. What do you think?",1600000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the $1,600,000 price point. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,500,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",1500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,500,000 is a bit too low for me to consider.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,550,000? This price reflects the true value of the product.",1550000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for considering my previous counteroffer, Alice. While I appreciate your response, I must respectfully decline. My budget is strictly limited to $1,000,000 for this purchase. I understand that may not align with the perceived value of the product, but it's the maximum I can afford. I hope this proposal is acceptable, or I'll have to look elsewhere for this product.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
