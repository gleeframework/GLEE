Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1100000} 

This offer is significantly higher than Bob's valuation, but still leaves room for potential negotiation and a mutually beneficial agreement.  It also reflects my understanding of the product's worth to me, while leaving a comfortable margin to potentially reach a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $950,000 is closer to my desired price than Bob's initial valuation, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price.  I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob in hopes of reaching a more favorable agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000} 
```

This counteroffer is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer.  It demonstrates flexibility and willingness to negotiate while still ensuring I receive a price that is closer to my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, but it's still too low.  It's time to cut my losses and sell to John.  While I would have preferred to get a higher price, John's offer guarantees me my minimum and ensures I don't waste more time on a potentially unsuccessful negotiation with Bob."
