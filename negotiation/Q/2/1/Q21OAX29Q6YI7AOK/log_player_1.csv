Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 18000} 
```

I'm starting with a price of $18,000. This is a good starting point as it's higher than my minimum, but still leaves room for negotiation.  I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
I'll reject Bob's offer. While $15,000 is my minimum, I'd like to see if I can get a little closer to my initial asking price.  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 16500} 
```

I'm offering $16,500. This is a compromise between my initial asking price and Bob's offer. It shows that I'm willing to negotiate, but also that I'm not willing to settle for his initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,500.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'll accept Bob's offer of $15,500.  While it's not my ideal price, it's still above my minimum and closer to my initial asking price.  It's a good deal, and I'd rather not risk losing the sale completely by continuing to negotiate."
