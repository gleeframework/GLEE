Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because it:

* **Is higher than Bob's perceived value:**  Bob is willing to pay $12,000, so $14,000 gives him some room to negotiate.
* **Is lower than your ""fallback"" price:** You're guaranteed $15,000 from John, so you have room to compromise with Bob.

By offering a price in the middle, you increase the chances of Bob accepting the offer while still getting a good deal."
