Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its unique value, I'm initially proposing a price of $19,000. I believe this reflects its worth and potential. What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 19000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** By initially offering the product at $19,000, Alice anchors the negotiation at a point significantly above both her minimum price and Bob's perceived value.  
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  This high starting point allows room for potential counter-offers from Bob, while still ensuring Alice is in a strong position to negotiate down towards her minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Justification and Exclusivity:**  The message subtly emphasizes the product's value and presents the offer as an ""exclusive opportunity,"" potentially making Bob more inclined to consider it seriously.

**Important Note:** Alice knows she has John as a guaranteed backup buyer at $15,000. This knowledge gives her leverage to start the negotiation with Bob at a higher price."
