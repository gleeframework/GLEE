"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $14,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $10,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $12,500.  This price still reflects the product's value and leaves room for both of us to be satisfied. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",12500.0,Alice,3,

,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob,  I'm glad we're getting closer.  However, $11,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $11,750.  This price is fair, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us.  What do you say?",11750.0,Alice,5,
