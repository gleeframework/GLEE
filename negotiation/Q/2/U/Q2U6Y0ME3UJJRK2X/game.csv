,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $130 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $135.  This is still a great deal for you, considering the value you place on the product. What do you say?",135.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still a bit hesitant at $135. Can you meet me at $130 again? I'm willing to compromise, but I really want to get this product for a good price.",130.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you want a good price, but $130 is just too low for me. Let's split the difference - I'll accept $132.  That's a fair price for both of us. Let me know if you're interested.",132.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with $132. Can you meet me at $129? I'm willing to make a small concession, but I really want to get this product for the best price possible.",129.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a great price, but $129 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $130, but I can't go any lower. Let's wrap this up, I'm confident you'll agree this is a great deal.",130.0,Alice,7,
