,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm really interested in the product, but $200 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $150. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",150.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob, and I appreciate your interest. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price. How about $175?  This gives us both some room to compromise.",175.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $175 is still a bit too high for me. I'm thinking more along the lines of $140. I'm really interested in the product, and I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to stay within my budget.",140.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Okay, Bob, I hear you.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to sell it for $155.  That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.",155.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the offer, but $155 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer of $140, so how about $145? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",145.0,Bob,6,
