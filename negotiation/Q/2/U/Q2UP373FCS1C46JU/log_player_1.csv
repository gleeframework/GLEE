"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but $200 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $150. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?

Round 4
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $140.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but $155 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer of $140, so how about $145? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $145
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I was hoping to get closer to my initial asking price, $145 is still above my minimum, and it's likely that we're not going to agree on a higher price.  It's better to secure the sale now than to risk getting nothing."
