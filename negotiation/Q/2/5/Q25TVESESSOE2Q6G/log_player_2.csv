You can do better than $140.  Let's see if we can get a lower price from Alice."

Alice's offer:

It's worth it to accept Alice's offer. You're getting the product for $138, which is cheaper than John's price of $150 and still within your budget.  Even though we could keep negotiating, there's a chance Alice will walk away, and then you'd be stuck with John's price."
