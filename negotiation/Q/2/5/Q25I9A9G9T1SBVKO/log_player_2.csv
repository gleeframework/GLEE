"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You're aiming to save as much money as possible.  Alice's offer of $120 is still above your maximum budget of $150, and you can always get the product from John for $150. It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice to see if you can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer, and it's still within your budget. It shows Alice that you're serious about negotiating but also leaves room for some back-and-forth.  You're hoping to land a price closer to your target, but you're also prepared to walk away if necessary."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $118. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $118
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $118 is still a bit too high. You're trying to save as much money as possible, and there's still room for negotiation. It's worth trying to see if you can get a lower price before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has shown a willingness to compromise by lowering her price from $120 to $118.  This counteroffer of $110 is a small step closer to her last offer, signaling that you're willing to meet halfway.  You're hoping this will be enough to get a deal within your budget, but you're also prepared to walk away if necessary."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $117. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $117
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $117 is just within your budget of $150. While you might be able to continue negotiating, it's a risk. There's no guarantee you'll get a lower price, and you only have five rounds left before you have to buy from John.  Accepting this offer allows you to get the product at a reasonable price and still save some money compared to buying from John."
