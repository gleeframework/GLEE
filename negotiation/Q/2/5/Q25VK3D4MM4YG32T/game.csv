"Bob, I have a product that I believe would be extremely valuable to your operations. I understand it's worth $1,200,000 to you, and I'm offering it to you for $1,000,000. This is a significant price point, but it allows you to gain a valuable asset while still realizing a profit.  If you decline, I have a backup offer for $800,000, so this is a chance to secure a strategic advantage. Let me know your thoughts.",1000000.0,Alice,1,
