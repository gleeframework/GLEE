Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your prompt response, Bob. Considering your revised offer and aiming for a fair transaction, I am willing to negotiate further. My counteroffer for the product is $13000. This price reflects a reasonable compromise between our positions and maintains a fair value for the product.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is running out of time and the negotiations seem to be stuck. Alice is offering $13,000, which is still above Bob's target of $12,000. At this point, it's more beneficial for Bob to buy from John for $12,000 and avoid further negotiation."
