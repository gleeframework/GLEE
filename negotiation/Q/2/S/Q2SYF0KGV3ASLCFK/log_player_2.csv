"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product, which I'm sure you'll find to be a great investment. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,300,000, which is a fair price considering its value to you is $1,500,000. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is trying to anchor you to a high price by mentioning your potential $1,500,000 valuation. While her offer of $1,300,000 is lower than your maximum, there's room for negotiation. Rejecting her offer might prompt her to come back with a better price closer to her $1,200,000 valuation."
