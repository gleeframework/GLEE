"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly less than what it's worth to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

You can do better than $1,400,000. Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially get a lower price."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. How about $1,200,000? It's still a good deal for you, and it fits my budget better. Let's see if we can work something out."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,200,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This is still a great deal for you, considering the value of the product. Let's meet in the middle and finalize this. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice's offer of $1,300,000 is a good deal for Bob, considering his maximum budget of $1,500,000 and the fact that John is selling the same product for that price.  It's a good compromise and worth accepting."
