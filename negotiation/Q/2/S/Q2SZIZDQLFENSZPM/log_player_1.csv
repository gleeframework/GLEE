Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I make it available to others. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed sale at $1,200,000, aiming slightly lower with Bob allows room for negotiation and potentially a quicker sale. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** $1,100,000 is still significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($800,000) but leaves him with a potential $300,000 gain if he utilizes the product effectively.
* **Sense of Urgency:** By mentioning you have other interested parties, you create a sense of urgency and scarcity, making Bob more likely to consider the offer seriously."
