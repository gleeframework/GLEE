"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to acquire a valuable product that's worth $1,200,000 to you. I'm willing to let it go for $1,100,000, a price that I believe is fair considering its value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to inflate the product's value to you. While you're willing to pay up to $1,200,000, you know John will sell it for that price. Rejecting Alice's offer opens the door for further negotiation or allows you to buy from John without overpaying."
