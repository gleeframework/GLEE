"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $17,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 17000}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's estimated value to leave room for negotiation.  $17,000 is a good starting point as it's still within a reasonable range for Bob to consider, and allows me to potentially earn a good profit.  I'm also being friendly and positive to establish a good rapport."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of your product, but I am only able to pay up to $12,000 for it. I hope this revised offer is acceptable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. $12,000 is too low for me, and I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price.  I'm going to counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price.  How about $15,000?  This is still a great price for you, and it's a fair price for me.  Let's see if we can make this work!"", ""product_price"": 15000} 
``` 
 
I'm offering $15,000, which is still above Bob's value but more realistic. I'm also emphasizing the value proposition for Bob while reaffirming my position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your willingness to negotiate. I appreciate your product, but I am still unable to meet the price of $15,000. I would like to propose a price of $13,000. I hope this is within your range and allows us to reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm still going to reject Bob's offer. While $13,000 is closer to my desired price, it's still not high enough. I'm going to try to push for a higher price in the next round.  I'm not in a huge hurry and believe there's still room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $13,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $14,000?  This is a fair price for both of us. Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 14000} 
``` 

I'm offering $14,000, which is a compromise between my last offer and Bob's. I'm emphasizing that I'm willing to work with Bob, but I'm also holding firm on my position. I'm hoping that this offer will be acceptable to Bob and that we can finally reach an agreement."
