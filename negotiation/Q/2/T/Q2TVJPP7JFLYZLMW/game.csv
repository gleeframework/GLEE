"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of your product, but I am only able to pay up to $12,000 for it. I hope this revised offer is acceptable.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price.  How about $15,000?  This is still a great price for you, and it's a fair price for me.  Let's see if we can make this work!",15000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for your willingness to negotiate. I appreciate your product, but I am still unable to meet the price of $15,000. I would like to propose a price of $13,000. I hope this is within your range and allows us to reach an agreement.",13000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $13,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $14,000?  This is a fair price for both of us. Let's close this deal!",14000.0,Alice,5,
