Round 2

{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $1,400,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product. This is my best offer, and I believe it reflects the value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's try to reach an agreement that benefits both of us.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above my maximum budget. I'm going to reject this offer and try to negotiate further. There are still several rounds left, and I believe I can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $1,300,000 is still beyond my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,150,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. I believe this is a fair price considering the value of the product and my financial constraints. Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you coming up with a higher offer.  However, $1,150,000 still doesn't reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,250,000. This is a fair price considering the benefits this product will provide. Let's close this deal now. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above my maximum budget.  While it is tempting to close the deal with Alice now, I want to see if I can squeeze out a better price. I'm still hoping to secure the product for closer to $1,200,000 and with several rounds left, there's still room to negotiate."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $1,250,000, but I'm still slightly over budget.  I'm willing to offer $1,225,000.
