"Bob, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,300,000? It's a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm not sure I'm willing to meet you halfway, Alice. I'm still a bit too high on the price. How about we try $1,250,000? I think that's a more reasonable price, considering the value you place on the product is $1,200,000. Let me know if that's something you'd be willing to consider.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
