Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the value, $1400000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd be willing to pay $1250000. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,250,000 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I have 9 rounds left to try and get closer to my target price or sell to John."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $1,250,000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get at least $1,350,000 for the product. It's a fair price considering the value you'll get out of it. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1350000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $1350000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1300000.  This is a fair price considering the value for both of us. Let's see if we can close the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While it's not my ideal price, it's getting closer to my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I have limited rounds left and I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely."
