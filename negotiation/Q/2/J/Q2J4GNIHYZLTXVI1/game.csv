"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the value, $1400000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd be willing to pay $1250000. Let me know what you think.",1250000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $1250000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get at least $1350000 for the product. It's a fair price considering the value you'll get out of it. What do you say?",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1350000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1300000.  This is a fair price considering the value for both of us. Let's see if we can close the deal.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
