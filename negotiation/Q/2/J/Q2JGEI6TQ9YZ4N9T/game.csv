"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $13000. This is a competitive price considering its worth to you is $15000. I believe it's a fair starting point for our negotiation. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $12000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $13500. This is a compromise that still reflects the value I believe the product holds for you. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,3,
