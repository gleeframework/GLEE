Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $9,000 is still a bit lower than my target price, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $9,250. This is as low as I'm willing to go, so let me know if this is something you're interested in.

While $9,250 is closer to your target price, it's still above your maximum budget of $8,000.  Since John is offering the product for your desired price, it's a better decision to buy from John."
