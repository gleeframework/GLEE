"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $10,000. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $10,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand that $10,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $9,500. What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down in price, but $9,500 is still a bit more than I'm able to pay right now. I'm willing to go to $9,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can make this work.",9000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $9,000 is still a bit lower than my target price, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $9,250. This is as low as I'm willing to go, so let me know if this is something you're interested in.",9250.0,Alice,5,
