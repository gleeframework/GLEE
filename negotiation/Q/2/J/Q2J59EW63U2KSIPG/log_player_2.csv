"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is a good price, there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and secure a better deal.  It's important to remember that Bob has a fallback option with John, so there's no pressure to accept the first offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a lower counteroffer to gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate.  $10,000 is a significant discount from Alice's initial offer, demonstrating Bob's desire for a good price.  This will likely lead to further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $11,000 is a good compromise, considering Bob's initial counteroffer of $10,000.  It's a significant saving compared to buying from John, and it's likely that further negotiation might not yield much more of a discount. Accepting this offer ensures a successful purchase within Bob's budget and leaves room for potential future savings if the product proves to be worth more."
