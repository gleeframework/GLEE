Round 2
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $1,300,000 is a tempting offer, the value of this product is truly significant. I could consider coming down to $1,450,000. This offer reflects the true worth of what you're gaining."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000

``` 

While I could push for more, accepting Bob's offer of $1,250,000 makes the most sense at this point. Here's why:

* **Profitable:** It's still a significant profit above my minimum ($1,200,000).
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Continuing negotiations risks him lowering his offer or walking away, leaving me with John's lower offer. 
* **Time Value:**  A deal now is worth more than a potentially better deal later."
