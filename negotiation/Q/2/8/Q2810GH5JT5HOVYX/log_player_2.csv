"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

It's better to try to negotiate with Alice first. You can likely get a better price than $12,000, even if it takes a few rounds.  Buying from John is always an option, but it's best to exhaust negotiation with Alice first to see if you can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a low counteroffer of $9,000. This is significantly lower than Alice's offer of $12,000, but it's still within the range of what I'm willing to pay.  I'm aiming to start the negotiation process and see if Alice is willing to come down."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has moved closer to my desired price, but it's still above my target.  I will continue to negotiate and try to get a lower price before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer to $10,500. This is a significant increase from my previous offer, but it's still lower than Alice's offer of $11,000.  I'm showing that I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm also trying to keep the price as low as possible. I'm hoping that Alice will see the value in reaching a deal quickly and will accept this offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is closer to my target price, it's still above my maximum. I'm not willing to pay more than $10,500. Since I have more rounds to negotiate and the option to buy from John, I will continue to try and get a better price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm sticking with my previous counteroffer of $10,500. Alice has shown a willingness to negotiate, but I'm hoping that by holding firm on my price, she'll realize it's in her best interest to accept my offer and close the deal rather than risk me buying from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is higher than my maximum, and we've gone back and forth without much progress. I've made a counteroffer and stayed firm, but Alice hasn't moved.  Since we are halfway through the rounds and I have a reliable alternative in John, it's now in my best interest to buy the product from John for $10,000. This ensures I get the product while staying within my budget."
