"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique and valuable product that I think you'll really love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $120. Is this something you'd be interested in? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $120 is your maximum, it's always good to try and negotiate a lower price. There's no information about the product's value to Alice, so there's potential for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  Would you be willing to consider $100? "", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but not too low:** A $20 reduction is a significant offer, demonstrating you're serious but leaving room for negotiation.
* **Reasoning included:**  Explaining why you're counteroffering shows good faith and encourages Alice to engage. 
* **Sets a starting point:** This sets a clear price point for further negotiations."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob. However, I have to make a profit, and $100 is below my minimum. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so I'll offer it to you for $110. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** Alice's offer is a good compromise, splitting the difference between your previous offer and her original price.
* **Limited rounds:** With only 10 rounds, it's better to secure a deal close to your maximum than risk running out of time and having to pay John's full price.
* **Potential value:** Although you don't know the product's value to Alice, the fact she's willing to negotiate suggests it's not something she's desperate to sell at any price."
