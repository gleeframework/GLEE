"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm really interested in the product but $100 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $85 for it. What do you think?",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $85 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $95 to make this work. It's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. What do you think?",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, $95 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $90 for the product, which is a fair compromise. Let me know what you think.",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $90 is still a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $92.50? This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing me to make a profit while ensuring you get a great deal on the product.",92.5,Alice,5,
