Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident it will be worth every penny to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price slightly below my minimum acceptable price ($15,000) to leave room for negotiation.
* **Appealing to Value:** I'm emphasizing the product's value to Bob, hoping to encourage him to accept.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm making it clear that I'm open to negotiation, but I'm not giving away the farm just yet.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, great! I've secured a good price.
* If Bob rejects, I'll need to assess his counteroffer and decide whether to accept, counter, or move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11000. I believe that's a fair price considering the market value of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** $11,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000 and even below Bob's own perceived value of $12,000. 
* **Room for Negotiation:**  There's still room to negotiate a price closer to my desired amount. I'm willing to give Bob another chance, but I won't settle for such a low price.
* **Potential for a Better Deal:** By rejecting his offer, I keep the negotiation open and might be able to reach a more favorable price in subsequent rounds. 

**Next Steps:**

I will now send Bob a counteroffer to try to bridge the gap between our expectations."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your offer.  While $11,000 is below my expectations, I'm willing to compromise.  How about $13,000? This would still be a good deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my target price. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  I'm proposing a price that's halfway between my previous offer ($14,000) and Bob's offer ($11,000). This shows I'm willing to be flexible while still holding my ground.
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value and that this price is still a good deal for him. 
* **Focus on Compromise:** I'm framing the counteroffer as a compromise, implying a willingness to negotiate further if needed.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts my counteroffer, I've successfully negotiated a price closer to my desired amount. 
* If Bob rejects, I'll have to analyze his next counteroffer and determine whether to accept, counter again, or move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $13000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $12500. I think this is a fair price considering the market value of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Bob's Perceived Value:** Bob's offer of $12,500 is right at his perceived value of the product.  This means he's likely to be satisfied with this price.
* **Closing the Deal:**  While I would prefer to get closer to my $15,000 target, accepting this offer allows me to close the deal with Bob. This is a positive outcome, as it avoids further negotiation and ensures a sale.
* **Risk of Losing Bob:** If I continue to counter, I risk pushing Bob away and having to sell to John at a lower price than I initially hoped.

**Next Steps:**

I will accept Bob's offer and finalize the transaction. This is a win-win scenario, as both of us are satisfied with the deal."
