"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to invest in this valuable item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $11,000. This is a competitive price considering its worth to you is $8,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for our negotiation. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $11,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only able to go up to $9,500 at this time.  Let me know if that's something you'd be willing to consider.",9500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to sell the product for $9,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $11,000 and $9,500, which would be $10,250. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you is $8,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",10250.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. However, $10,250 is still a bit too high for me. I'm confident I can get it for closer to my budget. I'm willing to offer $9,800.  This is a fair price considering the product's value to me and your desire to sell.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",9800.0,Bob,4,

I'm willing to make a small concession and offer it to you for $10,500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",10500.0,Alice,5,
