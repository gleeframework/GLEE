Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the potential of the product, $950,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to offer $700,000 for it. This reflects the value you've placed on it, and still leaves room for a mutually beneficial deal. I'm confident this is a fair starting point for negotiations.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
