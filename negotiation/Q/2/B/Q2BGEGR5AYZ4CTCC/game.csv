"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As a starting point, I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value to you is $1,500,000. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm looking for a serious buyer who can appreciate the value of this product.",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the potential of the product, $950,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to offer $700,000 for it. This reflects the value you've placed on it, and still leaves room for a mutually beneficial deal. I'm confident this is a fair starting point for negotiations.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. Considering the product's true value to you is $1,500,000, I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $825,000. This is a compromise that still reflects the value you'll gain from the product, while also recognizing your willingness to negotiate. I'm open to further discussions, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair price for my product.",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $825,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to offer $750,000. This is a fair price that acknowledges the value of the product while also considering the profit you'll make.  Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us.",750000.0,Bob,4,

,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer, but $850,000 is still a bit outside my budget.  I'm willing to offer $775,000. This reflects the value of the product, your willingness to negotiate, and my need to keep the price within a reasonable range.  I believe this is a fair offer that will allow us to reach an agreement.",775000.0,Bob,6,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $825,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to offer $790,000. This is a significant compromise from my last offer, and I believe it's a fair price that allows us both to walk away satisfied. If you're willing to meet me halfway, we can close this deal. However, if you're not, I'll have to consider other options.",790000.0,Bob,8,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $790,000 is still a bit below your target price. However, I'm willing to make one final concession.

"Alice, this is my final offer. I'm willing to pay $800,000 for the product.  This is a fair price that acknowledges the value of the product while still allowing you to make a significant profit.  If you're not willing to accept this, I'll have to purchase the product from John for a higher price.  I'm confident that we can reach an agreement, but the ball is now in your court.",800000.0,Bob,10,
