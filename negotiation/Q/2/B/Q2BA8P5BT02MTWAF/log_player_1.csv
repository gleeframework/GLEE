Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $175. It's a great deal, and I know you'll love it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

This offer is based on the following reasoning:

* **Starting high:** It's generally a good strategy to start with a price higher than what you expect to get. This gives you room to negotiate down.
* **Reasonable margin:**  $175 is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value, but it leaves room for negotiation and still allows you to earn a profit above your minimum threshold.
* **Positive message:**  The message is friendly and emphasizes the value of the product, making Bob more likely to consider your offer. 

By starting with this offer, you can assess Bob's interest and adjust your strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the product, but I am only able to pay up to $100 for it. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $100 is significantly below my minimum price of $150 and also lower than what I offered initially. Accepting this would result in a significant loss.
* **Negotiation opportunity:**  While Bob's offer is low, it signals his interest in the product.  Rejecting this offer allows me to make a counteroffer and potentially reach a price closer to my desired value.
* **Selling to John:** While John offers a guaranteed $150, the potential for a higher price through negotiation with Bob makes it worthwhile to continue the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $100 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $130.  This price still allows me to cover my costs and still gives you a good deal on this great product.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moderate counteroffer:** $130 is a compromise between Bob's offer and my minimum price. It shows a willingness to negotiate while still leaving me room for profit.
* **Highlighting value:** The message emphasizes the product's value and how the price still benefits Bob.
* **Staying firm:** While I'm making a counteroffer, I'm not giving in too quickly.  This helps me avoid being seen as desperate and maintains my leverage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I understand your costs, but I am still unable to go above $110 for this product. I hope this revised offer is within your acceptable range. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:** While Bob has increased his offer, it's still below my minimum price of $150.  Continuing to negotiate with Bob could result in further concessions on my end and a lower final price.
* **John's offer is guaranteed:** Selling to John guarantees me a price that meets my minimum requirement and eliminates the risk of further negotiation with Bob.
* **Time is valuable:**  Negotiating with Bob takes time and effort.  Selling to John allows me to move on to other opportunities and potentially secure a higher price for a different product. 

While it's tempting to continue negotiating with Bob, the certainty of John's offer outweighs the potential for a slightly higher price from Bob."
