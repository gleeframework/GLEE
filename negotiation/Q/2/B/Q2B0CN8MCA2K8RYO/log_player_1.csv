Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm offering the product to Bob for $10,000. This is a fair price, considering the product is worth $8,000 to him and $12,000 to me. I'm confident that Bob will see the value in this offer, but I'm also willing to negotiate if necessary. If he rejects, I'm prepared to counter or walk away and sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $9,000 is closer to my desired price than his initial offer, I believe I can still get closer to my desired price of $12,000. I'm going to counter-offer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

I'm offering the product to Bob for $9,500. This is a compromise from my previous offer and closer to his offer, demonstrating my willingness to negotiate.  I'm confident that Bob will find this a fair price and accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I'd prefer to get closer to my desired $12,000, I'm aware that Bob's counteroffer is now very close to what I was willing to accept. I'm confident that this is the best outcome we can achieve given our current negotiation stance and that holding out for a higher price might risk losing the deal altogether."
