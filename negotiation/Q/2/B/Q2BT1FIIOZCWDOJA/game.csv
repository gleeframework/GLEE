"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. That price is a little high for me right now. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay closer to $6,000 for it.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your interest. I understand your perspective on the price.  However, $6,000 significantly undervalues the product and its capabilities. To find a middle ground, I'd be willing to come down to $14,000.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  To be honest,  $14,000 is still pushing my budget. I could potentially do $7,000. How does that sound?",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm seeing we both value this product. I'm trying to be fair, so let's settle this. How about $12,000? That's a significant price reduction on my end and reflects the true value of what's being offered.",12000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  That said,  I need to be mindful of my budget. I could stretch to $7,500, but that's really the most I can do.  What do you think?",7500.0,Bob,6,
