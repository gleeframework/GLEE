Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product.  Given its incredible value, I'm proposing a starting price of $16,000.  I'm confident you'll be impressed with what it offers."", ""product_price"": 16000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. That price is a little high for me right now. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay closer to $6,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your interest. I understand your perspective on the price.  However, $6,000 significantly undervalues the product and its capabilities. To find a middle ground, I'd be willing to come down to $14,000."", ""product_price"": 14000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  To be honest,  $14,000 is still pushing my budget. I could potentially do $7,000. How does that sound?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I'm seeing we both value this product. I'm trying to be fair, so let's settle this. How about $12,000? That's a significant price reduction on my end and reflects the true value of what's being offered."", ""product_price"": 12000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  That said,  I need to be mindful of my budget. I could stretch to $7,500, but that's really the most I can do.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500

**Reasoning:** 

Bob has shown a consistent unwillingness to meet even close to my lowest acceptable price.  At this point, further negotiation is unlikely to result in a significantly better offer from him. Accepting John's offer of $12,000 ensures I get my minimum desired value and avoids the risk of Bob's lowball offers in the remaining rounds."
