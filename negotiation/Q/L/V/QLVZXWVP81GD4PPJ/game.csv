"Hi Bob, thanks for the offer.  I appreciate your interest.  While $20,000 is my ideal price, I could be persuaded to go as low as $18,000. This product is really top-of-the-line and will provide you with a lot of value.",18000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on price. However, $18,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $15,000, but that's my absolute limit.  What do you think?",15000.0,Bob,4,
