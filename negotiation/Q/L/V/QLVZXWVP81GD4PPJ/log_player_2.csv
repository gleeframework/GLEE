"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product.  I think it would be perfect for you. My opening price is $20,000. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $20,000 is way above my maximum budget of $10,000.  It's worth exploring negotiation to see if we can get closer to my price range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $20,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer, but it's still within the realm of possibility for me.  I'm trying to gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate and hopefully find a middle ground."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for the offer.  I appreciate your interest.  While $20,000 is my ideal price, I could be persuaded to go as low as $18,000. This product is really top-of-the-line and will provide you with a lot of value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down in price, $18,000 is still outside of my budget. I'm going to continue negotiating to see if we can get closer to a price I'm comfortable with."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on price. However, $18,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $15,000, but that's my absolute limit.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 15000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm pushing further with my counteroffer, but I'm still leaving some room for negotiation. I'm hoping Alice will see that I'm serious about buying and that this is a fair price considering her desired price point and my budget."
