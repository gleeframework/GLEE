"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $11,000. I think this is a great deal, considering its value to you is $12,000. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $11,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer of $9,000. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm still looking for a better deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10,500. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll find it's still a great value. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. How about we settle at $9,750?",9750.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I'm still not quite there with $9,750. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $10,200. I think this is a fair price, considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",10200.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, this is my final offer. I can do $9,900.  It's a fair price and I'm eager to get this deal done.",9900.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $9,900 is your final offer, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I've already compromised a lot, and I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,900 and my original offer of $11,000. I'll offer it to you for $10,450. This is my last offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",10450.0,Alice,7,
