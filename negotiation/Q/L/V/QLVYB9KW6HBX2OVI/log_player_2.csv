"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for a price that's significantly less than its worth to you, but still allows me to achieve my desired price point. I'm confident you'll see the value in this opportunity. Let's discuss further! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is better than buying from John:** Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is less than John's price of $1,500,000.
* **You still save money:**  You are willing to pay up to $1,500,000, so accepting Alice's offer saves you $300,000."
