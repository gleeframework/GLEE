"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $20000. What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $20000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $8000 for this product.  Let me know if that's something we can work with.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $20000 might be a stretch for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $14000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $14000, but that's still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $10000.  Let's split the difference and see if we can reach an agreement.",10000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $14000 is still a bit too high for you, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10000. I'm willing to compromise and offer it to you for $12500. This is the best I can do, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",12500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $12500 is still a bit outside my budget, but I'm willing to go up to $11000.  This is a significant increase from my last offer, and I believe it shows my commitment to reaching an agreement.",11000.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $11000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $12750. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",12750.0,Alice,7,
