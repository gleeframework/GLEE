"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it's worth a lot to you. I'm starting with a price of $12,000. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm using a friendly tone to build rapport and encourage Bob to engage.
* **Emphasis on Value:**  I'm highlighting the potential value of the product to Bob, hoping to pique his interest.

**Strategic Considerations:**

* **John's Offer:** I'm keeping John's $15,000 offer in mind as my fallback option, but I'm hoping to get closer to my $15,000 target by negotiating with Bob.
* **Rounds:** I have 10 rounds, so I have some room to be flexible and explore potential compromises."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for it. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value Gap:**  Bob's offer is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Potential for Higher Price:** I have 8 rounds left and there is still room to negotiate. 
* **John's Offer:** While John's offer is tempting, I believe I can get closer to that price through negotiation with Bob.

**Next Steps:**

I will counteroffer Bob in the next round. I'll try to find a middle ground between my desired price and his offer, while still leaving room for further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm aiming for a bit higher.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,750?  This gives us both some room to compromise and allows us to move forward."", ""product_price"": 10750}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Middle Ground:** I'm offering a price that is halfway between my previous offer ($12,000) and Bob's offer ($9,500). This shows a willingness to compromise and signals that I'm serious about making a deal.
* **Room for Negotiation:**  This offer still leaves room for further negotiations in the remaining rounds. 
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm maintaining a friendly and encouraging tone to keep the conversation constructive.

**Strategic Considerations:**

* **John's Offer:** I'm keeping John's offer in mind, but I believe I can get closer to my target price by continuing to negotiate with Bob. 
* **Time Remaining:** With 7 rounds remaining, I have time to explore potential compromises."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,800 for the product. Can you consider this offer?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value Gap:** Bob's offer is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. While it is closer than his previous offer, it's not yet a price I'm willing to accept.
* **Potential for Higher Price:** I have 6 rounds left and there is still room to negotiate. I believe I can reach a better price by continuing the negotiations with Bob.
* **John's Offer:** While John's offer is tempting, I am hoping to get closer to that price through negotiation with Bob. 

**Next Steps:**

I will counteroffer Bob in the next round. I'll aim to find a middle ground between my desired price and his offer, while still leaving room for further negotiation."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still a little ways from where I need to be.  Let's try $10,250.  This is a fair compromise and allows us to bridge the gap. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10250}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Compromise:** I'm offering a smaller concession this time, showing that I'm still committed to getting a good price.
* **Midpoint Approach:**  This offer is closer to my desired price while remaining within a reasonable distance from Bob's last offer.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using encouraging language to keep the negotiation moving forward.

**Strategic Considerations:**

* **Remaining Rounds:** With 5 rounds left, I'm trying to get closer to a deal while still leaving room for further negotiations.
* **John's Offer:** While John's offer is always a safety net, I'm trying to maximize my earnings through negotiation. 
* **Buyer's Perspective:** I'm assuming Bob is genuinely interested in the product and is willing to pay a bit more to secure it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,500 again, and I'm willing to throw in some additional value to sweeten the deal. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value Gap:**  Even with the added value, Bob's offer is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Potential for Higher Price:**  I have 4 rounds left, and there is still room to negotiate.  I believe I can reach a better price by continuing the negotiations with Bob.
* **John's Offer:** While John's offer is tempting, I am hoping to get closer to that price through negotiation with Bob. 

**Next Steps:**

I will counteroffer Bob in the next round. I'll aim to find a middle ground between my desired price and his offer, while still leaving room for further negotiation.  Since the offer seems to be stuck at $9,500, I will try to make a counter-offer that is closer to my desired price and see if I can close the deal with a small concession on my part."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you sweetening the deal.  While I'm still aiming for a bit higher,  I'm willing to come down to $10,000.  This shows I'm serious about making a deal, and I believe it's a fair compromise.  Let's close this out!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Concession:** I'm making a small concession by lowering my offer from $10,250 to $10,000, showing flexibility and a willingness to reach a deal.
* **Close to Target:** This price is closer to my target price and still leaves room for a slight counteroffer from Bob.
* **Urgency:** I'm adding a sense of urgency by saying ""Let's close this out!"" to encourage Bob to accept my offer.

**Strategic Considerations:**

* **Remaining Rounds:** With 3 rounds left, I need to make a move to potentially secure a deal.
* **John's Offer:**  I'm still hoping to get closer to John's offer, but I'm also aware that Bob might be my only option at this point.
* **Potential for Agreement:** This offer is a reasonable compromise, and I believe Bob might be willing to accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,200 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the value I'm getting. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is Running Out:** With only 2 rounds remaining, the negotiation isn't moving in a direction that is favorable to me.
* **Unrealistic Expectations:** Bob seems unwilling to budge beyond his budget, and I've already made significant concessions.
* **John's Offer:**  John's offer guarantees me a significantly better return than Bob's current offer.

**Conclusion:**

I've exhausted my negotiation options with Bob, and it's clear that I'm unlikely to reach my target price. It's time to secure the guaranteed sale with John and move on."
