"Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* You value the product at $150.
* Alice is offering it for $120, which is lower than your value.
* Buying from John would cost you $150.

Therefore, accepting Alice's offer is the best option as it saves you $30 compared to buying from John."
