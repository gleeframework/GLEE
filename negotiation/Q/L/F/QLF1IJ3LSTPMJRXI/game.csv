"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $900,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to offer $700,000 for the product, considering its value to you is $800,000. This would allow both of us to make a reasonable profit. What do you think?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to part with the product for $700,000. Considering its value to me is $800,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $825,000. This is a fair price, considering the value you place on it.

"Alice, I understand you're trying to maximize your profit, but $825,000 is still a bit steep.  I'm willing to go up to $750,000 for the product. This is a fair compromise considering your value of $800,000 and my willingness to pay. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",750000.0,Bob,4,
