"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $14,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to get a better deal than your initial offer. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",14000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you countering.  While I'm motivated to sell, $14,000 is too low for me to consider. Could you do $18,000? That's a significant price drop from my initial offer and reflects my willingness to make a deal.",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $18,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but this time I'd like to propose $16,500. I'm confident that's a fair price considering the value you mentioned earlier.",16500.0,Bob,4,
