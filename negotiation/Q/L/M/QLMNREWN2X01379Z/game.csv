"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm definitely interested in the product, but that price is a little steep for me. How about we bring it down to $600,000? I think that's a fair starting point for negotiations.",600000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking for a better price, Bob. However, I have to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm not losing out. How about we meet in the middle at $900,000?",900000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. However,  $900,000 is still a bit high for my budget.  How about $750,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",750000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're trying to get the best deal, Bob. However, I've already compromised a lot by meeting you halfway in the previous round. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to think about my own profit margins. How about we try $850,000?",850000.0,Alice,5,
