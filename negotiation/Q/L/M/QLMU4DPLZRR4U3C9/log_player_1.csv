Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand your product is valuable, but given my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price of $9,500 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $9,500 is close to my minimum, I want to see if I can get closer to my ideal price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
