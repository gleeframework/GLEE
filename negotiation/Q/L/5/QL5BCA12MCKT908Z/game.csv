"I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $750000. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget. Can you consider my counteroffer?",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $750000 is unfortunately too low for me. However, I'm willing to come down to $850000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. Let's make this deal happen.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for considering my previous offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price. However, I'm still a bit above my target budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $820000? I think that's a fair compromise considering the value I see in the product.",820000.0,Bob,4,
