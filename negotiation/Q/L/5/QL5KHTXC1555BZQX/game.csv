"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the purchase of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that will benefit your business. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1300000.",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your offer is a good starting point, but I'm looking to pay closer to $1200000.  Would you be willing to come down to $1250000?",1250000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're looking to get a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial price. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $1250000. I'm willing to come down to $1280000, but I think that's as low as I can go. What do you think?",1280000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still hoping to land closer to my initial price of $1200000. Would you consider $1225000? This would be a fair compromise for both of us.",1225000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're still trying to get as close to your initial price as possible, Bob. I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to go much lower than my previous offer. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1280000 and $1225000, which would be $1252500. This is the best I can do, and I hope it's a compromise we can both live with.",1252500.0,Alice,5,
