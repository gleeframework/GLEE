Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're looking to get a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial price. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $1250000. I'm willing to come down to $1280000, but I think that's as low as I can go. What do you think?

Alice is closer to your target price, but you can still try to get a better deal. Reject her offer and make another counteroffer."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're still trying to get as close to your initial price as possible, Bob. I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to go much lower than my previous offer. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1280000 and $1225000, which would be $1252500. This is the best I can do, and I hope it's a compromise we can both live with.

While Alice is getting closer to your target price, you're not making significant progress. You're now within $52,500 of your maximum budget, and further negotiation might not be worth the time and effort. It's more efficient to buy from John and avoid potentially lengthy back-and-forth with Alice."
