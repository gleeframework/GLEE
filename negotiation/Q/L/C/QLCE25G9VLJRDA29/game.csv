"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to save as much as possible. I'm willing to pay $8800 for the product. Can you consider this offer?",8800.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $8800 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9200. This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.  Let me know what you think.",9200.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I'm getting closer to your offer, but $8900 still doesn't quite work for me. How about we split the difference and settle at $9050? This way, we both make a little ground and can close this deal. Let me know what you think.",9050.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $8700 is still too far off from my minimum.  I'm willing to come down to $9000 as a final compromise.  This is a significant concession on my part, and it's the best I can do.  Let me know if you're ready to close this deal.",9000.0,Alice,7,
