,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your interest.  $7,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. How about $8,500? That's still a good price for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I'm still trying to find a price that works for both of us. $7,500 is getting closer, but I'm not quite there yet. I'm willing to come down to $8,250. This is my final offer before I have to consider other options. Let me know if you're interested.",8250.0,Alice,5,
