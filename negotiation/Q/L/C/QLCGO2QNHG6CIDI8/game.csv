"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  $10,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about $12,500?  I think that's a fair price considering the value of the product and my minimum requirement. ",12500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,250?",11250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However,  $11,250 is still below my minimum. How about we split the difference and settle on $11,625? That's a fair price for both of us and we can finalise the deal.",11625.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, you're really tough!  I'm willing to go up a little bit more to $11,400.  That's already a decent compromise from my initial offer.",11400.0,Bob,6,
