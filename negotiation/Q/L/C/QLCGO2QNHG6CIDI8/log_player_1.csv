{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering my product to you for $14,000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $14,000, which is $2,000 above my minimum. This gives me some room to negotiate while still ensuring I make a profit.  I'm also being friendly and open to negotiation, hoping to reach a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $10,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low for me.  I'm not willing to sell for less than $12,000. I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  $10,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about $12,500?  I think that's a fair price considering the value of the product and my minimum requirement. "", ""product_price"": 12500} 
``` 
I'm counteroffering with $12,500, which is halfway between my minimum and Bob's offer. I'm hoping this will get the negotiations moving in the right direction."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,250? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low.  I'm not willing to sell for less than $12,000.  I'll reject his offer and see if we can reach a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However,  $11,250 is still below my minimum. How about we split the difference and settle on $11,625? That's a fair price for both of us and we can finalise the deal."", ""product_price"": 11625} 
```

I'm offering $11,625, which is slightly closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum. I'm hoping this will be enough to convince him to accept, but I'm prepared to negotiate further if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you're really tough!  I'm willing to go up a little bit more to $11,400.  That's already a decent compromise from my initial offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,400. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,400
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low for me. While I'm willing to negotiate, it seems we are not going to agree on a price.  I'll sell to John for $12,000.  It's not my ideal price, but it's better than selling for less than my minimum.  I can always try to get a better price next time I sell a similar product."
