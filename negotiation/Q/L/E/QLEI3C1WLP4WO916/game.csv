"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its unique features and potential, I'm initially offering it for $1,200,000.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, your offer is quite a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Given my budget and the value I see in this product, I'm willing to offer $850,000. I believe this is a fair price for both of us, allowing you to make a profit while still staying within my budget.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm confident this product's value significantly exceeds that price point. Let's meet in the middle â€“ how about $1,050,000?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you believe the product's worth is higher, but my budget is firm. I'm willing to go up to $900,000, which is still a significant profit for you considering your asking price. If this doesn't work for you, I'll have to consider other options.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm seeing the value you place on this product, and I'm willing to be flexible.  However, $900,000 is still quite a gap from where I see its worth. To avoid further negotiation, I'd be willing to accept a final offer of $975,000.  This allows me to recoup a fair value, and you gain a valuable asset.",975000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to be flexible, but $975,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm prepared to go up to $925,000. This represents a significant compromise on my part, and I hope you'll consider it. If we can't reach an agreement, I'll have to explore other options.",925000.0,Bob,6,
