Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm asking for $100 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($80) to leave room for negotiation.
* **Friendly tone:** A friendly tone encourages Bob to engage and potentially make a counteroffer.
* **Open-ended question:** Asking ""What do you think?"" invites Bob to share his thoughts and potentially make a counteroffer, keeping the negotiation open."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $80 is my minimum acceptable price, there's still potential to earn more. I'll reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer to keep the negotiation going.  I'll try to find a middle ground between our current positions."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $80 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $90? It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a price halfway between my previous offer ($100) and Bob's offer ($80) to show I'm willing to negotiate.
* **Positive framing:** I use phrases like ""fair price"" and ""meet you halfway"" to emphasize a win-win scenario. 
* **Clear counteroffer:** I explicitly state my new counteroffer price ($90) for clarity."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above $80. How about $85? I'm willing to pay a bit more, but I'm trying to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** Bob's offer of $85 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $80.
* **Potential for further negotiation:** While I could try to counteroffer again, it's unlikely Bob will budge much further. There's a risk of losing the sale completely.
* **Time efficiency:** Accepting the offer now secures a sale close to my minimum price without prolonging the negotiation."
