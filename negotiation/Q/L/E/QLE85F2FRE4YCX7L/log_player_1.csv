Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product.  However, $900,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $700,000 for it, which is still a good deal for you considering your value.  Let's see if we can find common ground.
