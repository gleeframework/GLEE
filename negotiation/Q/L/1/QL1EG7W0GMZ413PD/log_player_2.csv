"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to present our flagship product, which has been meticulously designed and crafted to meet the highest standards of quality and performance. This exceptional item holds significant value to us, but we're eager to explore its potential worth in your hands. We're offering it to you at an exclusive price of $500000. We believe this offers a unique opportunity for both parties to benefit. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly lower than my maximum price, making it a very attractive starting point. It's unlikely Alice will accept a counteroffer close to my maximum, so I'll start by rejecting and making a counteroffer.  This allows me to gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate and potentially secure a better deal."

# Alice's message: Thank you for your interest in our product, Bob. After careful consideration of your offer, we've decided to counter with a proposition of $750000.

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $750,000 is still significantly lower than my maximum price of $1,200,000. There's still room for negotiation. I'll reject her offer and make another counteroffer, hoping to find a price point that we both agree on."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, thank you for your continued interest in our product. After careful consideration, we've decided to counter your offer with a price of $850000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $850,000 is getting closer to my ideal price range. While I could continue negotiating, the risk of going too high and reaching my maximum price point of $1,200,000 is increasing.  Accepting this offer is a good compromise, allowing me to save $350,000 compared to buying from John."
