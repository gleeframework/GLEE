"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product, and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm thinking around $110 would be a fair price. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Reason:  Bob wants to save as much money as possible.  $110 is still too high, so rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer is the best strategy in the first round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $110 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $95.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 95}
``` 

Reason: This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial price, but it's still above Alice's minimum. It shows Bob is serious about buying but wants a good deal.  It's also a reasonable starting point for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your position, Bob.  How about we meet in the middle at $102? That's a very competitive price for this kind of quality. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $102. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $102
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Reason:  While $102 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, Bob can still do better.  Rejecting the offer allows him to continue negotiating and potentially get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  I'm still not quite there.  How about $98?  That's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 98}
```

Reason:  Bob is showing he's willing to compromise while staying within his budget.  $98 is a reasonable offer that's close to Alice's latest price, showing he's taking her offer seriously."
