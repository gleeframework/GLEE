"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on this product. I think you'll find it very valuable. How about $95? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested in the product, but $95 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $70?"",
""product_price"": 70
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  Negotiation often benefits from starting with a lower offer than you're ultimately willing to pay. This gives you room to negotiate upwards while still potentially securing a very good deal.
* **Polite and Direct:** The message is polite to maintain a positive negotiation environment, but also direct about finding the initial price too high.
* **Target Price:** Aiming for $70 is a significant price difference from Alice's starting point, but it's still a profitable price for her ($10 above her value). This leaves room for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest, Bob.  While $70 is too low, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $85? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is moving towards a more agreeable price, but it's still above our target. We have room to negotiate further and see if we can get closer to $80 before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I'm glad we're getting closer, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $77?"",
""product_price"": 77
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** Suggesting a middle ground between $85 and $70 shows willingness to negotiate and find a mutually agreeable price. 
* **Strategic Positioning:** $77 puts us slightly below the midpoint, maintaining a slight advantage in the negotiation.
* **Staying Below John:** We still have room to go up to $80 if needed, keeping us below John's offer and ensuring potential savings."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You drive a hard bargain, Bob!  Let's split the difference - $81, and we have a deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $81. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $81
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Good Deal:** $81 is a very good price for the product. It's significantly lower than John's offer of $100 and only slightly above Alice's value of $80. 
* **Diminishing Returns:** Continuing to negotiate might only yield very small savings at this point and risks the possibility of Alice walking away from the deal. 
* **Time Value:**  Sometimes a good deal now is better than a slightly better deal later, especially when the difference is small."
