"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $10,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $14,000. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. $14,000 is still a little high for my budget.  Would you consider $11,000? That's a fair offer, considering its actual value.",11000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $11,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $13,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, so I hope you can meet me in the middle.",13000.0,Alice,5,
