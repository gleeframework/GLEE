"I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $800000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you think the product is valuable to you, but I'm still not convinced that $800000 is a fair price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my target. I'm counteroffering at $1000000. This is a compromise, and I believe it's a reasonable price considering the product's value. Let me know if you're willing to meet me in the middle.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I'm still not quite there yet. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target. I'm counteroffering at $1100000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident that it's a fair price considering the product's value. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'm afraid I'll have to consider other options.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
