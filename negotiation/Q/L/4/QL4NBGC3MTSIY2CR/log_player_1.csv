"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. This is a fair price considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation. This allows me to potentially earn more while leaving open the possibility of a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time and consideration, Alice. However, $1750000 is a bit above my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $1400000. Would you be willing to consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low, and while I could settle for $1,500,000 with John, I believe I can get a better price by continuing the negotiation. I'll try to meet him halfway in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $1,400,000 simply wouldn't be fair to me.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $1,575,000.  Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 1575000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but $1575000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about we try $1500000? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is at my minimum acceptable price, and while I could potentially squeeze out a bit more, it's unlikely I'll get a better offer.  There's a risk that if I reject his offer, I might not be able to reach a deal with him or John in the remaining rounds.  Accepting Bob's offer guarantees me the minimum I'm comfortable with."
