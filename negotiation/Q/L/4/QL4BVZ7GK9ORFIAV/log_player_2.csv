"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for sale. It's a unique item that I believe would greatly enhance your daily life. Given its exceptional quality and features, I think it's worth more than what others are asking, but I'm willing to consider your valuation. I'm offering the product to you for $95, which is above its intrinsic value of $80 and below the market rate. This is an opportunity for you to get a high-quality product at a fair price. Please let me know if this offer suits your budget. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's sales pitch is persuasive, you know you can get the product for $80 from John. Rejecting her offer opens the door for a counter-offer or allows you to proceed with buying from John at your target price."
