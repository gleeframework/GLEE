{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd be interested in. It's a [briefly describe the product, highlighting its key benefits].  I'm asking for $10,000 for it, which I think is a fair price considering its value.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price of $10,000, which is higher than my minimum acceptable price of $8,000. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Highlighting Value:**  I'm briefly mentioning the product's benefits to pique Bob's interest and justify the price.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  I'm ending with a positive and open-ended question to encourage Bob to respond and start the negotiation process.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Market Research:** Before making an offer, I would ideally have some knowledge about the market value of similar products to inform my pricing strategy. 
* **Bob's Financial Situation:**  I would try to gauge Bob's financial capacity to determine if he's likely to accept a higher offer.
* **Negotiation Skills:**  I'll need to be prepared to negotiate effectively if Bob makes a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I see the value in [briefly mention a specific benefit of the product], $10000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'd be happy to buy it for $8000.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $8,000 is my minimum acceptable price. Accepting his offer guarantees me the best possible outcome in this scenario.  While I could try to negotiate further, there's no guarantee that I would get a higher price, and I risk losing the sale entirely if Bob rejects my counteroffer."
