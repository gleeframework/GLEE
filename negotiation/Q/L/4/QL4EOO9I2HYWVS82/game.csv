,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product but $100 is a bit high for me right now. How about $90? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob! However, I'm a bit hesitant to go as low as $90. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $105. Let me know if that's something you'd be comfortable with.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position. How about we split the difference and go with $97.50?  I'm really hoping to make this happen and I'm confident this price works for both of us.",97.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $97.50. I'm willing to go a bit higher and meet you at $110. This is my final offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement.",110.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $110 is still a bit too high for me. I'm confident we can find a solution that works for both of us. How about $102.50? Let's close this deal.",102.5,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob! However, I'm not willing to go as low as $102.50. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $107.50. This is my final offer, so I hope we can make a deal.",107.5,Alice,7,
