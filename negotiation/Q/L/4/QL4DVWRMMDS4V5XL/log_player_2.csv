You're not getting the best deal yet, so let's try to counteroffer Alice."

Let's start by offering Alice a price closer to what you're willing to pay. This gives you a chance to negotiate further without going straight to John."

Alice is still above your target price of $80. It's worth continuing to negotiate to see if we can get closer to your goal."

Let's try a slightly higher counteroffer, but still within your budget.  This shows Alice you're serious about buying but aren't willing to pay her full asking price."

Alice's price is now higher than her previous offer. It's clear that she's not willing to come down to your price.  Since you can get the product from John for $80, it's the best option at this point."
