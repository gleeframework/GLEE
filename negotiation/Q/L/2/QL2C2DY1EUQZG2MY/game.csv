"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit too expensive. I'm willing to pay $11500 for it. Can you consider this price?",11500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer, but unfortunately, $11500 is a bit too low for me. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $12250? It's still a good deal for you, as it's well below the value you placed on the product.",12250.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I'm still a bit hesitant to pay $12250. I'm willing to meet you halfway again. How about $11750? It's still a good deal for you, and I'm willing to compromise to reach an agreement.",11750.0,Bob,4,
