"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000.  It's a great deal for you, as you know it's worth $15,000 to you. Let's make this happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob can get a better deal. While $12,000 is a good price, it's still above the product's worth to Alice ($8,000). Bob can likely negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, $12,000 is a good start, but I'm hoping for a bit more of a discount. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob,  I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is just a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little more,  how about $11,000? That's still a great deal for you, and it gives us both a good margin. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

$11,000 is still a good deal for Bob. It's significantly lower than the price he would pay for the product from John, and it's a fair price considering Alice's bottom line is likely $8,000. Continuing to negotiate might get a lower price, but it risks the deal falling through and Bob having to pay $15,000 for the product from John."
