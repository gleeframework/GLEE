"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of a price more around $9,000. Would you be willing to consider this price?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While I understand you're aiming for a lower price, $9,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $11,000, but that's my absolute bottom line.  Let me know if you're interested in moving forward with that price.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your counteroffer. I'm still a bit above my budget, so I'm willing to go up to $10,500. Would you be willing to meet me halfway?",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $10,500 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway on *our* last offers, which would be $10,750.  This is my final offer, and it represents a significant discount from my initial price. Let me know if you're interested in finalizing the deal.",10750.0,Alice,5,
