"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think your initial price is a bit too high. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it. Can you consider this offer?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $900,000 is a good starting point, I need to recoup my investment and cover my costs. How about we meet in the middle at $1,050,000? This price is still a great value for you considering the product's worth, and it's a fair compromise.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, we're getting closer.  $950,000 is a good offer, but I still need to get a bit closer to my target price. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and I'm confident it will be a great investment for you.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
