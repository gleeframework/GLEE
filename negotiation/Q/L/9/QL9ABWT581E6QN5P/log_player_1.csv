{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for both of us, considering its value to you.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer allows for a decent profit for you (at $1,200,000) while still being significantly lower than your minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000). It also leaves room for negotiation if Bob wants to counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me. How about we meet somewhere in the middle, say around $650,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

$650,000 is far below my minimum acceptable price. It's worth trying to negotiate with Bob further before selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget. While $650,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price, I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This reflects the value the product brings to you while also allowing me to recoup a portion of my investment.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $900,000 is still a little steep for me.  Would you consider $725,000? I feel that's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $725,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $725,000 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still not enough. At this point, it's more beneficial to sell the product to John for $1,500,000, which is a much more favorable outcome."
