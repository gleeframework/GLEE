Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget. While $650,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price, I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This reflects the value the product brings to you while also allowing me to recoup a portion of my investment.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.
