"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $17,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $14,000 for it. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $14,000 is better than nothing, I'm confident I can get a better price. I'll try to counter-offer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $14,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $15,500?  It's a fair price considering the value of the product, and it gives us both a good deal. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 15500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $15,500 is still a bit more than I'm willing to pay. Let's meet in the middle at $15,250.  I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer of $15,250 is close enough to my minimum price of $15,000 that I'm willing to accept it. I'm confident that I won't be able to get a significantly better offer from Bob in the next round, and selling to John would only net me $15,000."
