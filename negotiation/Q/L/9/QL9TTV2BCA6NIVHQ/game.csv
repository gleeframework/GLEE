"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to let it go for $130. What do you think?",130.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I really appreciate it.  However, $130 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now.  Would you be open to $125?  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",125.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand where you're coming from, but I'm not willing to go down to $125 just yet. How about we meet in the middle at $135? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a decent profit on this product.",135.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $135 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $130?  That would be a fair deal for both of us, and I'd be happy to finalize the purchase then.",130.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand where you're coming from, Bob, but I'm not willing to give up on the extra $5 just yet. How about we meet at $132.50? It's still a good compromise, and I think it's a fair price for both of us.",132.5,Alice,5,
