"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. While I'm very interested, $1200000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Would you be willing to consider $1000000? I'm confident this price is fair for both of us, and would allow us to move forward with the sale.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
