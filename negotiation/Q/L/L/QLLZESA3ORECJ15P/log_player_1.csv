"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I think it would be incredibly beneficial for you. I'm asking for $20,000, which reflects the true value of what it offers."", ""product_price"": 20000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is significantly higher than what I'm able to pay.  I'm interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $10,000 at this time.  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","Bob's offer is closer to his value than mine, and I have plenty of rounds left to negotiate.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $20,000 is my ideal price, I understand we may need to find a middle ground. How about $17,000? I'm confident this product will exceed your expectations and be a worthwhile investment."", ""product_price"": 17000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $17,000 is still outside of my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $12,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. Let's see if we can find a compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","Bob is clearly willing to move closer to my price, and I still have a cushion before hitting John's offer.  I'll counter again.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $14,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $13,000, which represents a significant compromise on my part. Let's see if we can make this work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","This is a tough call. Bob is clearly getting closer to my minimum, but he's also moving slowly. I need to assess if he's likely to reach my minimum in the remaining rounds. 

Here's my thinking:

* **Accepting:** $13,000 is a decent profit, and it guarantees the sale. There's less risk in taking this sure thing.
* **Rejecting & Countering:** I risk Bob walking away, or our negotiations failing to reach $15,000. However, there's a chance he'll go higher, especially if I convey a sense of urgency.
* **Selling to John:** This is my safety net, guaranteeing $15,000. However, there's a chance Bob would have gone higher in subsequent rounds.

Given Bob's slow but steady increases, I'm going to risk it for one more round:

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $14,500 is my absolute bottom line.  This is a take-it-or-leave-it offer - I have another buyer ready at a higher price, but I believe in being fair with you.
