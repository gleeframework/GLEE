"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand that $700,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can do $850,000, which is a significant discount from my initial offer. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,,

"Hi Bob, I like the spirit of compromise, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $775,000. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I think $825,000 is a more reasonable price for this product. It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it's worth it. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,5,,
