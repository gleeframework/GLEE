"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product. I believe you'll find it to be a valuable addition to your collection. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's.**  You value the product at $1,500,000, and Alice is offering it for $1,200,000. This means you'll save $300,000 compared to buying from John.
* **You still get a good deal.** Even though Alice is selling it for $1,000,000, you're still able to get it for $1,200,000, which is below your maximum value. 

Therefore, accepting Alice's offer is the best financial decision."
