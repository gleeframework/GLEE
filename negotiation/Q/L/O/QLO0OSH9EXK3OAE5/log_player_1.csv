Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on this product. I think it would be perfect for you. I'm willing to part with it for $11,500.  What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to $12,000 as possible. 
* **Bob's Valuation:**  She knows Bob values it at $10,000, so she needs to leave room for negotiation but start above that value.
* **Alternative Buyer:** Alice has John as a backup, guaranteeing her $12,000. This gives her leverage to aim higher with Bob.

**The Strategy:**

This offer starts high but leaves room for Bob to negotiate down.  If Bob counter-offers, Alice can slightly reduce the price and still make a significant profit over John's offer."
