"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1500000} 

I'm starting high, aiming for a good profit. I want to see if Bob is seriously interested and how high he's willing to go.  If he rejects, I'll adjust my offer based on his counteroffer and my assessment of his willingness to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $800,000 is a significant amount, it's still below my minimum threshold of $1,000,000. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer in the next round. I believe I can get a better price, and I'm willing to continue negotiating to maximize my profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,200,000. This is a significant drop from my initial offer, but it's still within my acceptable range.  It shows I'm willing to compromise, but I'm also making it clear that I won't settle for anything significantly lower than my minimum goal."

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $900,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not comfortable selling for that price. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and counter again. With five rounds left, I have time to try to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

I'm going to drop my price again to $1,100,000. This is a compromise, but it's still above my minimum goal.  I'm hoping that Bob will see that I'm serious about selling the product and will meet me halfway."

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While $950,000 is tempting, I'm still not satisfied with the price. I'm going to try one more time to get closer to my minimum goal. With four rounds left, I'm confident I can get a better deal."

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,000,000.  We are running out of rounds and Bob's offer is still below my minimum target. I'm confident that John is a reliable buyer and will make the transaction smooth. It's better to guarantee a good price than to risk getting less by continuing to negotiate with Bob."
