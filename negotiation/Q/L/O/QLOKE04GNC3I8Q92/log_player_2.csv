Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective but I'm still firm on the value of this product.  $700000 doesn't reflect its potential. How about we meet in the middle at $850000? This allows for a fair price for both of us.

{""message"": ""I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still not comfortable with $850,000. I'm willing to go up to $750,000, but that's my final offer. I'm starting to think about other options, so I'd like to hear if you can meet me at this price."", ""product_price"": 750000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $750000 is still below my minimum value. However, I'm willing to come down to $825000 to make this deal work.  This is a significant compromise from my initial offer.  Let's find a solution that benefits both of us.

{""message"": ""I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with $825,000. I'm willing to meet you at $795,000, which is the lowest I'm willing to go. I hope we can make a deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 795000}"
