Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $700000. I believe that's a more reasonable price for the product, considering its potential and value.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective but I'm still firm on the value of this product.  $700,000 doesn't reflect its potential. How about we meet in the middle at $850,000? This allows for a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 850000}

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $750,000 is still below my minimum value. However, I'm willing to come down to $825,000 to make this deal work.
