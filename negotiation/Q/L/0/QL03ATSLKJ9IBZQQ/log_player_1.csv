Explanation: Bob is consistently making offers far below my minimum acceptable price. His latest offer of $16,250 is getting dangerously close to John's guaranteed offer of $15,000. It's clear Bob is unlikely to significantly increase his offer. It's time to cut my losses and secure the guaranteed sale with John."
