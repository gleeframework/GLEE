"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but the product is worth a lot to me, and $7,500 is too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,000?",9000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still interested in the product, but $9,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $7,250?",7250.0,Bob,4,
