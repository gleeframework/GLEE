"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm really interested in the product, but $11000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'd be happy to pay $10500.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'll reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a better price. I'll try to counter with a price closer to my desired value in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,500 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little more, how about $10,750?  This would allow me to get a bit closer to my desired price, while still giving you a good deal."", ""product_price"": 10750}
