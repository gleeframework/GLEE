"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm really interested in the product, but $11000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'd be happy to pay $10500.  What do you think?",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10500 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little more, how about $10750?  This would allow me to get a bit closer to my desired price, while still giving you a good deal.",10750.0,Alice,3,
