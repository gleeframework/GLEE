"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. I'm willing to make a deal, but I need to stay within my budget.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $90 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, how about $100?  That's still a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll be happy with the product.",100.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $100 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, how about $95? I'm confident we can make a deal at this price.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $95 is still a bit too low.  Let's split the difference. How about $97.50? This would ensure you get a great deal while still allowing me to make a fair profit.",97.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $97.50 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you at $92.50. This is the highest price I'm willing to pay, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price.",92.5,Bob,6,
