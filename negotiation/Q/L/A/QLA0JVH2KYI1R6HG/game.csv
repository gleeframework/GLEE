"Thank you for the offer, Alice. It's a great starting point. I'm very interested in the product, but $800,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this stage. I'm willing to pay $600,000 for it.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.",600000.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. I'm still very interested in this product, but $750,000 is still a bit out of my budget.  I'm ready to pay $700,000.
