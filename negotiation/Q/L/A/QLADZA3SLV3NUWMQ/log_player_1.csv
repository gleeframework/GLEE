Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product that I think you'd be very interested in. I'm offering it to you for $10,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you won't regret it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price of $10,000, which is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $8,000. This gives me room to negotiate down if needed.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using positive language to encourage Bob to consider the offer. 
* **Confidence:**  Expressing confidence in the product's value helps to establish its worth. 
* **Open to Negotiation:**  My message makes it clear that I'm willing to negotiate, which could be important if Bob has a lower budget. 

**Next Steps:**

* I'll analyze Bob's response. If he accepts, great! 
* If he rejects, I'll carefully consider his counteroffer and adjust my strategy accordingly. 
* If the negotiations stall or become unproductive, I'll move on to selling to John for my minimum price of $8,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product, $10000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. Would you be willing to go down to $8000? I'm confident we can reach a deal that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Counteroffer:**  Bob is offering the minimum price I'm willing to accept. 
* **Time and Risk:**  There's no guarantee that negotiating further will lead to a better outcome. Continuing negotiations could waste time and risk losing the sale altogether.
* **John's Offer:**  While John is willing to pay $8,000, there's no guarantee that I can find a buyer willing to pay more in the future.

**Conclusion:**  By accepting Bob's offer, I'm securing a sale at my minimum acceptable price, avoiding further negotiation, and minimizing risk."
