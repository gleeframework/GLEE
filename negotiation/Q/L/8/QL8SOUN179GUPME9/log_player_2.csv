Round 2

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your offer.  I appreciate your interest.  $6,000 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $7,500. This still gives you a good deal, and it's closer to what I need.  Let's see if we can make this work.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $6,750 is still a bit low for me.  Let's try $7,000. It's a fair compromise that gets us closer to a deal.  I'm confident that we can find a solution that works for both of us.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm happy to keep negotiating, but I'm not willing to go lower than $7,250. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product.  I'm confident that we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,250

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is stubbornly hovering above $7,000.  While we could continue negotiating, it's unlikely she'll come down significantly in the remaining rounds.  John's offer of $8,000 is now a better deal to ensure we get the product and avoid the risk of Alice not budging further."
