"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

There's no benefit to negotiating with Alice.  You've stated your maximum price is $1,500,000, and Alice is offering the product at that exact price.  John is also selling the product for the same price, so it makes no sense to engage in negotiations that could potentially lead to a higher price."
