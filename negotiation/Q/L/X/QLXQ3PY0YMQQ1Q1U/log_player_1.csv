"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $2,000,000. This is a bold move, but I believe it sets a strong starting point for negotiation.  I'm hoping Bob will see the value in the product and be willing to pay a premium.  We'll see how he responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  $1,000,000 is far too low for me. I know the product is worth at least $1,500,000 to me, and I'm hoping to get closer to that amount. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $1,750,000. This is a significant drop from my initial offer, but it still reflects the value I place on the product. I'm hoping this will be a more agreeable price for Bob, while still allowing me to make a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer again.  $1,250,000 is still too low for me.  I'm not willing to sell below my minimum threshold of $1,500,000 just yet.  I'll make another counteroffer in the next round.  I'm getting closer to John's offer, and I'm hoping that Bob will come up to meet me somewhere in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

I'm lowering my price again to $1,600,000. This is a significant concession, but I believe it's a fair compromise. I'm hoping Bob will recognize the value of the product and accept my offer.  I'm getting closer to John's offer, and I want to see if we can come to an agreement before I have to consider selling to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  $1,350,000 is still below my minimum threshold of $1,500,000, and I'm hoping to get closer to that amount. I'm also running out of time, so I'm going to make one more counteroffer before I consider selling to John.  Hopefully, Bob will come up a bit higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1550000}
```

I'm going to make one final counteroffer at $1,550,000. This is very close to my minimum price, and I'm hoping that Bob will see the value in the product and accept. If he doesn't, I'll have to consider selling to John for $1,500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,500,000.  I've made a number of concessions, and I don't think Bob is going to come up to my minimum price.  John is a sure thing, and I need to make sure I don't lose out on a sale completely."
