"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $9500 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $8000 for it, which is fair market value.  Let me know if you're open to that.",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $8000 is your maximum budget, but I was hoping to get a bit more for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $9000. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's still a fair price for this high-quality item.",9000.0,Alice,3,
