Bob should reject Alice's offer.  He's willing to pay up to $8,000, and Alice is asking for more. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $8000 is your maximum budget, but I was hoping to get a bit more for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $9000. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's still a fair price for this high-quality item. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000.

Bob is only willing to spend $8,000.  Alice's counteroffer is still too high.  John is offering the product for Bob's maximum budget, so it's best to buy from John."
