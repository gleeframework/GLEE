**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still above your maximum budget of $10,000.** While it's a slight discount, it's not enough to make it worthwhile for you.
* **You have a guaranteed alternative with John at $10,000.** This means you can reject Alice's offer and still get the product within your budget.
