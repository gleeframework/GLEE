"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $10,500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,000, which is a fair price considering the value of this product. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $9,800 is simply not going to work for me. How about we split the difference and go with $10,400?  It's a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away happy.",10400.0,Alice,5,
