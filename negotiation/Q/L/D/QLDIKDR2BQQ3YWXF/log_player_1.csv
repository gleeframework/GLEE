Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $9,800 is simply not going to work for me. How about we split the difference and go with $10,400?  It's a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 10400}

This is a tough one, but I'm going to sell to John.  We're down to the wire, and while $9,900 isn't horrible, it's still below my minimum of $12,000.  I'm willing to take the guaranteed $12,000 from John and move on."
