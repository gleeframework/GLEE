"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I believe a starting price of $1,100,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Aiming high initially leaves room for negotiation and signals the product's value.
* **Strategic Positioning:**  The offer is closer to Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000), increasing the chances of him engaging while still leaving room for Alice to negotiate down to a favorable price.
* **Justification:** Providing a reason for the price (""given its potential value"") makes the offer seem more reasonable and less arbitrary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit high for me. I'm thinking closer to $900,000 would be a more reasonable starting point. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is a good profit, it's still significantly below Bob's perceived value and leaves a substantial amount of potential money on the table. Bob's offer indicates he's willing to negotiate within a reasonable range. Alice should counter-offer, aiming to close the gap and secure a price closer to $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm confident this product can bring you even greater returns. How about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000? This reflects its true worth and potential."",
""product_price"": 1000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** This classic negotiation tactic often feels fair to both parties and encourages agreement.
* **Highlighting Value:**  Reiterating the product's potential benefits to Bob justifies the higher price. 
* **Firm but Fair:** The tone remains collaborative while demonstrating Alice's willingness to negotiate towards a mutually beneficial outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the value of this product, but I have a budget I need to stick to. Would you consider $950,000?  I think that's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Profit Margin:** $950,000 represents a $150,000 profit for Alice, which is a significant return. 
* **Bob's Budget Constraint:** Bob has mentioned a budget, signaling that this might be his upper limit. Pushing further could risk losing the deal.
* **Time Value of Money:**  Closing the deal now avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation rounds and secures the profit. 
* **Minimal Risk:** Accepting guarantees a substantial profit, whereas continuing negotiations carries the risk of Bob lowering his offer or Alice being forced to accept a lower price later."
