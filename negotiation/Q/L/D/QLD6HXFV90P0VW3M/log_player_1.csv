Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really love it! I'm offering it to you for $100.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's higher than your minimum:**  $100 is well above your minimum of $80, giving you some room to negotiate.
* **It's not too aggressive:** Starting too high could scare Bob off right away.
* **It's friendly:**  Starting with a friendly message can help build rapport.

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $80 is your minimum, there's still some room for negotiation. Rejecting Bob's offer allows you to counter with a price closer to your initial offer, potentially securing a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate your interest, Bob!  $80 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down a little. How about $90? It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 90} 
```

This counteroffer:

* **Acknowledges Bob's offer:**  Shows you're listening and willing to compromise.
* **Offers a reasonable compromise:**  $90 is a middle ground between your initial offer and Bob's offer.
* **Remains above your minimum:** You're still earning more than your minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice! However, I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $85? That's the lowest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While $85 is slightly less than your initial goal, it's still a good deal.  You're making more than your minimum ($80) and Bob seems firm on his price. There's a risk that further negotiation could lead to a lower price or a stalemate, while John is guaranteed to buy for $80.  It's a calculated risk to accept and secure a sale at a reasonable price."
