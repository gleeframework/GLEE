"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great fit for your needs. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still looking to get a good price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. I'm offering the product to you for $1,050,000. This is a fair compromise that takes into account your budget and the product's value to you.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you working with me on the price, Alice.  While $1,050,000 is closer, I'm aiming to stay under a million. Would you consider $925,000?",925000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your desire to stay under a million, Bob. However, I've already compromised significantly from my initial offer. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum acceptable price. I'm offering the product to you for $1,075,000. This is a final offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower.",1075000.0,Alice,5,
