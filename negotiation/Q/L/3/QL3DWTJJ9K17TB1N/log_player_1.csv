Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm asking for $2,000,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the significant return on investment you'll experience.  What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 2000000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, you can afford to start negotiations high. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob counters.
* **Justification:** By mentioning the product's ""value and potential,"" you reinforce its worth and set the expectation of a higher price.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The phrase ""What are your thoughts?"" invites Bob to engage in the negotiation process and potentially make a counteroffer. 

This strategy aims to maximize your potential profit while acknowledging that Bob might try to negotiate a lower price."
