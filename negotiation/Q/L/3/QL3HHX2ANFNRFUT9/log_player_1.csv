"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a great deal, and I believe it's worth more than $1,000,000 to you.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting at $1,100,000, leaving some room for negotiation but also ensuring I'm getting closer to my minimum of $1,200,000. 
* **Highlighting value:**  I emphasize that the product is worth more than $1,000,000 to Bob, subtly reminding him of the potential benefits he'll gain.
* **Open to negotiation:** I'm open to Bob's thoughts, setting the stage for a potential counteroffer and further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I believe that's a fair price for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $900,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. While I'm open to negotiation, I'm not willing to accept such a large drop in price this early in the process. 

I will counteroffer in the next round, aiming to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $900,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000, which is still a fair price considering the product's value. Let's try to find a middle ground here."", ""product_price"": 1050000} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-argument:** I acknowledge Bob's desire for a good deal but firmly state that his offer is too low.
* **Compromise:** I offer a counteroffer of $1,050,000, which is a substantial reduction from my initial offer but still well above Bob's offer. 
* **Finding a middle ground:** I frame the counteroffer as an attempt to find a middle ground, encouraging further negotiation and potentially leading to a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1050000, but I'm still not sure that's the best price for me. I'm thinking more along the lines of $950000. Can we meet in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $950,000 is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  While I want to close the deal, I'm not willing to accept such a low price at this point.

I will counteroffer in the next round, aiming for a higher price that is closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still not at a price that works for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000, which is a fair price considering the product's value and your interest. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Staying firm:** I acknowledge Bob's offer but reiterate that it's not acceptable. 
* **Final offer (for now):** I present $1,000,000 as a final offer, aiming to get close to my minimum acceptable price.
* **Closing the deal:**  I emphasize that I'm ready to close the deal at this price, hoping to pressure Bob into accepting."
