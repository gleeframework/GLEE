"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this incredible product from me. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but your asking price is a little high for me.  Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $950,000 might be a bit steep for you. However, I'm still looking to get a good price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $825,000. This is a significant discount from my original offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While $825,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still a bit hesitant at that price. Would you be willing to come down a bit more, say to $750,000? I think that would be a fair compromise.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make one more concession. However, I'm not willing to go below $800,000. That's the minimum I'm willing to accept for this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $750,000 and $800,000, so I'm offering it to you for $775,000. This is the best I can do, and I hope you'll consider it.",775000.0,Alice,5,
