"I understand you're looking for a better price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $12,000, but I'm not budging below that.",12000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me a bit in the middle.  While $12,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $9,000.  Would you be willing to consider that?",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm still not willing to go as low as $9,000, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you a price of $11,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price for this amazing product.",11000.0,Alice,5,
