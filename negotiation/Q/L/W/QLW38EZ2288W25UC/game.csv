"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is above my budget. I'm really interested in this product, but I can only offer $8,500 at this time. This is my best offer, let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate you countering.  While I'm motivated to find a good home for the product, $8,500 is too low for me to consider.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $10,250?",10250.0,Alice,3,
