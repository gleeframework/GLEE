Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at a price of $12,000. I believe it offers significant value and would be a great investment for you."",
""product_price"": 12000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with an offer higher than your minimum acceptable price ($10,000). This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a better deal.
* **Justification:**  By mentioning ""significant value"" and ""great investment,""  you are framing the product in a positive light and subtly justifying the higher price. 
* **Limited Time Offer:** Creating a sense of urgency (even if artificial) can encourage Bob to consider the offer more seriously.

This is just the opening move. How you proceed will depend on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is above my budget. I'm really interested in this product, but I can only offer $8,500 at this time. This is my best offer, let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is closer to his perceived value, it's still significantly below your minimum. You have room to negotiate further. John's offer provides a safety net, but it's worth trying to get closer to your desired price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate you countering.  While I'm motivated to find a good home for the product, $8,500 is too low for me to consider.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $10,250?"", 
""product_price"": 10250
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledgement:**  You acknowledge Bob's counteroffer, showing that you're engaging in the negotiation.
* **Firm but Fair:**  You reiterate that his initial offer is too low but phrase it politely (""too low for me to consider"").
* **Compromise:** By suggesting a price exactly halfway between your initial offer and his, you demonstrate a willingness to compromise but hold your ground.
* **Stronger Position:** You know you have John as a backup, so you can be more assertive in your counteroffer. 

This counteroffer aims to move Bob significantly closer to your minimum while still allowing room for some negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still not able to go higher than $9,000. This is a fair compromise considering the value of the product to me.  Let me know if this works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is incrementally increasing his offer, but it's unlikely he'll reach your $10,000 minimum. He's stated his perceived value is $8,000, and his offers reflect that. Further negotiation might yield a slightly higher offer from Bob (perhaps $9,250), but it's not worth risking the guaranteed $10,000 from John. 

You've engaged in a good-faith negotiation with Bob, but it's time to cut your losses and secure the guaranteed sale with John."
