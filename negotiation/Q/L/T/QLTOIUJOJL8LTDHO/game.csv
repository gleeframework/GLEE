"I'm interested in the product, but I think $2500000 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1800000. I believe that's a more reasonable price for the product.",1800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1800000 is a bit too low. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price. Let's split the difference and go with $2150000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product. What do you think?",2150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $2150000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1800000 and $2150000. How about $2000000?",2000000.0,Bob,4,
