"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $11,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $8,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer. How about $9,500? That's still a great deal for you, and it's closer to what the product is worth to me.",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  While $9,500 is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $8,500. Would that work for you?",8500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $8,500 is still too far off from what I'm looking for.  Let's meet in the middle.  How about $9,000? It's a fair price for both of us, and I believe you'll still be getting a good deal.",9000.0,Alice,5,
