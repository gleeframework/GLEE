Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:**  $950,000 is significantly higher than your minimum of $800,000.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  Bob knows the product is worth $1,000,000 to him, so there's room for both of you to compromise.
* **It shows confidence:** You're not starting at the bottom, which suggests you believe in the value of your product. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'd like to get closer to its perceived value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is higher than John's, it's still significantly lower than the value I know the product holds for him. I believe there's room for further negotiation, and I'm not willing to settle for a price that's so far below the product's worth."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite there yet. While I understand your perspective on the value, $850,000 is still quite a bit below what I need to make this deal work. How about we split the difference and settle on $900,000? I believe this price is fair considering the product's value to you and my own needs."", ""product_price"": 900000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-offer is above Bob's offer:**  This shows I'm willing to compromise, but not at a huge loss to myself.
* **Focuses on fairness:**  I'm framing the price as a fair compromise, appealing to Bob's sense of reason and creating a less adversarial negotiation.
* **Leaves room for further negotiation:**  $900,000 is still below what Bob is willing to pay, but it's a step closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers, so how about $875,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $875,000 is a good compromise. While it's not my ideal price, it's significantly higher than John's offer and is closer to my minimum. 

Considering the possibility of further negotiation taking more time and potentially leading to a lower offer, accepting Bob's offer seems like the most sensible choice at this point."
