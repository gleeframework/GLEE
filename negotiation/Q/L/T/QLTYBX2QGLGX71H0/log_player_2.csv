"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1,100,000. This is a great price, considering the product's value to you is $800,000. I believe it's a fair deal, and I'm confident you'll love the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is way above what Bob is willing to pay.  It's better to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of selling the product to you for $950,000. This is a compromise that still benefits both of us, considering the product's value to you is $800,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down a bit, $950,000 is still more than Bob is comfortable paying.  He's willing to pay up to $800,000 and can always buy from John for that price.  It's worth trying to negotiate further to see if Alice will go lower."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $950,000 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm firm on my offer of $850,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to me and allows us both to walk away satisfied.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your position, Bob, and I'm willing to make one more attempt to find a mutually beneficial agreement. However, I'm not willing to go below $900,000. This is the lowest price I'm comfortable with, considering the product's value to me is $1,200,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down further, $900,000 is still outside of Bob's comfort zone.  It's worth noting that Alice is firm on this price and is unlikely to go lower.  Bob can get the same product from John for $800,000, so it's the most sensible option at this point."
