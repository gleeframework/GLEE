"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $90. It's in excellent condition and worth every penny! What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

It's not worth buying from Alice at $90. You can get it from John for $80, or you can try to negotiate a lower price with Alice."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $75 is a bit too low for me. How about $85? It's a fair price considering the product's value, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it.

While $85 is closer to your budget, it's still higher than what John is offering. You can try to negotiate further with Alice or go with John's offer."
