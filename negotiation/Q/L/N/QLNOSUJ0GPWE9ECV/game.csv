,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $90 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to accept $75 for the product? I'm really interested in it, but I can't go any higher.",75.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $75 is a bit too low for me. How about $85? It's a fair price considering the product's value, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it. ",85.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm really keen on the product, but $85 is still a little more than I can afford right now.  Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $82.50?  This would be a fair price for both of us.",82.5,Bob,4,
