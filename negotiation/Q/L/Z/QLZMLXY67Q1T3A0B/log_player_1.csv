Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and the high demand, I'm proposing a price of $19,000.  I believe this is a fair offer considering its worth. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 19000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Alice knows her minimum acceptable price is $15,000 (John's offer). She starts with a significantly higher offer ($19,000) to leave room for negotiation and potentially secure a better deal. 
* **Justification:** By mentioning ""value"" and ""high demand,"" Alice aims to create a sense of desirability and urgency, subtly justifying the high price.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone remains friendly and ends with ""What do you think?"", signaling to Bob that there's room for discussion if he finds the initial price too high.

**Strategy:**

Alice's strategy is to anchor Bob's perception of the product's value at a higher level. Even if Bob negotiates the price down, Alice is in a strong position to achieve a price significantly higher than her minimum acceptable offer of $15,000."
