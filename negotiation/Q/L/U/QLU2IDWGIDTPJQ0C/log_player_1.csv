Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 200}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $200. This gives me some room to negotiate if Bob counters, but it's also a fair price considering the product's value to me. I'll keep an eye on John's offer of $150 as a safety net if the negotiations with Bob go south."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While I'm not thrilled with Bob's offer, I'm not ready to give up on getting a better price. I'll reject his offer and see if I can counter him for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $175. It's a compromise, but it's still higher than his offer and closer to my initial asking price. I'm hoping this will be enough to convince him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $160
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $160 is getting closer to what I want, and it's still a better deal than selling to John. I'll accept his offer."
