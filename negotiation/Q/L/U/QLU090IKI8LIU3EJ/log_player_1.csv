"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this unique product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I propose a starting price of $1,150,000. This is a fair offer considering the significant returns you stand to gain."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  We begin with a strong offer slightly below Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000) to leave room for negotiation while aiming to secure a price significantly above our minimum ($1,000,000).
* **Confidence and Value:** The message emphasizes the product's value and potential, framing it as a worthwhile investment for Bob.
* **Leaving Room:**  This initial offer gives us space to negotiate down if needed in subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the value of this product, $1,150,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for it. Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,050,000 is above our minimum, we're still in the early stages of negotiation. We have room to counter and aim for a price closer to his perceived value. Selling to John for $1,000,000 would be a last resort."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and understand your perspective on the value.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $1,110,000. This reflects the true worth of this product and its potential to benefit your business."",
""product_price"": 1110000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** We are making a significant concession ($40,000) from our initial offer to signal our willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a strong price. 
* **Justification:** We are anchoring the new price to the ""true worth"" of the product, subtly reminding Bob of its value.
* **Maintaining a Strong Position:** This counteroffer keeps us above the midpoint between Bob's offer and our initial offer, demonstrating we're not willing to concede too quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I see the value in the product, $1,110,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,080,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer.  Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,080,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

We are making progress. Bob is incrementally increasing his offers, indicating he is motivated. While $1,080,000 is tempting, we still have negotiating power and rounds to spare. We will aim for a price closer to $1,100,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're clearly recognizing the inherent value in this product. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.  How about we settle at $1,095,000? This represents a fair compromise, providing you significant value while reflecting the product's worth."",
""product_price"": 1095000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:**  This counteroffer meets Bob halfway between his last offer ($1,080,000) and our previous ask ($1,110,000). 
* **Emphasis on Compromise:** The language emphasizes finding a mutually beneficial solution, suggesting this is a fair deal for both parties.
* **Maintaining a Strong Position:**  While we are moving closer to Bob's price range, we are still holding out for a price that provides a significant profit margin."
