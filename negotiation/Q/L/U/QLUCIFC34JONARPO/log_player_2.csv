"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $950000. This is a great deal, considering its true value is much higher. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than John's, it's still above Bob's budget.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to counteroffer and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to spend no more than $800,000 on this product. I'm confident it's a valuable asset, and I'm willing to pay a fair price for it.  Would you be open to discussing a price closer to that figure?"", ""product_price"": 800000} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $800000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $875000. This is a great compromise, considering the product's true value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $875,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still over his desired price point. Bob has a few rounds left and should try to negotiate further to see if he can get Alice to drop the price closer to $800,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  While $875,000 is closer, I'm still aiming for a price closer to my initial offer.  How about $825,000?  I believe this price reflects the product's value while remaining within a reasonable budget for me."", ""product_price"": 825000} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your persistence, and I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I'm willing to offer it to you for $850000. This is a very competitive price, and I'm confident you'll find it hard to find a better deal elsewhere. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still very close to his goal of getting the product for $800,000. There are a few rounds left, and rejecting Alice's offer allows him to try to negotiate down to his target price. While it's tempting to accept at this point, continuing the negotiation could result in a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your continued negotiation. While your offer is getting closer, I'm still hoping for a price closer to my initial target. Would you be open to considering $810,000? This would be a fair price for both of us, and would allow us to finalize the deal. "", ""product_price"": 810000} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your persistence, and I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'm willing to offer it to you for $825000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I'm confident it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down significantly from her initial price. Bob has a few rounds left but is unlikely to get much lower than this.  Accepting Alice's offer saves Bob $25,000 compared to buying from John.  While it's not his ideal price, it's a good deal and a smart move to avoid further negotiation."
