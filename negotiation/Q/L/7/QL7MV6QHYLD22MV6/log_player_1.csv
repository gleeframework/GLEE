This offer starts at a price that's above Bob's perceived value but below your minimum, leaving room for negotiation. This strategy aims to maximize your earnings while also keeping Bob engaged in the process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you considering my budget.  I'm really interested in the product, but $12000 is a bit too high for me right now.  Would you be willing to go down to $9000?  I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $9,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum value of $15,000. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget concerns, but $9,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but how about $10,500? This price still allows for a reasonable profit for me, and I believe it's a fair deal for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10500} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you being willing to come down in price. $10500 is still a bit high for me, but I'm happy to meet you halfway. How about $9750? This would give us both a good deal and avoid the need to go back and forth further. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,750 is closer to my minimum value, it's still not ideal.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can push him a little further.  I'm also keeping John in mind as a backup option."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating with you, but $9,750 is still not quite where I need to be. How about $10,000? It's a fair compromise, and it allows me to get a bit closer to my desired price while still giving you a great deal.  Let's try to wrap this up, as I'm also considering other offers.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
