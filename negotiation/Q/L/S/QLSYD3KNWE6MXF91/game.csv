"Alice, $20,000 is way above my budget.  I'm interested in the product, but I can only offer $10,000 at this time.  Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is significantly less than what I'm willing to accept.  This product has a lot of value that I believe you'd benefit from. How about we meet in the middle at $17,000?",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $17,000 is still too high for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $13,500?  That seems fair to both of us.",13500.0,Bob,4,
