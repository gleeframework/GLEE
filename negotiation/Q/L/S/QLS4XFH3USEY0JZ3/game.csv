"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. My initial offer is $1,400,000. I'm open to negotiations and look forward to hearing your thoughts.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Considering its value to me, I'd be willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product.  This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident it would be mutually beneficial.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,100,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for the product. My revised offer is $1,300,000. I believe this is a reasonable compromise that still allows us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you need to get a fair price, and I'm happy to continue negotiating.  However, $1,300,000 is still a bit outside my budget.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,200,000, which is a significant move from my previous offer.  This is my final offer, and I believe it's a good compromise for both of us.",1200000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer. However, I still need to consider my minimum price for the product. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target. My revised offer is $1,250,000. I believe this is a fair price that takes into account the value of the product and the negotiations we've had so far.",1250000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting closer! $1,250,000 is still a bit more than I'm able to comfortably spend.  To show my commitment to this deal, I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,150,000.  This is a significant increase from my previous offer, and I truly believe it's a fair price that reflects the value of the product and our ongoing negotiations.  I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement on this final offer.",1150000.0,Bob,6,
