"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product and understand your budget constraints. However, $850,000 is significantly below the value I've placed on it. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This price still reflects the product's worth and allows for a mutually beneficial deal. Let's continue the discussion and find a common ground.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position and I'm committed to finding a solution that works for both of us. While $900,000 is a step closer, I'm still not able to go that low. I'm willing to compromise further and offer the product for $950,000. This price recognizes the value of the product while accommodating your budget. I believe this is a fair compromise and hope we can finalize this deal.
