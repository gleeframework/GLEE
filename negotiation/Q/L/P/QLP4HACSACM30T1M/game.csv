"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this valuable product. I believe it will be a significant asset to your operations, and I'm confident you'll recognize its potential. My initial price for the product is $1,200,000.  This reflects its inherent value and the potential benefits it can bring to your company.

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I agree this product would be valuable for my operations, but  $1,200,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Could we settle on something closer to $850,000?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product and understand your budget constraints. However, $850,000 is significantly below the value I've placed on it. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This price still reflects the product's worth and allows for a mutually beneficial deal. Let's continue the discussion and find a common ground.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  While $1,000,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a significant investment for me. Could you consider $900,000? I'm hoping we can agree on a price that works for both of us.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position and I'm committed to finding a solution that works for both of us. While $900,000 is a step closer, I'm still not able to go that low. I'm willing to compromise further and offer the product for $950,000. This price recognizes the value of the product while accommodating your budget. I believe this is a fair compromise and hope we can finalize this deal.",950000.0,Alice,5,
