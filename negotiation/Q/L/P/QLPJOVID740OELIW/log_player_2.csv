"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'm willing to offer you the product for $900000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $1200000. I believe this is a fair starting point, and I'm open to negotiations. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $750000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $850000. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's value to you, while also being a significant discount from the original price. What do you think?

Alice's offer of $850,000 is better than her initial offer, but still above your desired price point. You can likely negotiate a lower price by making another counteroffer."
