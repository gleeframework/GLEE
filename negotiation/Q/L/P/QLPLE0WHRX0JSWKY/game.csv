"Alice,  $1,200,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000, which is still a good deal for you considering the value you'll gain from this product. Let's meet in the middle.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too high.  I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000.  Let's meet in the middle again.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,000,000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product for you. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,050,000.  This is my final offer before I explore other options. Let me know your decision.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
