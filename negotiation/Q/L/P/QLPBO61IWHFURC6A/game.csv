"Bob, I'm confident this product is worth a significant investment for you, and I'm prepared to offer it to you at a price that reflects its value.  How does $1,150,000 sound?",1150000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but that price is a bit high for me. Would you consider $1,050,000?",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your counteroffer.  While I understand your perspective, $1,050,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000 to make this deal work.  Let's find a price that's fair for both of us.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I'm getting closer to your asking price, but I need to see a little more movement to make it work on my end. How about $1,075,000?",1075000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm starting to think we might not be able to reach an agreement.  $1,075,000 is still a bit below what I need to make this worthwhile.  I'm willing to make one final concession and offer the product for $1,090,000.  If this isn't acceptable, I'll need to explore other options.",1090000.0,Alice,5,
