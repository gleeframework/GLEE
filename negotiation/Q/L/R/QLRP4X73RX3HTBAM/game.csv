"Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's something I've carefully cultivated and I'm confident it could significantly benefit your business. I'm willing to offer it to you at a price that reflects its potential worth.  Let's discuss a price of $1,400,000. This would allow you a significant return on your investment, and it's a fair price for the value it brings.  Please let me know your thoughts.",1400000.0,Alice,1,
