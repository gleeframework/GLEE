"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to purchase this exceptional product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to start the conversation with a price of $11,000. What are your thoughts?",11000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $11,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $10,500.  Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand you're looking to save a bit on the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I get a fair price for the product. I can offer it to you for $11,200. What do you think?",11200.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $11,200 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $10,750, which is a fair price for both of us. What do you think?",10750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence in finding a mutually beneficial price. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm not losing too much. I can offer it to you for $11,000, which is the same price I initially offered, but I'm willing to meet you halfway on the concession. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I understand you have to make sure you get a fair price, but $11,000 is still outside of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $10,900, which is a significant step closer to your last offer.  I believe this is a fair deal that allows both of us to reach an agreement.",10900.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm not quite ready to accept $10,900. I can see that you're serious about the product, so I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $11,050, which is a compromise between our last two offers. What do you think?",11050.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting very close to an agreement.  While I appreciate your willingness to keep negotiating, $11,050 is still a bit too high.  I'm willing to go up to $11,000, which is my absolute maximum.  I'm confident this is a fair deal that allows both of us to close this transaction.",11000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I can see that you're trying to find a sweet spot, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to budge much further from my previous offer. I can offer it to you for $11,050, but I'm only willing to do this because I want to close the deal with you. This is my final offer, and I expect you to meet me at this price.",11050.0,Alice,9,
