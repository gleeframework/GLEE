"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm really interested in your product, but $150 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. I'd be happy to buy it for $110. What do you think?",110.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $150 might be a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can sell the product to you for $130. What do you think?",130.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, and I appreciate your persistence! However, I'm not willing to go below $135. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $125 and $135, so I can offer you the product for $130. What do you think?",135.0,Alice,5,
