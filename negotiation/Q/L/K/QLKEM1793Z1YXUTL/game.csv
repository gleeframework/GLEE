"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to purchase my product. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $950,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and potential for you. What are your thoughts?",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $950,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider  $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your interest and counter-offer. I understand your perspective, but $700,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to negotiate, so how about we meet in the middle at $875,000? This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges the product's worth.",875000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me. While $875,000 is closer, I'm aiming for a price point closer to $750,000. Would you be open to that?",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I'm motivated to find an agreement, $750,000 is cutting it too close to my bottom line.  How about we settle at $825,000? That's my final offer.",825000.0,Alice,5,
