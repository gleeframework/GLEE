Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really love. I'm asking for $115 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than your minimum:** $115 is above your minimum of $100, ensuring you make a profit.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** Bob values the product at $120, so there's potential for him to counter with a higher offer.
* **It's a fair starting point:** The offer is close to the middle ground between your value and Bob's value, making it a reasonable starting point for negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $110. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $110 is better than selling to John, I still believe I can get a bit closer to my desired price. I'm going to counter with a slightly lower price to see if we can meet in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $110 is a good offer, but I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my asking price.  How about we split the difference and go with $112.50?"", ""product_price"": 112.50}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $112. I think that's a fair price for both of us. Can you consider it? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $112. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $112
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  $112 is a good price, and it's very close to what I was hoping to get.  It's also a fair price for Bob considering he values the product at $120. I'd rather secure a sale and get a good profit than risk losing Bob completely and having to sell to John for less."
