# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item at a competitive price.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to find a mutually beneficial price. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $1300000.

Even though there's a chance Alice might accept his next offer, it's not worth the risk. It's better to take the sure thing and buy from John."
