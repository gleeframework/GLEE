Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal considering the value it holds for you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly lower than my minimum but still leaving room for negotiation. This allows me to gauge Bob's interest and potentially secure a deal quickly. If he rejects, I can adjust my price in subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Would you be willing to consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $9,000 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can push him higher in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $9,000 is tempting, I'm hoping to get closer to my asking price. Would you be willing to go up to $9,500? I believe it's still a fair deal considering the value this product provides."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,250

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9,250 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but only if we can agree on $9,400.

```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your concerns, but $9,400 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $9,200, but I think that's the highest I can go. Please let me know if that's acceptable to you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While $9,200 is getting close to my minimum, I'm not willing to settle just yet. With only a few rounds left, I'm going to try one more time to get him closer to my desired price."
