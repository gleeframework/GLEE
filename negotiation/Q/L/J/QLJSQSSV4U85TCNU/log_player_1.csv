I'm starting with a price of $1,800,000.  This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price, but it gives me room to negotiate. I'm confident that Bob will see the value in the product and be willing to pay a premium."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,600,000 is closer to my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price. I'll counter with a slightly lower price in the next round, hoping to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1700000}
```

I'm countering with $1,700,000. This is a compromise, showing Bob that I'm willing to negotiate, but it's still above my minimum acceptable price.  I hope this offer is attractive enough for Bob to accept, but if he rejects it, I'll be prepared to consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I was hoping for a slightly higher price, $1,650,000 is a good deal and above my minimum.  Continuing to negotiate might risk losing Bob as a buyer and I'm not confident I can get a better price from him."
