"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling this amazing product to you. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,500. This is a great deal, and I'm sure you won't find a better price anywhere else.",9500.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, I'm looking to spend a bit less.  Would you consider $8,500? It's still a good deal for you, and it's within my budget.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that you're looking to spend a bit less, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go below $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $9,250. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment.",9250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $9,250 is still a bit higher than what I can comfortably spend.  How about we split the difference at $9,000?  This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can finalize the deal.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to find a fair price, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go below $9,200. I'm willing to make a small concession and offer it to you for $9,150. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",9150.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I see we're getting closer.  $9,150 is still a bit out of my range. How about we meet at $9,050? I believe this would be a mutually beneficial price, and we could finalise the deal. ",9050.0,Bob,6,

"I'm willing to make another concession, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go below $9,100. I'll offer it to you for $9,100. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",9100.0,Alice,7,
