{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is way above your maximum budget.  It's best to reject and see if you can negotiate a better price.  There's no reason to buy from John yet, as you haven't seen how far Alice is willing to come down."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial price, but still within a range that might be acceptable to her. This demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while also setting a firm upper limit on my budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high, even though she's come down slightly.  I'm going to continue negotiating to try and get closer to my target price.  Buying from John is still an option, but I want to see how much further Alice is willing to budge."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly from the previous round. This shows that I'm willing to compromise, but also that I'm not going to accept an offer that's significantly above my desired price. It's a delicate balance, but I'm aiming to find a sweet spot where Alice feels motivated to sell while still leaving me room for some profit."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is coming down in price, but it's still a bit higher than what I'd like to pay.  I'm going to continue negotiating. It's likely we're getting closer to a deal, but there's still room for improvement. Buying from John is always an option, but I want to see if I can squeeze a slightly better price out of Alice first."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer again, showing that I'm taking Alice's concessions seriously and am ready to meet her halfway. However, it's still below her current offer, signaling that I'm not going to accept a price too close to her initial valuation.  We're getting closer to a deal, and this counteroffer is intended to test the waters and see how willing Alice is to close the gap."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly willing to negotiate, but her offer is still above my target price.  I'm going to continue negotiating, as I believe there's still room for further compromise. While buying from John is a safe option, I'm confident that I can get a better deal with Alice."
