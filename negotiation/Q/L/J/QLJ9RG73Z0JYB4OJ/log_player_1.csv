I'm going to start high, knowing that Bob values the product at $1,000,000. This gives me room to negotiate and still make a profit.  I'm also aware of John's offer of $1,500,000, which serves as my safety net."

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting to accept and make a quick profit, I believe I can do better. Bob's counteroffer shows he's willing to negotiate, and I'm confident I can get a higher price. I have John's offer as a backup, so I'm not pressured to settle for a low price."
