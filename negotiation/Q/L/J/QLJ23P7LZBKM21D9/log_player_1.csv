"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm interested in the product, but $1750000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $1400000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to be within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,400,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price. I'm confident I can get a better deal by continuing the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,400,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to be closer to my asking price.  How about $1,600,000? This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us both to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. "", ""product_price"": 1600000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1600000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to be closer to my target. How about $1550000? I think that's a fair price that reflects the value of the product to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,550,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While I'd prefer to push for a higher price, Bob's offer of $1,550,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price and is a good deal considering we're only four rounds into the negotiation.  Accepting this offer minimizes risk and gets me a good return."
