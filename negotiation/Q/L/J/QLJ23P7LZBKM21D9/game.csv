"Alice, I'm interested in the product, but $1750000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $1400000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to be within my budget.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1400000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to be closer to my asking price.  How about $1600000? This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us both to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. ",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1600000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to be closer to my target. How about $1550000? I think that's a fair price that reflects the value of the product to me.",1550000.0,Bob,4,
