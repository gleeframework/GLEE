"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum, but I'm hoping to gauge Bob's interest and see how much he's willing to pay. If he's not interested at this price, I'll have to adjust my strategy."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $12,000 is better than my minimum, I'm not willing to settle yet. There are still 8 rounds left. I'm going to make a counteroffer to see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
```

I'm lowering my price a bit to $13,500. It's a compromise, showing Bob that I'm open to negotiation but still trying to get a good price for my product. This should hopefully keep the negotiations going and potentially lead to a deal closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm still holding out for a better price. $12,500 is getting closer to my desired price, but I think I can push for a little more. We're already halfway through the rounds, so I need to be careful, but I'm not ready to settle yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

I'm going to counter with $13,000. This is a slight increase from my previous offer but still lower than my initial asking price. Hopefully, Bob will see this as a sign of good faith and be willing to meet me in the middle. If not, I might need to start considering the $10,000 offer from John in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $12,200 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still hesitant to accept. With only 4 rounds left, I need to be careful about the risk of not reaching a deal with Bob. However, I believe there's still room for negotiation, and I'm going to try one more time to get a better offer from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12,700}
```

I'm going to counter with $12,700. It's a small increase from Bob's last offer, but it's a signal that I'm willing to compromise. With only 3 rounds left, I need to find a balance between getting a good price and avoiding the risk of losing the deal altogether.  Hopefully, Bob will see this as a fair compromise and accept my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,300. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,300
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer of $12,300. With only two rounds left, the risk of not reaching a deal is too high. While I would have preferred a higher price, $12,300 is still above my minimum and a good deal considering the time pressure."
