"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,000,000. I'm confident this will be a worthwhile investment for you.",1000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product, but I believe I can't commit to such a high price. Would you consider lowering the price to $900,000? This would allow me to make a more reasonable investment.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I'm motivated to find a fair deal,  $900,000 is below its true value. How about we meet in the middle at $950,000? This reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your interest.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. However, considering my budget constraints, I am unable to agree to $950,000. Could you perhaps lower the price to $850,000? This would bring us closer to a mutually beneficial agreement.",850000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position and want to find a solution that works for both of us.  I'm willing to come down slightly more to $920,000. This is my final offer, as it significantly discounts the product's true value while recognizing your interest in it.",920000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. Considering my financial situation, I would like to propose an offer of $880,000. This brings us closer to my budget limit while still reflecting the value of the product. I hope this proposal is acceptable.",880000.0,Bob,6,
