Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really love it! I'm willing to let it go for $130. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 
 
This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:** This gives Bob some room to negotiate without feeling like he's getting a bad deal.
* **It's below your minimum:** This leaves you with some wiggle room if Bob makes a counteroffer.
* **It's a clear and concise message:** This makes it easy for Bob to understand your offer. 

This strategy allows you to potentially maximize your profit while still leaving the door open for a successful negotiation with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I really like the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $100 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $100 just doesn't work for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $115? It's still a good price for you, and I'm willing to compromise."", ""product_price"": 115}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $110? I'm really interested in the product, but I'm trying to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While $110 is still lower than my ideal price, it's getting closer to my minimum.  I'm willing to accept this offer and move on, as it's better than selling to John for $150. It's important to remember that continuing negotiations with Bob risks him walking away entirely, and then I'd be left with only John as an option."
