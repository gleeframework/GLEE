"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find very valuable.  I'm offering it to you for $95.  What do you think?

Alice's initial offer is too high. I'm willing to negotiate to try and get a better price."

}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you making a counteroffer, but $70 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $85?  Let's try to find a price that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you coming up on your offer.  While $77.50 is getting closer, I'm still not quite there yet. How about we split the difference and go with $81.25? That would be a fair compromise for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $81.25. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $81.25
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
