"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to show you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $180. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $100. It's definitely worth rejecting and trying to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, $180 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in the product, but my budget is closer to $100. Would you be willing to come down to $120?"", ""product_price"": 120}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial offer, but it's still within your budget. It shows that you're serious about buying the product, but you're also firm about your price limit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob. I can do $160, but I'm not sure I can go any lower than that. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $160
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still higher than my preferred price point. However, it's getting closer. I'm going to try one more counteroffer before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $160 is still a bit out of my range.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $140?  I'm really interested in the product, and I believe this price is fair for both of us."", ""product_price"": 140}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a compromise between Alice's last offer and my ideal price.  I'm hoping to show her that I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm also sticking to my budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're really interested in the product, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to propose a price of $155. I think it's a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $155. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $155
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is getting closer to my budget, her offer of $155 is still above my maximum of $100.  At this point, it's more advantageous to take the guaranteed deal with John at $100. I've already spent a few rounds negotiating, and I'm not confident I can get Alice down to my price point within the remaining rounds."
