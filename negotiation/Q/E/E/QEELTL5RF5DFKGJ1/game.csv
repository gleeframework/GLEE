"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested,  $1,200,000 is a bit high for me right now. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me. What do you think?",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. Considering its value to you is $1,500,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer it to you for $1,300,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe you'll find it's a great deal.
