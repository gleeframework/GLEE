"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product! It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $100.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm really interested but $100 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay.  How about $85? Let's see if we can make this work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
The product is worth $120 to me, and Bob's offer of $85 is still significantly lower. I'll try to get closer to my value in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $95.  Let's see if we can find some common ground here."", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $95.  I'm still a bit hesitant at that price.  Would you consider $90? I'm really interested in this product, and I think this price is fair for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer of $90 is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum value of $120. I'll try to negotiate further to see if I can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  $90 is getting closer, but I'm still a bit away from where I need to be. How about $93?  This would be a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it worthwhile."", ""product_price"": 93}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $93 is closer, but I'm still hoping we can meet in the middle. How about $91?  That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm really eager to get this product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $91. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $91
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json

While $91 is getting closer, I'm still holding out for a bit more. It's important for me to get as close to my minimum value as possible. I'll counter again in the next round."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
