"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $5,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to negotiate.  How about $9,000?  This price still gives you a great deal, and it's closer to what I need to make this worthwhile for me.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $7,000 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to go a little further.  How about $8,500?  That's a fair price that gives you a great deal and ensures I get a reasonable return on the product.  Let's close this deal!",8500.0,Alice,5,
