"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $15,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it. Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your position, but $9,000 is quite a bit lower than what I had in mind.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,000? I'm confident you'll find it's a fair price for the value this product brings.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $13,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm comfortable paying $10,000. This would be a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to stay within my budget. ",10000.0,Bob,4,
