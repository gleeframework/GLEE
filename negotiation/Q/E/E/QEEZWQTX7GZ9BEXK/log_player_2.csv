"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'd like to offer you a great deal on this amazing product. It's a unique opportunity to own something that's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to let it go for a fair price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

``` 

While it's slightly above Alice's value, $140 is still less than your maximum budget and cheaper than buying from John."
