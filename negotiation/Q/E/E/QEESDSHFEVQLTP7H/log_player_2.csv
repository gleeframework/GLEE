Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. While $9,000 is less than his maximum, he can likely get a better deal by negotiating.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to start the counteroffer process and potentially secure a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is starting with a counteroffer that is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still above Alice's perceived value of the product. This demonstrates Bob's willingness to negotiate, while also setting a clear starting point for the negotiation."

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's counteroffer is higher than Bob's previous offer. Bob can still try to negotiate a lower price.  Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation open and gives Bob another opportunity to make a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8800}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is increasing his offer slightly from the previous round, demonstrating a willingness to compromise. This counteroffer is still below Alice's perceived value of the product, but it's closer to her initial offer, showing Bob's seriousness about reaching an agreement. This approach aims to find a middle ground and potentially reach a deal in the next round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is getting increasingly closer to Bob's maximum price. However, with only 5 rounds left, the risk of not reaching an agreement is increasing.  Buying from John at $12,000 guarantees the product while limiting the potential for further negotiation. Although it's not the best price, it's still within Bob's budget and ensures he gets the product."
