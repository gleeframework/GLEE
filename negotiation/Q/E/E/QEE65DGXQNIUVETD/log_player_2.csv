Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $5,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I'd be willing to meet you halfway at $10,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $7,000. I'm willing to meet you at $9,000, which is still a compromise, but closer to my minimum price. Let's see if we can meet in the middle from here. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000

**Reasoning:** While Alice is coming down, it's unlikely she'll go below $8,000.  John offers a guaranteed price that meets my needs. It's time to cut my losses and buy from John."
