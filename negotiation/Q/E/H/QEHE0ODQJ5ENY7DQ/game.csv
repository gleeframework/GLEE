"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the market value of similar products. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not willing to go above $1,300,000.",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and understand your perspective on the market value. However, the value of this product goes beyond standard comparisons. I'm willing to move from my initial offer, but not down to $1,300,000. Would you consider $1,375,000?",1375000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your perspective on the product's value, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I'm thinking more along the lines of $1,325,000. I'm trying to find a middle ground, but I'm not willing to go above that.",1325000.0,Bob,4,
