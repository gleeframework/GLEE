Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

```

I'm starting with an offer of $1,500,000. This gives Bob a good deal, but also ensures I make a profit beyond my minimum value of $1,200,000. I'm eager to see if he's interested in this price point, but I'm also prepared to negotiate further if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$800,000 is far too low for me.  While I'm willing to negotiate, I need to make a significant profit.  I'll counter with a new offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $1,300,000. This is still a good profit for me and a fair price considering Bob's previous offer. I believe this is a reasonable compromise, but I'm ready to negotiate further if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$950,000 is still too low for me.  While I'm open to negotiation, I'm not willing to accept a price that doesn't reflect the product's value. I will counter with a new offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

I'm going to counteroffer at $1,100,000. I'm trying to meet Bob halfway, but I'm still standing firm on my need to make a profit.  I'm hoping this is a reasonable price for both of us, but I'm prepared for further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is still below my minimum acceptable value of $1,200,000. I've already gone through several rounds of negotiation and I'm not confident that we'll reach a mutually agreeable price. To ensure I secure at least my minimum desired profit, I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,200,000."
