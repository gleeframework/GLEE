"Hello Alice, thanks for your offer. While I recognize the value of the product, your starting price is a bit high for me. I'm interested in purchasing it, but I'd be willing to pay around $6,000.  Let me know what you think.",6000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but $6,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to make a profit. How about we try $9,000?",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me closer to the middle.  While $9,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a touch high for my budget. How about we settle at $7,000? That feels like a fair compromise.",7000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $7,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target. How about we meet at $8,500?",8500.0,Alice,5,
