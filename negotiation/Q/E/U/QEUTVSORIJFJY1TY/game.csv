"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am looking to stay within a budget of $80. Would you be willing to negotiate down to $100?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $100 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $125, which is still a good price for you considering the value of the product. Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I really appreciate it. Considering my budget, could we possibly meet somewhere around $110? I believe this would be a fair compromise.",110.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $110 is closer, it's still below my minimum price. How about we split the difference and settle on $117.50? It's a good deal for both of us, and we can finally close this deal.",117.5,Alice,5,
