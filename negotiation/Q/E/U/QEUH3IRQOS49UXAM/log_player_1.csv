Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $100, which is above Bob's perceived value but still lower than my minimum acceptable price. This gives me room to negotiate down if needed.
* **Positive Framing:**  I'm framing the offer as a good deal for Bob, which might encourage him to accept.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm making it clear that I'm open to negotiation, signaling flexibility.
* **Backup Plan:**  I have John as a backup buyer, so I'm not desperate to sell to Bob at any price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $100 is a bit too high for my budget.  Would you consider $65? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $65. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $65
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $65 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $120, and even below my initial offer of $100.  
* **Negotiation Room:**  I have room to counteroffer without going below my minimum. 
* **John is a better option:**  John is willing to pay my minimum price, making him the more attractive option at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $65 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $85.  That's still a great price for a product worth much more.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 85} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** I'm offering a price halfway between my initial offer ($100) and Bob's counteroffer ($65). This shows willingness to compromise. 
* **Still Above Minimum:**  $85 is still higher than my minimum acceptable price, so I'm not losing money.
* **Positive Framing:** I'm emphasizing the value of the product to encourage Bob to accept."
