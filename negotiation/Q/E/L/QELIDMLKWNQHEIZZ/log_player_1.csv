Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think you'd be interested. I'm asking for $140 for it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's higher than Bob's perceived value, but it leaves room for negotiation.  It's important to be polite and inviting to encourage Bob to engage with the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $130. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $130 is closer to my minimum price, I'm not willing to settle just yet. I believe I can still get a higher price from Bob, or at least stay closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. $130 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down a little. How about $135? It's still a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 135}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $135 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $128. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $128. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $128
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While I'm getting closer to my minimum price, I'm still not ready to settle for $128. I think I can still push for a slightly higher price with another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to negotiate.  $128 is still a little low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $131?  That's a fair price for both of us, and I think it's a good deal for you as well."", ""product_price"": 131}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit short of my budget. I'm willing to pay $129. Would you be willing to accept that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $129. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $129
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

At this point,  $129 is getting very close to my minimum price, and it's likely that Bob won't go any higher. It's a better deal than selling to John, so I'll accept Bob's offer."
