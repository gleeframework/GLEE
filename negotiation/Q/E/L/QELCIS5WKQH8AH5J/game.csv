"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $13000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's worth to you is $15000. I believe it's a fair compromise that benefits both of us.",13000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $11500. I'm willing to make a compromise, but I'd like to see if we can meet in the middle. What do you think?",11500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your desire to meet in the middle, but I'm not willing to go as low as $11500. Considering the product's value to you is $15000, I'm willing to compromise and meet you halfway between our initial offers. I'm proposing a new price of $12500. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's value to you, while also being reasonable for me.",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our initial offers, but I think we can do better than $12500. I'm proposing a new price of $12000. Can you consider this compromise?",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price of $12000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to prioritize my own interests. I'm proposing a new price of $12750. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I hope you can understand that it's still a fair compromise considering the product's value to you.",12750.0,Alice,5,
