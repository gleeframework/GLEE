I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's tempting, I'm holding out for a better price closer to my valuation. I'm confident I can get a higher price from Bob, or at least secure John's offer as a backup."

Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is the same as John's offer.  This is a good deal for me, as I can sell the product for my minimum acceptable price and avoid further negotiation."
