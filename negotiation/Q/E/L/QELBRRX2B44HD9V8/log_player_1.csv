Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for your offer. This product is interesting to me, but your asking price is a little too high for my budget. I'd be willing to pay $750,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1,200,000 is still a bit too steep for me. I'm willing to increase my offer to $900,000.  That's a significant investment for me, but I believe the product could be worth it at that price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000

While Bob is showing interest, his offer is still significantly below my minimum.  It's time to move on to John who is offering a price that reflects the product's true value."
