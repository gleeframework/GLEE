You can get a better deal than $100, so rejecting the offer makes sense.  You'll try to negotiate a lower price with Alice."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to spend a bit less, but I have to make sure I get a fair price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $100 and $85, so I'll offer it to you for $92.50.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to get closer to the value I have in mind. I'll offer it to you for $90.50, which is just a bit more than my previous offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90.5. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice is willing to meet you halfway again.  $90.50 is still a good deal for you, and if you keep negotiating, you might not get a better offer.  It is better to accept Alice's offer and secure the product at a good price."
