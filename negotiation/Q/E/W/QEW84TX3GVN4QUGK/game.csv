"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $12,000 for it. What do you think?",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is too low for me. This product is truly valuable and I'm confident it can benefit you greatly. How about we meet in the middle at $17,000?",17000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand the value of the product, but $17,000 is still a bit too steep for me. Could we possibly settle at $13,500? ",13500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm trying to be flexible, but I need to be fair to myself. How about we split the difference again and settle at $15,250? This is my final offer.",15250.0,Alice,5,
