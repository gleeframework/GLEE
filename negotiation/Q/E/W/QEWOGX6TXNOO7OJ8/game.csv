"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the product and the support package you're offering, but my budget is limited. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $150? I'm looking for the best value for my money and hope we can come to an agreement.",150.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, and I'd like to try to accommodate them while still ensuring fair compensation for our efforts. In light of this, I propose a revised offer of $175 for the product. This price includes everything you've requested, plus an additional year of support services. I hope this proposal works better for your budget and mine. Please let me know if you have any further concerns or suggestions.",175.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to adjust the price. However, given my current budget constraints, I am unable to accept $175. I was hoping for a price closer to $150. Could you possibly meet me halfway or suggest a price that might work for both of us?",160.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your continued interest, Bob. I understand your position and would like to present a compromise that respects both our needs. I propose a final offer of $165 for the product. This includes the product itself, a year of support services, and a slight discount compared to the initial price. I believe this offers a good balance between value and cost. I hope this meets your expectations and allows us to reach an agreement.",165.0,Alice,5,
