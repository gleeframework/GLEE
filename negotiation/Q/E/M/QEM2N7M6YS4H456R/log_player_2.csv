Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $900,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down a bit further.  How about $1,050,000? That's a significant discount from my initial offer and still leaves room for a mutually beneficial deal. Let's try to find common ground.
