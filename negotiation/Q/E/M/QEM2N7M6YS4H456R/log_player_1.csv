Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's worth less than $1,100,000 to me. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  $900,000 is too far below my minimum acceptable price. I'll try to get closer to my desired price in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $900,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down a bit further.  How about $1,050,000? That's a significant discount from my initial offer and still leaves room for a mutually beneficial deal. Let's try to find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:

While $950,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still not willing to sell at that price. I'll try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $950,000 simply doesn't work for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway this time. Let's try $1,000,000.  This would be a fair price for both of us.  Let's get this deal done."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

Round 6
Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $980,000 is closer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  I have a guaranteed buyer in John, so I'm not going to settle for less. I'll try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable selling below $1,000,000.  I know you're close to your limit, and I'm willing to come down a bit more to make this work.  How about $1,020,000?  That's a very reasonable price considering the value of the product to you.  Let's find a way to make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 1020000}

Round 8
Bob's offer:

I've reached my limit with Bob.  I'm not going to sell for less than $1,000,000, and he's not budging.  I'm better off selling to John and getting the price I need."
