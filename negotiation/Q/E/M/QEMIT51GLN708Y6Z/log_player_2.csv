"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's something that's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you at a very competitive price. How does $100 sound to you? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

The product is worth $120 to you and $80 to Alice. There is room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer will allow you to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you reaching out. While I'm interested, $100 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now.  How about $90? That seems like a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 90} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $90 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $95. This is a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to the value I'm looking for.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice has come down to $95, which is a good price for you considering you're willing to pay $120.  Accepting the offer saves you $25 compared to buying from John."
