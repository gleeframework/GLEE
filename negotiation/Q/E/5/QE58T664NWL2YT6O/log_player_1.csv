"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at a price significantly higher than my minimum acceptable value ($800,000) to leave room for negotiation.
* **Confidence:** The message expresses confidence in the product's value and aims to generate interest in Bob.
* **Open to discussion:**  The message invites Bob to respond and encourages further negotiation. 

This strategy allows me to gauge Bob's interest and potentially secure a high price without immediately resorting to John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of a price around $800000. Could you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is at my minimum acceptable value:** While I'm not losing money, I'm also not maximizing my potential profit. 
* **Potential for higher offer:** I have 8 rounds left.  There's still room for negotiation, and Bob has shown interest. 
* **Risk assessment:** Selling to John guarantees $800,000, but rejecting Bob's offer keeps the possibility of earning more open. 

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can try to push for a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $800,000 is my minimum, I'm confident the product's value warrants a higher price.  How about we split the difference and settle at $950,000?  It's a fair price that allows us both to benefit from this deal."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a compromise by moving closer to Bob's offer, but not giving in entirely.
* **Value Justification:** I'm still highlighting the product's value to justify my price point.
* **Fairness Appeal:**  The message emphasizes the ""fairness"" of the offer to encourage Bob's acceptance. 

This strategy aims to find a middle ground that is more profitable for me without risking a stalemate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your perspective, but $950000 is still a bit higher than my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $900000. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Progress:** Bob's offer of $900,000 is a substantial increase from his initial $800,000 offer.
* **Near My Target:**  This price is close to my desired price point and provides a good profit margin.
* **Risk of Stalemate:**  Further negotiation might lead to a stalemate, especially with limited rounds remaining.

Accepting Bob's offer secures a profitable sale and minimizes the risk of ending up with John's offer, which would yield a lower profit."
