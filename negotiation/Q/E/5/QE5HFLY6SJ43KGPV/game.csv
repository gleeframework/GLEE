"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  I believe it holds significant value, and I'm initially offering it to you for $2,300,000. This is a starting point for discussion, and I'm open to hearing your thoughts on this.",2300000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for your offer.  That price is way too high for me though. If you're willing to come down to $600,000, I think we could make a deal.",600000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate you countering.  That offer is too low for me to consider, but I'm motivated to find a fair price. How about we meet in the middle somewhere around $1,450,000? This reflects the true value of this product.",1450000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're still quite a ways off.  While I believe the product has value, $1,450,000 is not feasible for me. I could potentially stretch my budget to $700,000 if that interests you at all.",700000.0,Bob,4,
