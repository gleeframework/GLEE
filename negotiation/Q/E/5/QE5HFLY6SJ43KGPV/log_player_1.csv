Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're still quite a ways off.  While I believe the product has value, $1,450,000 is not feasible for me. I could potentially stretch my budget to $700,000 if that interests you at all.

Bob is nowhere near a reasonable offer. It's time to cut bait and take John's guaranteed $1,500,000."
