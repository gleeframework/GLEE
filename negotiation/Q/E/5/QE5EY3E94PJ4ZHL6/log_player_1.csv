Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing an initial price of $1,300,000. I'm confident this is a fair starting point for discussion."", ""product_price"": 1300000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Negotiation often benefits from anchoring. By starting significantly higher than both your minimum ($1,000,000) and Bob's perceived value ($800,000), you create room for negotiation and potentially secure a higher final price.
* **Leaving Room for John:** While you have a guaranteed offer from John, the goal is to maximize profit.  This starting price keeps the door open for Bob to potentially offer more than John.
* **Confident Tone:** Presenting the offer with confidence suggests the product's value is truly in this higher range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Above Bob's Valuation:** Bob's offer of $900,000 is above his perceived value of $800,000, indicating he's willing to stretch to acquire the product.
* **Room for Negotiation:** There's still a significant gap between his offer and both your minimum and your initial asking price. This suggests there's room for further negotiation to reach a more favorable price.
* **John as Leverage:** You can leverage the guaranteed offer from John to encourage Bob to increase his offer closer to your desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. However, the value of this product significantly exceeds that price point. I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. This reflects the true worth of what I'm offering."", ""product_price"": 1150000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant but Strategic Concession:**  Lowering the price by $150,000 shows a willingness to negotiate, but the sizable decrease still maintains a strong position.
* **Justifying the Price:** By re-emphasizing the product's value, you counter Bob's attempt to anchor the price lower while justifying the higher figure.
* **Leaving Negotiation Room:** You're still above your minimum and have space to potentially decrease further, depending on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but $1,150,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1,050,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value without breaking the bank. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Exceeding the Alternative:** Bob's offer of $1,050,000 is now higher than John's guaranteed $1,000,000. Accepting ensures you maximize your profit in this scenario. 
* **Strong Position:** While you could potentially push for a slightly higher price, Bob has steadily increased his offer, demonstrating serious interest. Holding out for a minimal gain risks losing the deal entirely.
* **Time Value of Money:** Closing the deal now avoids further delays and allows you to reinvest the proceeds sooner, potentially generating additional returns."
