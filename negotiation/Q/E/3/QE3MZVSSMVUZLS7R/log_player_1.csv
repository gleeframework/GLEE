Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000.  It's a great deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above Bob's value:**  $10,000 is higher than the $8,000 Bob is willing to pay, but it leaves room for negotiation.
* **It's below your minimum:**  It's significantly lower than your minimum of $12,000, which is a good starting point for a negotiation.
* **It's a strong opening:** It signals that you are serious about selling, but you're not giving away the product for cheap.

This offer sets the stage for a back-and-forth negotiation that could ultimately lead to a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the suggestion, but I am only able to pay up to $9500 for the product. I hope this revised offer is acceptable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,500 is closer to your minimum, it's still below what you'd like to receive.  Since John is a sure bet at $12,000, it's worth seeing if you can get a better deal from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer.  However, I'm looking for a price closer to $11,000 to make this worthwhile for me.  Let's meet in the middle at $10,500.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
``` 

This counteroffer:

* **Splits the difference:** It sits halfway between your previous offer of $10,000 and Bob's offer of $9,500. This shows willingness to compromise.
* **Stays above your minimum:** $10,500 is still significantly above your minimum of $12,000.
* **Sets a clear target:** It establishes a clear price point for further negotiation.

Let's see if Bob is willing to meet you halfway!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm willing to consider a price of $10200 for the product. I hope this meets somewhere in the middle for us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $10,200 is only $300 below your minimum of $12,000.  Considering the potential for further negotiation with Bob to be time-consuming and potentially unsuccessful, accepting his offer at this point is the most practical choice.  It maximizes your earnings while minimizing the risk of losing out to John."
