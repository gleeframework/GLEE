,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate it, $150 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend.  How about $110?  I'm sure we can find a price we're both happy with.",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $150 is a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $110. How about we meet in the middle at $130? It's a fair price that I'm comfortable with, and I think you'll find it's a great value.",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $130 is still a bit high for me.  Let's split the difference - $125.  I'm really keen on this product, and I believe this price is fair for both of us.",125.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $125 is still a bit above your comfort zone, but I'm not willing to go any lower. I'm willing to give you a small concession, though - I'll meet you at $127. It's the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great value for the product.",127.0,Alice,5,
