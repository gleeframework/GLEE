"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to sell it to you for $80. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to make a profit. I'm now offering the product to you for $140. It's a fair price, considering the value the product brings, and I'm willing to meet you in the middle again.",140.0,Alice,5,
