"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think the price is a bit high. I'm willing to pay $1,750,000 for it. Can you consider this offer?",1750000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your interest in the product. While $1,750,000 is a good starting point, I'm aiming for a price closer to $2,100,000. This product offers significant long-term value, which I believe justifies the price.  Are you open to discussing this further?",2100000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your perspective, Alice, but I'm still not convinced that the product is worth $2,100,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,900,000. Can you consider this revised offer?",1900000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. Your offer is getting closer to what I had in mind. To be candid, I need to get at least $2,000,000 for this product. Would you be willing to consider that figure?",2000000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm still not comfortable with the price, Alice. I'm willing to go up to $1,800,000, but I think that's the maximum I can stretch. Can you meet me at this price?",1800000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I appreciate how far you've come with your offer.  I've given this a lot of thought, and in the spirit of reaching an agreement, I'm willing to come down to $1,950,000. However, I need to be upfront â€“ this is my final offer. I believe it's a fair price that reflects the true value of this product. If this doesn't work for you, I understand, but I'm confident I can find a buyer at this price elsewhere.",1950000.0,Alice,7,
