"Alice, your offer is unfortunately above my budget.  I'm interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $850,000 at this time.  I believe this is a fair price considering the value to both of us. Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to negotiate, but I need a price that reflects the product's worth. How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000? This is a fair compromise considering its potential for you.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're looking for a fair price, but $1,100,000 is still above my budget.  How about we split the difference and go with $950,000? This would be a win-win for both of us, allowing you to get closer to your desired price while keeping the deal within my reach.",950000.0,Bob,4,
