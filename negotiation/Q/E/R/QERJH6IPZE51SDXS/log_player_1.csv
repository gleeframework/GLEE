Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a special price of $119. I think it's a great deal and you'll find it valuable."", 
""product_price"": 119
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($80) as possible without going below your minimum ($120).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high allows room for Bob to counter-offer, potentially meeting somewhere in the middle. 
* **Alternative Buyer:** Knowing you have a guaranteed sale at $120 to John provides leverage. You're not desperate to sell below your minimum.

**Important Note:** There's a chance Bob might outright reject the offer. However, this strategy aims to maximize potential profit in case Bob is willing to negotiate or sees extra value not initially considered."
