"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. This is a significant discount from its true value, but I believe it's a fair price considering the benefits it can offer your business.  Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Alice,1,,

"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the market value and the benefits the product can bring to my business.",900000.0,Bob,2,,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer,
"Bob, I understand your perspective and appreciate your counteroffer.  However, $900,000 is still quite a bit below what I need to make this worthwhile.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000.  This is a fair price considering the value you'll gain from the product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",950000.0,Alice,3,,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer,920000.0
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I still think $920,000 is a bit too high. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $920,000 is a bit too high, I'm willing to meet you halfway at $920,000, but I can do better than that. I'm willing to go down to $920,000, but I think we can do better than that. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $915,000",915000.0,Bob,4,,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer,
"Bob, I see you're trying to meet me halfway, but $915,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little further to $930,000.  This is a significant discount from my initial asking price, but it's the best I can do.  If you're serious about purchasing the product, I think we can find a compromise at this price.",930000.0,Alice,5,,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer,910000.0
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $930,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $910,000, but I think we can do even better than that. I'm willing to go down to $910,000, but I'm hoping we can find a price that's even closer to what I'm comfortable with. I'm thinking $907,500",907500.0,Bob,6,,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer,
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your persistence. While $907,500 is closer to what I need, it's still not quite there.  I'm willing to come down to $920,000, which is a significant concession from my original price. I believe this is a fair offer considering the value you'll gain from the product. Let's close this deal.",920000.0,Alice,7,,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer,905000.0
"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm starting to think that we're getting close to a point where it's not worth continuing to negotiate. I'm willing to make one final offer of $905,000, and that's as low as I'm willing to go. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'm afraid I'll have to consider buying from John for $800,000.",905000.0,Bob,8,,
