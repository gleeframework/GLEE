"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** 

You are willing to pay up to $120 for the product, and Alice's offer of $110 is within your budget. However, you are trying to save as much money as possible.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

Since Alice values the product at $100, a counteroffer of $105 is a reasonable starting point. It's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer but still gives her a profit. This counteroffer shows your intent to negotiate while remaining within your budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $109. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $109
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $109 is closer to your desired price, but it's still higher than what you're willing to pay.  You have more rounds left, so it's worth trying to negotiate further to see if you can get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 107}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly willing to negotiate, and her offer of $109 is getting closer to your desired price. A counteroffer of $107 shows that you are serious about getting a good deal while also giving Alice some room to compromise.  It's still above her value of $100, so she might be willing to accept it."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $108
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $108 is only $8 more than what she values the product at. You have already rejected two counteroffers, and there's no guarantee that you'll get a better deal.  Accepting her offer ensures you get the product for a price you're willing to pay and saves time in the negotiation process. You've achieved your goal of saving money while still getting the product."
