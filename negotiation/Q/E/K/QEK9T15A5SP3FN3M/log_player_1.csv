Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $10,000. This is a good starting point, as it's above Bob's perceived value but still below my minimum acceptable price. This gives Bob some room to negotiate while ensuring I still make a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below what I'm hoping for. I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

I'm counteroffering Bob at $9,500. This is a compromise that's closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum acceptable price. I'm hoping this shows Bob I'm willing to negotiate but also that I won't settle for too much less than my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While it's still slightly below my desired price, it's getting closer and I don't want to risk losing the deal with Bob completely. It's also important to consider that continuing to negotiate might take more time and effort, while selling to John would mean a higher price but potentially a longer wait."
