"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I believe you'll find it to be a great addition to your collection. My initial offer for the product is $1,100,000.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, I'm working with a tighter budget. Would you consider $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand you're working with a tighter budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $800,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $950,000. This is my best price, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair deal.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  To be frank, $950,000 is a bit of a stretch for me right now.  Would you be open to $875,000?  That's a significant jump from my initial offer and demonstrates my seriousness about purchasing this product.",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable with $875,000. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to get closer to my target. I'm counteroffering at $925,000. This is a compromise that I think is fair, considering the product's value and your previous offers.",925000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're trying to reach your target price, and I respect that.  How about we settle this right now at $900,000?  That's a fair compromise, and we both walk away happy.",900000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad we're close to a deal. However, I'm still not quite there with $900,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target. I'm counteroffering at $920,000. This is my final concession, and I'm hoping we can wrap this up soon.",920000.0,Alice,7,
