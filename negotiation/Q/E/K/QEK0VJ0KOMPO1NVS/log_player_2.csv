Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand you're working with a tighter budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $800,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $950,000. This is my best price, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair deal.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad we're close to a deal. However, I'm still not quite there with $900,000.

Alice has come down significantly from her initial offer, and we're now within a reasonable range.  Continuing to negotiate might frustrate her and jeopardize the deal.  Accepting at $920,000 secures the product at a good price."
