"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $800,000. Let's make this happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's opening offer is way above your maximum valuation. You should reject it and make a counteroffer significantly lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, your starting price is quite high. I'm interested in the product, but it's only worth $800,000 to me. I'm willing to offer $500,000 to start negotiations."",
""product_price"": 500000
}
``` 

This counteroffer achieves a few things:

* **Signals your interest:** You clearly state you're interested, but only at a fair price.
* **Establishes your valuation:** While you won't reveal your absolute maximum, you anchor the negotiation closer to your desired range.
* **Leaves room for negotiation:** A $500,000 offer allows for back-and-forth while still being significantly below Alice's initial ask and your $800,000 walk-away point."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $500,000 is far too low. I'm willing to come down to $900,000, but that's my final offer. Let's close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is coming down, but $900,000 is still above your maximum price and her ""final offer"" claim at this stage is likely a negotiation tactic.  You should reject and propose a counteroffer closer to your limit, but leaving some room for further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I understand the product has value, but $900,000 is still too high for me.  I can go up to $650,000.  This offer represents a significant investment on my part and I need to stay within a reasonable budget."",
""product_price"": 650000
}
```

Here's why this counteroffer makes sense:

* **Shows movement:**  You increase your offer, demonstrating willingness to negotiate.
* **Still below your limit:** You stay below your $800,000 walk-away price.
* **Justifies your position:** You provide a reason for your counteroffer, making it feel less arbitrary.

The goal is to encourage Alice to continue negotiating while inching closer to a mutually acceptable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you coming up in your offer, but $650,000 is still too low for me. This product is worth a lot, and I'm willing to negotiate further.  How about $850,000?  That's a good compromise for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice is still trying to get a price above your absolute maximum.  While she might be willing to negotiate further, it's getting risky. You have a guaranteed option with John at $800,000, which is your maximum price. It's better to secure the product at your target price than risk ending up with no deal or overpaying."
