"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your starting price is quite high. I'm interested in the product, but it's only worth $800,000 to me. I'm willing to offer $500,000 to start negotiations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price.  I'll reject this and counter-offer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $500,000 is far too low. I'm willing to come down to $900,000, but that's my final offer. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the product has value, but $900,000 is still too high for me.  I can go up to $650,000.  This offer represents a significant investment on my part and I need to stay within a reasonable budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $650,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $650,000 is better than $500,000, it's still far below my minimum acceptable price. I need to keep pushing for a better deal, or go with John."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up in your offer, but $650,000 is still too low for me. This product is worth a lot, and I'm willing to negotiate further.  How about $850,000?  That's a good compromise for both of us."", ""product_price"": 850000}
