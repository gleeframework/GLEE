"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $200, which feels like a fair price for its value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $200 is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $100.
* It's worth exploring counteroffers to see if you can negotiate a better price. 
* You still have 9 rounds to make a deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice,  $200 is a bit more than I'm looking to spend right now.  I'm really interested in the product, but my budget is closer to $100. Would you be willing to consider that?"", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate you countering.  While $200 is my ideal price, I understand your budget constraints. Could you meet me halfway at $150? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the compromise. I'm still a little higher than I'd like to be.  How about we settle at $125? That's a good middle ground for both of us."", ""product_price"": 125}
