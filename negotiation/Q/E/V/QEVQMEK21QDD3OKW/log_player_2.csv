You can get the product for cheaper than $12,000, so rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer is the best strategy."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to spend a bit less, but I have to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $11,500.

You can still potentially get the product for a lower price than $11,500.  It's worth continuing to negotiate."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. How about $11,000? It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 11000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving money on the table. I can do $11,250, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250

Alice has made her final concession. While you might be able to get it down a bit more, the risk of losing the deal and having to buy from John at a much higher price is too high.  $11,250 is still a good price for you, saving you money compared to John."
