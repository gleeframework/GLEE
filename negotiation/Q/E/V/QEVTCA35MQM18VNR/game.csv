"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a competitive price, and I'm confident you'll find it hard to match elsewhere.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $900,000 is still above my initial budget. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product. This reflects its value to me and leaves some room for both of us to walk away with a good deal.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $750,000 is a significant discount, but I'm still not willing to let the product go at that price. Considering the value it holds for you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll counteroffer at $850,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's worth to you.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet halfway, but $850,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $825,000. This price reflects the value to me and provides a fair compromise for both of us. It's also a significant step closer to my initial offer.",825000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $825,000 is a significant compromise, Bob, but I'm still not willing to let the product go at that price. Considering the value it holds for you, I'm willing to make another concession. I'll counteroffer at $825,000 minus a small discount, which brings the price down to $812,500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's worth to you.",812500.0,Alice,5,
