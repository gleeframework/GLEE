"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm hoping to spend. How about $10,500?  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to save a bit, Bob. However, I've already invested a lot in this product, and I need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $11,500 for it. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $11,500 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's split the difference. How about $11,000?  I'm really hoping to close this deal today.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're really eager to close the deal, Bob, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for this product. I'm willing to compromise a bit more, but I need to get at least $11,250. I think that's a reasonable price considering the value this product brings. What do you think?",11250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $11,250 is still a bit out of my budget.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,125?  I'm really close to my limit, but I'd hate to miss out on this opportunity. ",11125.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand you're really close to your limit, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle. However, I'm not quite ready to give up yet. I'm willing to go a bit lower, but I need to get at least $11,200. I think that's a fair price considering the value this product brings. What do you think?",11200.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $11,200 is still a bit too high for me. I'm really close to my limit, but I'd hate to miss out on this opportunity.  How about $11,150? It's a small step closer to where I need to be, and I'm confident we can find a solution that works for both of us.",11150.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I understand you're really close to your limit, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. I'm willing to make one last concession. I'll sell the product to you for $11,200, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. If you're not comfortable with that, I'll have to consider other options. What do you think?",11200.0,Alice,9,
