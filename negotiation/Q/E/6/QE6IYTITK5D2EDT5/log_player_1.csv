Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering my product to you for $115. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it."", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:**  $115 is more than your minimum acceptable price of $100.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** $115 is below Bob's perceived value of $120, giving him room to counter-offer without feeling like he's getting a bad deal. 
* **It sets a strong initial price:** By starting higher, you create the opportunity for a better final price. 

However, be prepared to adjust your strategy based on Bob's response. If he rejects, you can then consider lowering your price a bit, but not too much, and keeping John's offer of $100 as a safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate it. I'm willing to pay $100 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is your minimum acceptable price, you have the opportunity to potentially get a better price. By rejecting Bob's offer, you can counter with a slightly lower price than your initial offer but still higher than Bob's offer, giving him some room to negotiate but maintaining your leverage."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your offer, but I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my original asking price.  I'm willing to come down to $110.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I am unable to go above $100 for the product. Would you consider meeting me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

It's time to cut your losses. Bob has shown he's unwilling to budge beyond $100, and further negotiation is unlikely to result in a higher price.  John is offering your minimum acceptable price, so selling to him is the best course of action to guarantee a sale and avoid further negotiations."
