"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $9,000 is tempting, it's a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little further to $10,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product for you, and it gives us both a good deal. What do you say?",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price. I'm still a bit hesitant at $10,500. I'd be willing to pay $9,800, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at that price?",9800.0,Bob,4,
