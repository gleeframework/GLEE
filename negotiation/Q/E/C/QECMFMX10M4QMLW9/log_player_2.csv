# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $1200000. This is a competitive price, considering its value to you is $1000000. I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment.

```

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While the product is worth $1,000,000 to Bob, Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is still too high. Bob can potentially get a better deal by negotiating with Alice or buying from John."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to find a mutually beneficial price. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1100000.

**Explanation:**

Bob should buy the product from John. While Alice has lowered her price to $1,125,000, it's still above what Bob is willing to pay. Since John is offering the product for $1,000,000, it makes more sense for Bob to buy it from him and avoid further negotiation with Alice."
