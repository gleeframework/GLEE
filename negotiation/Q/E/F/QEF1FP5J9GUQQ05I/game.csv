"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000. This is a great deal, considering the product is worth $800,000 to you, and I'm willing to make a concession to make this deal happen.",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm very interested in the product, but $950,000 is a little high for my budget. Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer of $700,000. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm afraid I can't accept that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. How about we try $825,000? That's a significant discount from my original offer, and I think it's a fair compromise.",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, $825,000 is still a bit above what I had in mind. Would you be willing to consider $760,000? I believe that's a fair offer that reflects the value I place on the product.",760000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $825,000 is still a bit above your target, and I appreciate your persistence. I'm willing to make another concession to try to meet you in the middle. How about we try $795,000? That's a significant discount from my original offer, and I think it's a fair compromise.",795000.0,Alice,5,
