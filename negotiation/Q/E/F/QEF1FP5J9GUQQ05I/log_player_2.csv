"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000. This is a great deal, considering the product is worth $800,000 to you, and I'm willing to make a concession to make this deal happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer of $700,000. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm afraid I can't accept that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. How about we try $825,000? That's a significant discount from my original offer, and I think it's a fair compromise.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $825,000 is still a bit above your target, and I appreciate your persistence. I'm willing to make another concession to try to meet you in the middle. How about we try $795,000? That's a significant discount from my original offer, and I think it's a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $795,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $795,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""
}
``` 

At this point, Alice's offer of $795,000 is still higher than John's offer of $800,000. It's unlikely Alice will go below this price, and continuing the negotiation carries the risk of Alice increasing her price or reaching an impasse.  Therefore, the best option is to buy from John at the guaranteed lower price."
