"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,100,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for this product.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $950,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is a fair price that recognizes the product's value to you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $1,050,000 is still a bit more than I can comfortably spend.  I'm happy to go up to $1,000,000. If you're not interested in that price, I can always go with John's offer.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
