"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000.  It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $12,000 to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob can get a better deal. While $10,000 is better than $12,000, Bob has room to negotiate and potentially save even more money.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and explore getting a price closer to Alice's value of $8,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. However, $10,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd be willing to pay $9,000 for the product. Let me know if you're open to that."", ""product_price"": 9000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I appreciate your interest. While I'm willing to negotiate, $9,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $9,500? This would still be a great deal for you, as you value the product at $12,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value:** Alice's offer of $9,500 is still within Bob's budget of $12,000, and significantly less than what he'd pay John. 
* **Negotiation:** While Bob could try to negotiate further, there's a risk Alice will reject another counteroffer.
* **Time and Effort:** Accepting Alice's offer saves time and effort compared to continuing to negotiate.

Ultimately, accepting this offer provides Bob with a good deal and avoids the risk of needing to buy from John at a higher price."
