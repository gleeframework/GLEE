"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential, I believe a starting price of $2,300,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",2300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to negotiate a better price. I'm willing to pay $1,800,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and our initial conversation.",1800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,800,000 is a significant investment, it doesn't reflect the true value of this product and its potential for you. I'm willing to come down to $2,100,000. This offer takes into account the unique benefits it offers and ensures a fair deal for both of us.",2100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, but I'm still not convinced that $2,100,000 is a fair price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,950,000 for the product. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the market value and our previous discussions.",1950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. Your offer shows you recognize the value of this product. To be frank, taking anything less than $2,000,000 would mean selling myself short.  Let's close this deal - I'm confident this product will exceed your expectations.",2000000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to go up to $1,900,000, but I think that's the maximum I can afford. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle and find a mutually beneficial price.",1900000.0,Bob,6,
