"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm asking for $95 for it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

``` 

The product is worth $80 to Alice, and she's offering it for $95. This means there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and get a better price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking for something closer to my original asking price. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $90? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:

``` 

While $90 is better than $95, it's still higher than what the product is worth to Alice.  You can likely get a better price by continuing to negotiate."

{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you want to get closer to your original price, but $90 is still a bit high for me. How about we split the difference at $87.50?  I'm serious about buying this product, and this is the best I can do."", ""product_price"": 87.5}
