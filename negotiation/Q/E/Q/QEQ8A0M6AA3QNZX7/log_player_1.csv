Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that you're interested in. My asking price is $110.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $100. This gives me some room to negotiate down if necessary.  I'm also keeping the message friendly and open to negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, I'm not willing to sell for $90 yet. I'll counter with a price closer to my original offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the counteroffer.  I appreciate you're interested.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $105 is the lowest I can go right now.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the counteroffer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $92.50. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While Bob is getting closer to my minimum, I'm not comfortable going lower than $100. Since I have a guaranteed buyer in John, it's in my best interest to sell to him and secure the $100."
