"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. While $11,000 is a better deal than buying from John, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to attempt to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $9,000. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a significantly lower counteroffer, aiming to quickly find a middle ground.  $9,000 is still a good deal for Bob, and it leaves room for Alice to counter without feeling like she's losing too much."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $9,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm happy to come down to $10,000. This would still be a great value for you, considering you value the product at $12,000. Let's meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $10,000, which is a good deal for Bob.  While he could continue negotiating, there's a risk that Alice will become less flexible, or he could run out of rounds and be forced to buy from John for $12,000.  Accepting the offer secures the product at a good price."
