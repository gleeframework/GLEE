,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a more reasonable price, but I'm afraid $500000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. How about we discuss a price of $900000?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet halfway, but I still believe that the product's value doesn't justify such a high price. Let's try $700000.",700000.0,Bob,4,
