"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd be very interested in.  I'm asking for $120 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's above my minimum ($80) but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  Offering $120 leaves a comfortable margin for Bob to counter without me feeling like I'm getting ripped off.
* **Friendly Tone:** I'm using a friendly and approachable tone to build rapport and make Bob feel comfortable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value Proposition:**  The product is worth $150 to Bob, and my minimum is $80.  $90 is closer to my minimum, but I can likely get a better deal.
* **Negotiation Strategy:**  Rejecting Bob's offer signals I'm not desperate and willing to continue negotiating.  This puts the pressure back on him.
* **Potential for Higher Price:** By rejecting, I can counteroffer and potentially push the price closer to my ideal outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. I'm happy to come down a bit, but $90 is a little too low for me.  How about $105?  That's still a great deal for you, and it's closer to what I need."", ""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offering Strategically:** I'm not just saying ""no"" to Bob's offer, I'm countering with a price that's closer to his offer but still within my desired range.
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to him ($150) and emphasizing the deal he's getting.
* **Maintaining Negotiation Control:**  I'm showing Bob that I'm willing to negotiate but not desperate to sell at his initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $105 is still a bit high for me. Can you meet me at $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Target:** $100 is very close to my desired price point, especially considering I'm already 4 rounds in. 
* **Risk of Stalemate:**  Continuing to negotiate could lead to a stalemate or a lower price.  It's risky to keep pushing when I'm already close to my target.
* **Opportunity Cost:**  There's a chance Bob could walk away or my other buyer (John) might become unavailable, so it's wise to secure a decent deal rather than risk losing out."
