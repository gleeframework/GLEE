"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this excellent product. I believe it will be incredibly beneficial for you. Given its value, I'm asking for $11,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $11,000 is less than the $12,000 John is asking, there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product,  $11,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $9,500.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but Realistic:**  This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial price, but it's not so low that it seems unreasonable or disrespectful. 
* **Leaves Room for Compromise:** There's still a gap between Bob's offer and Alice's desired price, allowing for further negotiation.
* **Reflects Value:** Bob's offer is still above Alice's minimum acceptable price, indicating that he recognizes the product's value."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but $9,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $10,250? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $10,250 is closer to Bob's goal, there's still room to bargain.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to counter again, potentially closing the gap further.  He's still saving money compared to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $10,250 is still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $9,875?  I believe this is a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9875}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Continues the Trend:** Bob is again offering a price that is closer to Alice's last offer, showing a willingness to compromise.
* **Fair Split:** The offer of $9,875 is almost exactly in the middle of Bob's last offer and Alice's last offer.
* **Still Below John's Price:** Bob is still getting a better deal than buying from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find a compromise.  While $9,875 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still looking for a bit more.  Would you consider $10,100? This offer reflects the true value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Difference:**  Alice's offer is only $225 higher than Bob's last counteroffer. 
* **Approaching Goal:**  This price is significantly closer to Bob's ideal price than buying from John. 
* **Risk of Stalemate:** If Bob rejects this offer, there's a risk of Alice becoming unwilling to negotiate further, potentially leading to Bob having to buy from John at a much higher price. 

While Bob could try to counteroffer again, the risk of losing the deal or having to buy from John at a higher price outweighs the potential for a slightly lower price."
