"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you highlighting the product's uniqueness. However, $12000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $9500 for it.  Let me know what you think.",9500.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12000 is a bit steep for you. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $9500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11000. It's still a great deal, considering the product's value and rarity. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference - I'll offer $10500 for the product.  I think this is a fair price considering both our positions.",10500.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $10500 is still a bit higher than your budget, Bob. However, I'm not willing to give up on the product's value just yet. I'm willing to make another concession and offer it to you for $10800. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's rarity and quality.
