"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a great product that I think you'll really like. I'm willing to offer it to you for $110. Is this something you'd be interested in? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Let's see if we can negotiate a better price with Alice first.  We have room to bargain before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $110 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider a lower price?"",
""product_price"": 80
}
``` 

This counter-offer starts the negotiation significantly lower than Alice's initial offer. This strategy aims to:

* **Gauge Alice's flexibility:**  Seeing how Alice responds will give us a better understanding of her bottom line. 
* **Leave room for negotiation:** Even if she rejects this offer, there's space to meet in the middle over subsequent rounds. 
* **Avoid going too high too early:** We don't want to show our hand and reveal our maximum budget right away."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. I can see if I can do better than $80. How about $95? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is moving in the right direction, but $95 is still above our target price. Let's continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice. Let's meet in the middle - how about $87?"",
""product_price"": 87
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the difference:** This counteroffer aims to find a compromise between Alice's $95 and our previous offer of $80.
* **Steady progress:** We're moving closer to a potential deal without making drastic jumps.
* **Maintaining pressure:** We're still signaling that we're looking for a price below $90."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not quite ready to meet in the middle just yet, Bob. How about we try $92? I think we can find a mutually beneficial price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is clearly trying to hold firm above $90.  We're getting close to our limit, but let's see if we can push her a little further before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""It seems like we're both trying to find a fair price, Alice. I'd be willing to go up to $89 if that works for you."",
""product_price"": 89
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Small increase:** We're signaling that we're willing to compromise, but only slightly. 
* **Testing the waters:** This offer will reveal if Alice is willing to settle below $90.
* **Approaching our limit:** We're getting closer to the point where John's offer might become more appealing."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I think we're getting close, Bob. I can see you're willing to meet me at $89, so I'll try to meet you halfway. How about $90? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Good deal secured:** Alice has come down to $90, which is a $30 savings from her initial offer and $10 below John's price. 
* **Limited time:** We're running out of rounds, and continuing to negotiate might not yield further significant reductions.
* **Risk vs. reward:**  While we might be able to get the price slightly lower, the potential savings are not worth the risk of Alice walking away or the time investment of further negotiation."
