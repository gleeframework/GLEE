"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $9,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you be willing to come down to $6,500?",6500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $6,500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $7,250?  That seems fair to both of us, don't you think?",7250.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand you can't go as low as $6,500.  How about we meet in the middle at $6,800? ",6800.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm willing to come down a bit further, but $6,800 is still a little too low for me. Let's try $7,000. It's a fair price that's closer to where I need to be, and I believe it's still a good deal for you.",7000.0,Alice,5,
