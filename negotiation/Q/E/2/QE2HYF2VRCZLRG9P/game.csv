"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1000000 is unfortunately too low for me.  The product's true value is significantly higher.  However, I'm willing to be flexible. I'd be happy to accept $1300000, which is still a great deal considering the product's potential.  Let's find a middle ground.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
