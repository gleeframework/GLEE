"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hey Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be interested in. It's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $90. This is a great deal, as I can easily sell it to someone else for $80. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

Alice is bluffing about easily selling it for $80.  You can try to get a better price. You're willing to pay up to $100 and John will sell it to you at that price, so you have some room to negotiate."
