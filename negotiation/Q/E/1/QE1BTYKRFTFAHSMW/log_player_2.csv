"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the product at a price of $1100000. It's a great deal for you, as the product is worth $1000000 to you. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is better than the product's value to Bob, it's still higher than what John is offering.  Since Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible, he should reject Alice's offer and buy from John for $1,000,000."
