"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $13,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd like to start with an offer of $10,000.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is quite a bit lower than I'm hoping for. How about we meet in the middle at $11,500?",11500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $11,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $11,000. I'm genuinely interested in this product, and I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.",11000.0,Bob,4,
