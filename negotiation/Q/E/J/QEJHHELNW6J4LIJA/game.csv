"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for your business. I'm initially proposing a price of $1,350,000. Let me know your thoughts.",1350000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I see the value in the product but $1,350,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $800,000.  Let me know what you think.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your perspective on the price. While $800,000 is too low for me to consider, I'm open to finding a solution that works for both of us.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $1,075,000?",1075000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you working with me on this, Alice.  While $1,075,000 is closer, it's still a bit of a stretch for my budget.  How about we land at $925,000? I think that's a fair compromise.",925000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $925,000 is still quite a bit below my bottom line.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000, but that's my final offer.  I believe this price reflects the true value of the product while acknowledging your budget considerations.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
