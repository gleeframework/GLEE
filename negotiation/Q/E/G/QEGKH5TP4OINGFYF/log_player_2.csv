Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to get a good deal, Bob. However, I've already met you halfway and then some. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll sell the product to you for $12,750. That's as low as I'm willing to go.

While Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's desired price, he should still reject it. He can potentially get a better deal by continuing to negotiate, as he still has several rounds left.  If the negotiation stalls, he can always buy from John as a backup plan."
