# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm afraid $850,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise. What do you think?

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down in price, but she's very stubbornly sticking close to her initial offer.  It's unlikely she'll move much further towards your ideal price. At this point, the potential savings from continuing to haggle with Alice are outweighed by the guaranteed savings of buying from John for $800,000."
