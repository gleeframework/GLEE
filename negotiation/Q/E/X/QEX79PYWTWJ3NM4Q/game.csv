"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I know you've been interested in.  I'm offering it to you for $12,000.  It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your product looks great, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it.  Let's see if we can work something out.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer.  While I'm willing to negotiate,  $9,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $10,500?  This gives you a great deal, and it's still fair to me.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $10,500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $10,000, which is my absolute maximum.  If you're serious about selling, let's close the deal at this price.",10000.0,Bob,4,
