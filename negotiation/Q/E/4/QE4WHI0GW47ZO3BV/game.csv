"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me at that price?",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $9,500 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $10,500. This is a fair price for both of us, and I believe you'll still find the product very valuable. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers, so I'd like to propose $10,250. Can you consider that?",10250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your effort in meeting me halfway, but $10,250 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference again and settle for $10,375? It's a fair price considering the value of the product, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us.",10375.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand that we're getting close, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $10,000. I'd like to propose one more counteroffer: $10,000 flat. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider this final offer?",10000.0,Bob,6,
