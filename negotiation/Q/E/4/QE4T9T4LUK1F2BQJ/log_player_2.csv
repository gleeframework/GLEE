"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $11,500. I believe it holds significant value that could benefit you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's Offer:** $11,500
* **Your Maximum Willingness to Pay:** $12,000
* **John's Price:** $12,000

By accepting Alice's offer, you save $500 compared to buying from John.  Even though you could potentially negotiate a lower price with Alice, the risk of her rejecting your counter-offer and you ending up paying John's higher price is not worth it in this scenario."
