"I'm willing to meet you at $12750 for the product, but I'd like to add a service package to the deal. This package is worth $250, but I'll only pay for the product itself.

"I appreciate your creative proposal, Bob. However, I'm not willing to accept the service package at no additional cost.

This way, you'll get the product and the service package for a total of $13100. This is a fair price considering the value I place on it.",13000.0,Alice,9,
