"I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're getting too far apart, Bob. I've already compromised significantly, and I'm not sure I can go any lower. However, I'm willing to make one final offer. I can do $16000, which is my absolute bottom line. If you're still interested, let me know.",16000.0,Alice,7,

"Bob, I'm disappointed that we couldn't meet in the middle, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $16000. However, I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal. I'll include a premium service package worth $1000, which will give you additional support and benefits. If you're still interested, I'll sell the product to you for $16000, and the service package is on the house. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,9,
