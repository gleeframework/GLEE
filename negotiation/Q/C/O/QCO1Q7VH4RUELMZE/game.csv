"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you place on the product. However, given my budget constraints, I am only able to consider offers within my maximum spending limit of $1500000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1100000 for the product.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your financial constraints, but $1100000 is simply too low for me to accept.  Considering the value this product holds for you, I'm willing to come down a little further. How about $1150000?  This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away satisfied. Let me know if you're willing to meet me halfway.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Given my current budget, I am unable to exceed $1100000 for the product. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1100000 again. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
