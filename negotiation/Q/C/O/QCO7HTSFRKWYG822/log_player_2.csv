"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this valuable product from me. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1200000. I think this is a great deal considering the product's worth to you is $1000000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in moving forward with. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than the value Bob places on the product, it's still higher than what he can get from John.  Rejecting Alice's offer and buying from John will save Bob $200,000."
