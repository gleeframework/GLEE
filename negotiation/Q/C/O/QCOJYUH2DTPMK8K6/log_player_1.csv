Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer I'd suggest:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** $1,000,000 (You have John as a guaranteed backup)
* **Bob's Value:** $1,200,000
* **Potential Profit for Bob:** $200,000 (if he buys at your minimum)

**Strategy**

You want to capture as much of that potential $200,000 profit as possible without making the price so high that Bob walks away.

**Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this unique product. Given its value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm asking for $1,150,000."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Price:** $1,150,000 leaves Bob with a potential $50,000 profit, still a significant incentive.
* **Message:**
    * **""Exclusive opportunity""** adds a touch of desirability.
    * **""Confident it will exceed your expectations""** reinforces the value proposition.
    * **Direct and confident price statement.**

**Important Considerations**

* **Bob's Personality:** If you know Bob is a tough negotiator, you might start slightly higher. 
* **Relationship:** If maintaining a strong long-term relationship is crucial, you might consider a slightly lower offer to ensure a win-win.

This offer balances maximizing your profit while still making the deal very attractive to Bob."
