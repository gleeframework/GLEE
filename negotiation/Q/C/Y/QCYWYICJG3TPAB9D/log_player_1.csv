{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a truly unique opportunity and I believe it holds significant value for you. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $700000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value you're offering. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While $700,000 is a decent offer, it's still below my minimum value of $800,000. I'll try to negotiate a better price with Bob before resorting to selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $700,000 is unfortunately below my minimum value.  I'm willing to come down slightly from my initial offer.  How about $900,000? This leaves room for both of us to be satisfied with the deal."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the revised offer. I understand that $900000 is a compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $850000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value you're offering. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $850,000 is above my minimum value of $800,000.  It's a good deal and worth accepting to avoid risking a lower price or having to sell to John."
