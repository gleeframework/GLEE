"Bob, I'm offering you the product for $950,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly less than its value to you and allows me to make a substantial profit. Let me know your thoughts.",950000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but $950,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $900,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $900,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $925,000. This gives us both a fair deal, and allows me to make a respectable profit. Let's close this deal.",925000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $925,000, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to go up to $920,000, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at that price?",920000.0,Bob,4,
