"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing product at a special price of $14,000. It's a great deal, and I think you'll love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is significantly higher than Bob's maximum budget of $10,000. It's wise for Bob to reject the offer and attempt to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested, $14,000 is above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Start with a reasonable counteroffer:**  Bob's offer is significantly lower than Alice's, but it's not a drastic drop. This shows a willingness to negotiate but also sets a firm limit.
* **Provide a reason:** Bob explains the reason for his counteroffer, which adds credibility and helps build a rapport. 
* **Leave room for negotiation:**  Bob has left some room for Alice to counter without immediately going to his absolute limit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. I can see you're willing to pay $10,500, but I was thinking more along the lines of $13,000. It's a fair price, considering the product's value and what I've seen in the market. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $13,000 is still higher than Bob's maximum budget of $10,000. While it's a decrease from her initial offer, it's still not within Bob's acceptable range.  Rejecting and counteroffering again gives Bob more leverage to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $13,000 is still outside my budget. I'm happy to meet you halfway at $11,500.  This price acknowledges the value of the product while still being within my financial constraints.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meet halfway:**  This counteroffer shows a willingness to compromise while still aiming for a lower price.
* **Reasoning:** Bob continues to explain his financial limitations and uses the ""meet halfway"" strategy to make the offer more appealing.
* **Keep some wiggle room:**  While $11,500 is closer to Bob's desired price, it leaves some room for further negotiations if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Bob, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,500. It's still a good deal for you, and it gets me closer to my target price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is coming down in price, $12,500 is still higher than Bob's maximum budget of $10,000. It's not a good deal for Bob, and he should keep negotiating to try and get a better price. Rejecting and counteroffering again gives Bob more leverage to try and get Alice closer to his target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I see we're getting closer. However, $12,500 is still beyond my budget.  Let's split the difference and go with $11,000. This would be a fair deal for both of us, and I'm confident we can finalize this transaction. What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Split the difference:** This strategy is often effective in negotiations, showing a willingness to compromise while still moving closer to Bob's desired price.
* **Emphasis on fairness:**  Bob highlights that this price would be a ""fair deal"" for both parties, appealing to Alice's sense of equity.
* **Confidence in finalization:**  By stating he's confident they can finalize the deal, Bob creates a sense of urgency and encourages Alice to accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not willing to go as low as $11,000, Bob. I think we can meet in the middle again at $12,000. It's the lowest I can go, and I'm confident you'll love the product at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $12,000 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $10,000. With only a few rounds left, the negotiation isn't progressing quickly enough to get Alice to Bob's desired price. Since John is offering the product for $10,000, it makes more sense for Bob to cut his losses and buy the product from John. This ensures he gets the product at his desired price without risking further negotiation rounds that might not yield a favorable outcome."
