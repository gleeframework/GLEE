"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $14000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $11500 for it. What do you think?",11500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $11500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13000. This price still gives you a great value for the product, and it's a fair price for me. Let's make this happen.",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  However, $13000 is still a little higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $12500.  This would be a good deal for both of us, and I'd like to make this happen.",12500.0,Bob,4,
