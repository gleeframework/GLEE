Alice's offer is way above your budget. It's worth trying to negotiate with her first."

I'm starting with a significantly lower offer, aiming for a substantial discount. This is a bold move, but it's necessary to push Alice towards a more reasonable price point."

Alice's offer is still too high.  While it's closer to my budget, I'm going to try to push for a lower price by making another counteroffer."

I'm raising my offer slightly to $850,000. This is a significant improvement on my previous counteroffer, showing Alice that I am serious about buying the product.  However, it's still within my budget and leaves room for further negotiation.  I'm hoping this will be close enough to her desired price that she'll accept."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

Alice's offer is still significantly higher than what I'm willing to pay.  While I could continue to negotiate, it's clear that she's not willing to budge much.  I'm going to accept the offer from John and purchase the product for $800,000. This is the most sensible option as it guarantees me the product within my budget."
