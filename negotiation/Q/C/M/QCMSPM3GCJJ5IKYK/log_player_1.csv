{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a fantastic deal, and I believe it's worth every penny. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer starts with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, giving me some room to negotiate.  It also includes a friendly message to encourage Bob to consider the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I really like the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to make a deal, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $9,000 is better than nothing, it's below my minimum threshold of $10,000. I'm going to counteroffer and see if I can reach a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. I understand your budget constraints, but $9,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,500, which is still a great deal considering the value of this product. Let's find a middle ground, what do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $10,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to meet you halfway at $10,250. That's the highest I can go, but I'm really interested in the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 

While I would prefer to sell for more, Bob's offer of $10,250 is above my minimum threshold of $10,000. It's also a reasonable compromise, and I'm confident I can still make a good profit on this sale."
