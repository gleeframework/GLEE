Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, making this your ""walk-away"" price.
* **Bob's Value:**  The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob, meaning he wouldn't rationally pay more.
* **Negotiation Space:** There's a potential negotiation space between $1,200,000 and $1,500,000.

**Strategy**

The key is to offer a price attractive enough to Bob while maximizing your potential gain. Here's one approach:

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm offering it to you for $1,450,000.  I believe this represents a fair deal considering the benefits you'll reap."",
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **High Starting Point:** This offer starts closer to your minimum acceptable price but leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. 
* **Value Emphasis:**  The message highlights the ""unique value"" to entice Bob and justify the price.
* **""Fair Deal"" Language:**  Framing the offer as ""fair"" aims to make Bob feel like he's getting a reasonable deal, even though it's significantly above his perceived value.

**Important Note:**  Negotiation is dynamic. Be prepared for Bob to counter-offer or reject your initial proposal. If he does, you can decide whether to negotiate further or proceed with John."
