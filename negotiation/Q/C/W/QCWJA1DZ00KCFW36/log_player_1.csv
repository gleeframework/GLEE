Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1000000}

While $750,000 is a decent amount, it's still below my minimum threshold of $800,000. I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}

I'm lowering my price slightly to $900,000.  This is still a significant profit for me, and it shows a willingness to negotiate. Hopefully, Bob will see this as a good deal and accept."
