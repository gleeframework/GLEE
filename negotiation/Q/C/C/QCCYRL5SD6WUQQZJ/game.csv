"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am currently working within a budget that doesn't allow for such a high price. Would you consider reducing the price to $1,600,000? I believe this might be a fair compromise.",1600000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer. While I'm willing to negotiate, $1,600,000 is still slightly below my desired range. I'm prepared to lower the price to $1,650,000. This is a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it reflects a fair value for this unique product. What do you think?",1650000.0,Alice,3,
