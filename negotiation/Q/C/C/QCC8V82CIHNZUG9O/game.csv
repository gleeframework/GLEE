"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this amazing product with you! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $18,000. This is a great deal, considering its worth $12,000 to you. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $18,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $13,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",13000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $18,000 might be a bit steep for you. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $16,000. This is a compromise that I think is fair, considering its worth $12,000 to you. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $16,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $13,000.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",13000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're sticking to your original offer, Bob. However, I'm not willing to sell the product for $13,000, as it's still below my minimum price. I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'll sell the product to you for $14,500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering its worth $12,000 to you. What do you think?",14500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $14,500 is still a bit high for me. How about we split the difference and I pay $13,750? That would be a fair compromise for both of us.",13750.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground, Bob, but I'm not willing to accept $13,750. I've already compromised a lot, and I need to make sure I get a decent profit. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer: I'll sell the product to you for $14,000. This is my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",14000.0,Alice,7,
