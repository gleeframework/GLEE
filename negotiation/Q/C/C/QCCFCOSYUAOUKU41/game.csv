"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that will bring significant value to your business. I'm willing to start with an offer of $950,000. What are your thoughts?",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I see the value in this product, $950,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to offer $850,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit, so I'll offer you the product for $900,000. This is my final offer in this range, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your need to make a profit, and I'm willing to be fair.  However, $900,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm prepared to offer $875,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",875000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I can see you're serious about acquiring this product, and I'm willing to meet you at $875,000. However, I still need to make a profit, so I'll make a small adjustment. I'll offer you the product for $912,500. This is a compromise that should work for both of us.",912500.0,Alice,5,
