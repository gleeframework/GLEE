,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $10,000 for it. What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your position, but $10,000 is significantly lower than what I had in mind. How about we meet in the middle at $17,000?",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet in the middle, but $17,000 is still a bit high for my budget. I could potentially do $12,000. Would that work for you?",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  Let's try to wrap this up quickly. How about $15,500?  This is a very fair offer considering the value you're getting.",15500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. It's getting close, but I'm really trying to stay closer to $14,000. If you're willing to come down a bit more, I think we can make a deal.",14000.0,Bob,6,
