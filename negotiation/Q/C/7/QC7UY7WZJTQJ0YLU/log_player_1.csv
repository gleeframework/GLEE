"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,600,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations."", 
""product_price"": 1600000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting significantly higher than both my minimum ($1,200,000) and Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000). This allows room for negotiation and creates the perception that the product might be worth even more than Bob initially thought.
* **Leaving John as Backup:** While I have a guaranteed offer from John, getting a deal closer to my asking price is preferable. I can leverage John's offer later in the negotiation if needed.
* **Positive Tone:** Setting a collaborative and positive tone is important for a successful negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I recognize the product's value, your initial price is quite high for me. I'd be willing to start the negotiation at $800,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly below both my minimum and his own stated value of the product. While his counter-offer was expected, accepting $800,000 would be a substantial loss. I'm confident I can negotiate a much better deal. I'll counter in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counter-offer. I understand your perspective, but $800,000 is significantly below the product's true value. To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000. This reflects the product's worth while also acknowledging your interest."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** I'm making a significant concession of $200,000 from my initial offer to demonstrate willingness to negotiate and find a compromise. 
* **Staying Firm:** However, I'm still holding firm well above both my minimum and Bob's initial offer. This keeps the negotiation alive while aiming for a price closer to my target. 
* **Justification:** I'm reiterating the product's value to justify the higher price and prevent Bob from anchoring too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1,400,000 is still too high for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Profitable Deal:** Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is above my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. Accepting ensures a profit.
* **Negotiation Progress:** Bob has significantly increased his offer from $800,000, indicating a strong interest in the product. 
* **Time Value:**  Continuing to negotiate might yield a slightly higher price, but there's also the risk of Bob lowering his offer or stalling. Accepting now secures the deal and avoids potential losses from prolonged negotiations."
