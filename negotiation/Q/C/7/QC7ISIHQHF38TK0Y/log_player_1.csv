Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. It's a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a good profit. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:** $900,000 is higher than the $800,000 Bob values the product at, giving him an incentive to negotiate. 
* **It's below my minimum value:**  $900,000 is still above my minimum of $1,000,000, so I'm not giving it away.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** There's space for Bob to make a counteroffer, allowing us to find a mutually agreeable price. 

This approach balances maximizing profit with maintaining a potential deal with Bob.  If Bob rejects, I can then consider John's offer or make a counter-offer to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the price of $900,000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $850,000. This still allows for a reasonable profit for you while keeping within my financial limits. Please let me know if this is acceptable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $850,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum desired value of $1,000,000.  I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, as there's still potential for a deal that's more beneficial to me. 

By rejecting Bob's offer and making a counteroffer, I can explore the possibility of a price closer to my desired range. This approach keeps the negotiation open and avoids a premature decision that could result in a significantly lower sale price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $850,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $875,000? This would allow me to make a reasonable profit while still giving you a good deal. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 875000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Balancing my needs:** $875,000 is still above my minimum value but closer to Bob's offer, showing willingness to negotiate.
* **Maintaining leverage:**  By not accepting his initial offer, I demonstrate that I'm not desperate and am confident in the product's value. 
* **Positive framing:**  The message emphasizes a ""meeting halfway"" approach, highlighting the potential for a win-win situation. 

This counteroffer aims to find a compromise while remaining firm on my desire for a price closer to my desired range. It also sets the stage for further negotiation if Bob needs more time to consider."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I must stick to my budget. I am willing to pay up to $860,000 for the product. This still provides a decent profit for you while allowing me to stay within my financial limits. I hope this proposal is acceptable to you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $860,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $860,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's final offer of $860,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  Although further negotiation might be possible, I'm  not confident that I can push him to a price that meets my minimum value.

Therefore, I'm choosing to sell the product to John for $1,000,000. This ensures I achieve my minimum profit goal and avoids the risk of further negotiation with Bob, which could result in a lower selling price."
