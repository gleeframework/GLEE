"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $20000.  It's a great deal and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know what you think!",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $20000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $18000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",18000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you're looking for a good deal. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $18000 is still too low for me. How about $19000? It's a fair price considering the value of the product.",19000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but $19000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $17000, which is the maximum I'm willing to go. Can you meet me at this price?",17000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating with you, but $17000 is unfortunately still below my minimum.  I'm willing to go down to $18000.  Let's meet in the middle. What do you say?",18000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to a deal, but $18000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $16500. Can you meet me at this price?",16500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $16500 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and come down to $17500.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product and our ongoing negotiation.  Let's close this deal.",17500.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
I'm willing to pay $16000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering our previous offers and the value I believe the product has. Can you meet me at this price?,16000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, we've been going back and forth for a while now, and I'm starting to think we might not be able to agree on a price.  I'm willing to make one final concession and come down to $16500.  If you're serious about buying the product, this is the best I can do.  Let me know your decision.",16500.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your concession, but I'm still not comfortable with $16500. I'm willing to pay $15500 for the product. This is my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider buying from John for $12000.",15500.0,Bob,10,
