Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd find valuable. I'm willing to offer it to you for $95.  Let me know if you're interested!"",
""product_price"": 95
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to $100 as possible.
* **Bob's Valuation:**  Knowing Bob values the product at $80 gives us some room to negotiate above that price.
* **Alternative Buyer:** The presence of John willing to pay $100 provides a strong fallback position.

By offering the product at $95, Alice aims for a price that is:

* **Attractive to Bob:** It's significantly lower than his perceived value.
* **Profitable for Alice:** It's a substantial profit margin, almost maximizing what she can get.

If Bob rejects the offer, Alice doesn't lose out as she has John as a guaranteed buyer."
