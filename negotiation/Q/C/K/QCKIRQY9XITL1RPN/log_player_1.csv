Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe would be of great value to you.  I'm offering it to you for $20,000. It's a unique opportunity, and I'm confident you'll find it beneficial. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 20000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. This gives me room to negotiate and allows me to gauge Bob's interest.
* **Positive Framing:** The message is friendly and emphasizes the potential value of the product to Bob.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message includes a call to action, inviting Bob to respond and potentially begin a negotiation.

This strategy balances the need to earn as much as possible with the risk of losing the deal if the price is too high.  We'll see how Bob responds and adjust our approach accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice!  $20000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending right now.  I'd be willing to pay $17000 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, but still not ideal.**  I'm not desperate to sell, and I believe I can potentially get closer to my desired price.
* **I want to see if I can push for a better deal.**  By rejecting his offer, I can make a counteroffer and explore if there's more room for negotiation.

I'm not comfortable selling to John yet, as I'm still hopeful I can get a better price from Bob.  The next round will involve making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer. While $17,000 is closer to what I was hoping for, I'm still a bit hesitant to sell at that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $18,500.  This would be a fair price for both of us, and I believe you'll still get great value from the product.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 18500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:**  I'm making a counteroffer that's halfway between Bob's offer and my desired price. This shows flexibility while still trying to maximize my earnings.
* **Positive Framing:** The message is still friendly and focuses on the potential benefits for both of us. 
* **Call to Action:**  I encourage Bob to respond to my counteroffer and continue the negotiation. 

This strategy aims to find a middle ground while keeping the negotiation open. It's a balanced approach that considers both the value of the product and the potential for a successful deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $18500 is still a bit high for my budget. How about we split the difference at $17750?  This would be a fair deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll still get a good price for your product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $17,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $17,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Close to my minimum:** Bob's offer is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Risk of losing the deal:**  If I reject this offer and try to push for a higher price, there's a strong chance Bob will walk away entirely.  
* **Time is money:** Continuing to negotiate could drag the process out, potentially leading to delays and uncertainty.

At this point, the potential gain from further negotiation is not worth the risk of losing the deal altogether.  Accepting Bob's offer secures a sale at a price that's close to my minimum, ensuring I still make a decent profit."
