"Hi Alice, $20,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm really interested in the product, but my budget is $8,000. Would you be willing to come down to that price?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $20,000 is my initial asking price, I understand that might be high for your budget. Could you consider $16,000?  I'm motivated to find a good home for this product.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $16,000 is still a bit higher than I can afford right now.  I'm ready to pay $10,000, which is the highest I can go. Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for the offer and your honesty about your budget.  I'm very motivated to sell, but $10,000 is quite a bit below what I need to make this work. Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $13,000?  This would be my final offer.",13000.0,Alice,5,
