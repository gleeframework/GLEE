Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you a fantastic opportunity to purchase a unique product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000.  I believe this represents a fair deal considering the significant benefit it offers you."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  While we know Bob values the product at $1,200,000, we want to secure the highest possible price. Starting with a strong offer close to his perceived value increases the chances of a quick and profitable sale. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Offering $1,100,000 leaves some room for Bob to potentially negotiate, but still ensures a substantial profit margin above your minimum acceptable price ($800,000).
* **Alternative Buyer:**  Having John as a backup buyer at $800,000 gives you leverage. If Bob rejects the initial offer, you're not losing out completely. 

This strategy balances maximizing your potential profit with the risk of Bob rejecting the offer."
