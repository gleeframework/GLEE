"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you a fantastic opportunity to purchase a unique product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000.  I believe this represents a fair deal considering the significant benefit it offers you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is higher than your maximum budget of $1,200,000, but it's still a better deal than buying from John for $1,200,000.
* By rejecting Alice's offer, you might be able to negotiate a lower price. Alice is motivated to sell, and you represent a sure sale compared to the uncertainty of finding another buyer. 

**Strategy:**

You should attempt to negotiate with Alice to get the price closer to $1,000,000."
