Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $110. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting with a price of $110, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Message:**  I'm being friendly and positive, emphasizing the value of the product and leaving the door open for negotiation. 

**Strategy:**

* **High initial offer:** This sets a baseline and allows for potential concessions later on. 
* **Positive messaging:**  A friendly tone encourages Bob to engage in the negotiation.
* **Flexibility:** I'm prepared to make counteroffers if Bob rejects my initial offer.

**Note:** This is just my initial offer. The best strategy will depend on how Bob responds and the dynamics of the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within a certain budget. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* While $90 is closer to my minimum value of $100, I still have leverage. Bob is clearly interested in the product and I believe I can get a better price. 

**Next Steps:**

I will reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer but lower than $110. This will show that I'm willing to negotiate, but also that I value the product highly."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your budget constraints. I'm willing to come down to $105.  This is still a good deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 105}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm lowering the price to $105, which is still above Bob's initial offer but closer to his budget and my minimum value.
* **Message:** I'm acknowledging Bob's budget concerns while emphasizing the value of the product and the fairness of my offer. 
* **Negotiation:** This counteroffer shows that I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm not giving in entirely.

**Strategy:**

* **Moderate concession:** This shows flexibility without compromising too much. 
* **Positive framing:**  The message focuses on the benefits for Bob, highlighting the ""good deal.""
* **Continued negotiation:** This keeps the dialogue open and allows for further potential concessions.

**Note:**  My next move will depend on Bob's response to this counteroffer. If he's still hesitant, I might consider lowering the price slightly again, but I'll be mindful of my minimum value of $100."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make another offer of $95. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my means. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $95 is only $5 away from my minimum value of $100. While I'm tempted to continue negotiating, I'm concerned that:

* **Time:**  Further negotiation could be time-consuming and might not guarantee a better price.
* **Risk:** There's no guarantee that Bob will accept a higher counteroffer, and I could end up with less than my minimum value.

**Strategy:**

Selling to John for $100 is a safe and secure option. It guarantees my minimum value and avoids the risk of further negotiation. 

**Conclusion:**

Although I could potentially negotiate further with Bob, I'm choosing the more certain option of selling to John. This ensures I reach my minimum value and saves me time and potential risk."
