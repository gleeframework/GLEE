"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. That price is a bit high for me right now. I'm interested in the product, but I'm working with a budget of around $6,000. Would that be something you'd consider?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest and your offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $6,000 is significantly below its true value. To make this work, I could come down to $11,500. This feels like a fair compromise.",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving a bit on the price.  I'm getting closer, but $11,500 is still a stretch for me.  How about $7,500?  That's a reasonable offer that would allow me to stay within my budget.",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. While $7,500 is closer, it's still below what I can accept. How about we meet in the middle at $9,500? This is my final offer, as I have another interested buyer.",9500.0,Alice,5,
