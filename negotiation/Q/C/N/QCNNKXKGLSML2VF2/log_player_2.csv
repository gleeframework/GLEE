# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the product at a price of $1,100,000. I think it's a great value and I'm confident you'll love it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above your maximum budget of $1,000,000.  You can get the same product from John for a lower price."
