"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling this incredible product to you. I think it's a game-changer and I believe you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value to you is $1,200,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit steep for me. How about we meet in the middle at $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $750,000 is a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm willing to compromise. I can do $850,000, which is still a great deal considering the product's true value to you. It's a 12.5% discount from my original offer, and I think it's a fair price considering the benefits the product will bring to your business.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  While I see the value in the product, I can't justify going above $800,000.  That's my final offer.",800000.0,Bob,4,
