Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I think it could really benefit you. I'm asking for $20,000, which reflects the true value of what you'll be gaining."", ""product_price"": 20000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $20,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,000, which is a fair price considering my needs and the value I see in the product. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum. While I want to make a deal, I'm better off seeing if I can negotiate him up or going with John.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you making an offer.  I understand your perspective on the value, but to be honest, $10,000 is quite a bit lower than I can accept.  How about we meet in the middle at $17,000? I'm confident you'll see a significant return on this investment."", ""product_price"": 17000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your need to make a profit, but $17,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $12,000, which is a more reasonable price point for me and still allows you to make a decent margin. Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
