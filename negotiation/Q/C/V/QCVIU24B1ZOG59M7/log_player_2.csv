"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I think it could really benefit you. I'm asking for $20,000, which reflects the true value of what you'll be gaining. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

Alice's offer of $20,000 is far above your maximum budget of $10,000. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $20,000 is significantly higher than my budget.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you making an offer.  I understand your perspective on the value, but to be honest, $10,000 is quite a bit lower than I can accept.  How about we meet in the middle at $17,000? I'm confident you'll see a significant return on this investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $17,000 is closer to your budget, it's still above your comfort zone.  It's worth continuing to negotiate to see if you can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your need to make a profit, but $17,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $12,000, which is a more reasonable price point for me and still allows you to make a decent margin. Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 12000}
