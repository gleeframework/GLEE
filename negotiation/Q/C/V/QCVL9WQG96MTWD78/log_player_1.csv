Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $11,500. I believe it will be highly beneficial to you, and this price reflects its true value."", ""product_price"": 11500} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Bob values the product at $12,000, so there's room to negotiate above your minimum price ($8,000).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high at $11,500 allows room for Bob to counter-offer while still ensuring you're significantly above your fallback price. 
* **Confident Approach:**  The message highlights the product's value and positions the price as fair, making it more likely for Bob to accept. 

**Alternatives:**

You could start with a slightly lower price (e.g., $11,000) to increase the chances of an immediate acceptance. However, the current approach aims to maximize your potential earnings."
