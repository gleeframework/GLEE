"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product at a special price. I think you'll really love it! I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,000. Let me know if that sounds good to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, it's still above your maximum price point of $10,000. You can still save $1,000 by rejecting Alice's offer and buying from John."
