"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's always a good idea to see if you can get a better price, even if it's just a little bit. Since you have 10 rounds, rejecting the first offer and seeing if Alice will come down a bit is the best first step."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

Starting with a significant discount (20%) is a good strategy to gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate. If she accepts, you've saved a substantial amount. If she rejects, you have more room to maneuver in subsequent rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice has come down a bit, but it's still not as low as you'd like. There's still room to negotiate, and you have more rounds left. It's worth trying to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

You're aiming for a middle ground between your previous offer and Alice's latest one.  This counteroffer shows you're willing to compromise while still pushing for a price closer to your target."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice is coming down in price, and with only 5 rounds left, it's a good idea to lock in this price. You're saving $800 compared to John's offer, and it's unlikely you'll be able to negotiate a significantly lower price in the remaining rounds."
