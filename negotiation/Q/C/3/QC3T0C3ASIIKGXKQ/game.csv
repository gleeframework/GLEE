"I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to purchase a high-value product. I believe you'll find it to be a great investment. Would you like to make an offer on the product for $12,000?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for your offer, Alice. I'm very interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $10,500?",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob. However, I've invested a lot in this product and I need to make a profit. I can do $11,500, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. Would you be interested?",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you working with me, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $11,000? That's a fair deal for both of us.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, Bob, but I still need to make a profit. I can do $11,500, but I'm willing to compromise a bit. How about we meet at $11,750? It's still a great deal for you, and it's a bit closer to my target price.",11750.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm seeing a pattern here that's not encouraging.  I'm willing to bump my offer slightly to $11,200, but that's absolutely my limit.  If this doesn't work, I'll have to go with John, even though I'd rather work with you.",11200.0,Bob,6,
