"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $12,000 is better than $15,000, Bob can likely get a better deal by negotiating.  There's no need to rush into a decision.  Rejecting the offer allows for further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a significant discount.  Starting with a counteroffer of $9,000 is a bold move, but it shows Alice that Bob is serious about getting a good deal. This counteroffer leaves room for negotiation while still staying within Bob's budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $11,000 is closer to Bob's ideal price, it's still above his maximum budget.  There's still room for negotiation, and it's worth seeing if Alice will come down further. If she won't, Bob has the option of purchasing from John.  Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation open."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is now getting closer to his budget limit.  Offering $10,500 shows willingness to compromise while still aiming for a price that's reasonable for him. This counteroffer is a good middle ground that may be appealing to Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $10,800 is just slightly over Bob's budget, there's still room for negotiation, and it's worth seeing if Alice will go lower.  If she won't, Bob can always buy from John.  Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation open and gives Bob more leverage."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10250}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting closer to his limit.  Offering $10,250 shows commitment to reaching a deal while still trying to save as much as possible.  It's a strong counteroffer that may convince Alice to accept. If she doesn't, Bob can still buy from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,600
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

At this point, it's highly likely that Alice won't go lower than $10,600.  Bob has two choices:

* **Accept the offer:**  This saves Bob $400 compared to buying from John, making it a good deal.
* **Reject the offer and counteroffer:** This risks Alice walking away, leaving Bob with only the option to buy from John.

Considering the risk, accepting Alice's offer is the best option to secure the product while still getting a good price.  It's a sensible choice given the limited rounds remaining."
