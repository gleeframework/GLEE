"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $950,000 is a bit too low for me.  I understand we need to find a price that works for both of us, so I'm willing to come down slightly. I'm proposing a counteroffer of $1,100,000. This reflects the value of the product and allows for some room for negotiation. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
