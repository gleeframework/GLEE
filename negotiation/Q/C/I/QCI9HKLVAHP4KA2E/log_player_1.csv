Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the product for $11,999. This is a fantastic deal on a product I know you're interested in."", 
""product_price"": 11999
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as much money from Bob as possible before resorting to John's guaranteed $12,000 offer. 
* **High Anchor:** Starting with a price just below John's offer creates a strong anchor point.  While it's higher than Bob's perceived value, it sets the expectation that this is a premium item.
* **Urgency (Implied):** By not explicitly mentioning John, there's an implicit sense of urgency â€“ Bob doesn't know there's another buyer waiting.

This strategy aims to capitalize on Bob's potential desire for the product while leaving room for some negotiation."
