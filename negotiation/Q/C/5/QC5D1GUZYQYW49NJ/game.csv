"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $950000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I can't go above $800000. This is the maximum price I'm willing to pay. Please let me know your thoughts.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $920000 is a step closer, I'm still unable to go above my initial offer of $800000. It's my maximum budget for this purchase.  Let me know if you're willing to consider my offer. ",800000.0,Bob,4,
