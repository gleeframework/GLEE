Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that's worth a lot to me. I'm willing to let it go for $100.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's higher than Bob's valuation, but lower than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation without immediately alienating Bob. It also demonstrates that you are willing to compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of the product is high to you, but I believe I can offer a fair price of $90 for it. Please let me know if this is acceptable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $90 is closer to your minimum than Bob's initial valuation, it's still below your floor price. You have a solid alternative with John, so rejecting the offer and counter-offering is the best strategy to potentially secure a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to let go of the product for that price.  How about we split the difference at $95?  That would be a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 95} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I think $90 is a fair price considering the value of the product to me. However, I am open to discussing other terms if that helps reach an agreement. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob has made it clear he's unwilling to go above $90.  While you could continue to counter-offer,  you're approaching your minimum price. It's unlikely you'll get a higher price from Bob, and you have a guaranteed sale to John at $120.  Therefore, selling to John is the most profitable option."
