"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-value item at a competitive price. My initial offer is $1400000 for the product. I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While Alice's offer is better than John's, it's still above Bob's maximum budget.  By rejecting, Bob can try to negotiate a lower price."

Round 2

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm hoping to get a price closer to my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:** Bob begins with a counteroffer that's still significantly lower than Alice's offer, but higher than John's price.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're looking to stay within your budget, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1250000. My next offer is $1350000 for the product. I believe this price is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

* **Negotiation Opportunity:** There's still room to negotiate further. Bob can try to get Alice closer to his target price.  
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Buying from John would secure the product at a lower price, but Bob might be able to get an even better deal by continuing to negotiate with Alice."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down in price.  Let's split the difference - $1,300,000. I'm confident this price would be fair for both of us, and it gets us closer to a deal."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** This counteroffer shows Bob is willing to meet Alice halfway, demonstrating his desire to reach an agreement.

* **Risk of Overpaying:** Accepting Alice's offer would mean paying more than Bob's target price. 
* **Potential for Better Deal:** By continuing to negotiate, Bob might be able to secure a lower price.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I understand your need to get a fair price for this product, and I'm trying to be fair to both of us. How about we meet in the middle at $1,310,000? This would be a good compromise that allows us both to walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 1310000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway (Again):**  Bob proposes a price that's directly in between his previous offer and Alice's latest offer. This shows a continued willingness to compromise and reach a deal.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, Bob. However, I'm still a bit short of my target. My next offer is $1320500 for the product. I'm trying to find a price that works for both of us, and I think this is a good compromise. Let's see if we can make it work. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,320,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,320,500

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Target, but Not Quite:** Alice's offer is very close to Bob's ideal price, but it's still a bit above his target.
* **Time is Running Out:** With only three rounds left, the risk of not getting a better deal is increasing. 
* **Guaranteed Savings:**  Buying from John guarantees a purchase within budget, while continuing to negotiate with Alice carries the risk of going over budget or running out of time.  
* **Minimizing Risk:** Given the limited time and the possibility of Alice not budging further, it's safer and more strategic to secure the product from John."
