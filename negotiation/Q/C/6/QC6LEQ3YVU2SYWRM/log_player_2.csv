"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is too high. Since your maximum budget is $1,500,000 and you want to save as much money as possible, rejecting the offer and counter-offering is the best strategy. You can likely get a lower price by negotiating further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can reach a deal."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but I can't go as low as $1,300,000.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,350,000?  It's still a good deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,350,000 is a good compromise and still within your budget.  While you could continue negotiating, there's a risk of Alice rejecting further counteroffers and potentially pushing the price closer to John's $1,500,000. Accepting Alice's offer saves you $150,000 compared to buying from John."
