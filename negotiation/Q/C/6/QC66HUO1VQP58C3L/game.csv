"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As a starting point, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,000,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value is $1,200,000 to you.",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm definitely interested in the product, but I'm working with a tighter budget. Would you consider $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $800,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. How about we discuss a price of $950,000? It's a compromise that still benefits both of us.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  To be totally transparent, $900,000 is really the top end of what I can justify. If you're willing to work with that, I'm ready to close the deal.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $900,000 is your top end, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to give up too much profit. I'm willing to go up to $925,000, but that's as high as I can go. It's still a great deal for you, considering the product's true value to you is $1,200,000.",925000.0,Alice,5,
