"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $9,500 is a bit higher than I'm looking to spend. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it. Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob. However, I've got to make a profit on this deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $9,000 for the product. Can you consider that?",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $9,000 is still a bit high for me.  Let's split the difference - I'm willing to pay $8,750.  This gives us both a fair deal.",8750.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to consider your offer, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $8,750. I'll give you a slight discount, but I need to get at least $9,200 for the product. Can you think about that?",9200.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I'm still interested in the product, but I'm not sure I can go higher than $8,800. This price is fair for both of us and allows me to make the purchase.  What do you say?",8800.0,Bob,6,

"I'm glad you're still interested, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $8,800, but I'd like to throw in a sweetener to sweeten the deal. I'll include a one-year warranty and a free maintenance package, which is a $500 value. If you're willing to pay $8,800, I'll give you this package for free. What do you think?",8000.0,Alice,7,
