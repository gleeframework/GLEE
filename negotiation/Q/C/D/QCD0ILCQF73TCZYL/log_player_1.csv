Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. It's a unique opportunity to acquire a valuable asset at a fair price.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $900,000, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  By starting high, I create space to potentially lower the price and reach a mutually beneficial agreement.
* **Focus on Value:** My message highlights the product's value and presents the offer as a fair deal. 

**Strategy:**

This strategy aims to:

* **Maximize my earnings:**  I'm targeting a price closer to my minimum value while still leaving space for negotiation.
* **Gauge Bob's interest:**  Bob's response will reveal his willingness to pay and inform my next steps.
* **Maintain leverage:** By having John as a backup buyer, I can walk away from the deal if Bob's counteroffers become unreasonable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time and consideration, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the market value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $750,000 is significantly below my minimum value of $1,000,000 and even below his own perceived value of $800,000.  Accepting this would be a significant loss.
* **Opportunity for Counteroffer:**  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to control the negotiation and make a counteroffer that is more favorable.
* **Leveraging John's Offer:** I still have the option of selling to John for $1,000,000, which gives me a strong fallback position.

**Next Steps:**

* I will make a counteroffer to Bob that is closer to my minimum value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* My counteroffer will be higher than $750,000 but lower than my initial offer of $900,000. This demonstrates flexibility while still protecting my interests."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $750,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about we settle on $850,000? It's a price that reflects the value of the product while allowing us both to walk away satisfied."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer Strategy:** I'm offering $850,000, which is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's. This shows flexibility while still aiming for a price closer to my minimum value.
* **Emphasize Value:** My message emphasizes the value of the product and frames the counteroffer as a win-win solution.
* **Setting a Limit:** While I'm willing to negotiate, my offer makes it clear that I'm not willing to go much lower than $850,000. 

**Next Steps:**

* I will observe Bob's reaction to this counteroffer. 
* If he accepts, I've achieved a favorable outcome.
* If he rejects, I'll need to carefully consider my next move, keeping in mind John's offer of $1,000,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $850,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'm thinking $775,000. I believe this price is fair and reasonable, and I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $775,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:**  $775,000 is still significantly below my minimum value of $1,000,000. Accepting this offer would result in a substantial financial loss.
* **Negotiating Room:** While Bob is showing a willingness to compromise, there is still room for further negotiation.  
* **Leveraging John's Offer:**  I can walk away from this deal and still secure a better price from John, giving me strong leverage.

**Next Steps:**

* **Counteroffer:** I will make a counteroffer to Bob that is higher than his $775,000 but lower than my previous offer of $850,000. This shows flexibility while staying closer to my minimum value. 
* **Potential Deal Breaker:** If Bob's next counteroffer doesn't get closer to my minimum, I may decide to sell to John, ensuring I don't lose too much money."
