"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it has the potential to greatly benefit your business and I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob can likely get a better deal than $900,000. Since Alice values the product at $800,000, there's room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially save more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to spend a bit less.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $850,000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $875,000. It's a fair price considering the value it brings to your business. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price significantly, making her offer very attractive. Buying from Alice for $875,000 saves Bob a substantial amount of money compared to buying from John for $1,000,000. While there's still potential to negotiate further, the risk of Alice rejecting a lower counteroffer and Bob ultimately needing to pay John's higher price is too great. Accepting Alice's offer ensures a good deal and finalizes the purchase."
