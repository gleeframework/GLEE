Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that you've shown interest in. I'm asking for $12,000 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $12,000, which is higher than Bob's perceived value of $10,000. This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Not too high:** It's also lower than my minimum value of $15,000. This keeps the negotiation open and prevents Bob from walking away immediately.
* **Friendly Tone:** The message is friendly and invites Bob to discuss the offer, making him more likely to engage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $9,000 is far below my minimum value of $15,000.  
* **Potential for counteroffer:** I'm confident I can get a better price than $9,000 by counteroffering. I'm willing to negotiate, but not at such a steep discount.
* **John as an alternative:** Having John as an alternative buyer gives me leverage. I know I can always secure $15,000 if the negotiation with Bob fails."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I appreciate your interest in the product. While $9,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $11,000. It's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer Strategy:**  I'm starting my counteroffer slightly closer to Bob's offer, showing a willingness to negotiate. 
* **Reasonable Price:**  $11,000 is still above Bob's offer but closer to his perceived value, making it more likely he'll consider it.
* **Maintaining Value:** I'm staying above my minimum value of $15,000, ensuring I don't lose too much.
* **Friendly Tone:** The message maintains a friendly tone, encouraging further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the revised offer. I understand that $11,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $10,500. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** While it's closer to my minimum value, $10,500 is still significantly lower than what I'm aiming for.
* **John as a safety net:** I have the option of selling to John for $15,000, which is a much better deal.
* **Potential for higher counteroffer:** I believe I can still push for a higher price by making a counteroffer. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I'm not settling for a price that's too far below my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate you coming up to $10,500. To be honest, I'm still a bit away from where I need to be to sell. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, how about $10,750? It's a fair price considering the product's value and my willingness to negotiate. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10750}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway Again:**  I'm demonstrating a willingness to negotiate by offering a price that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's current offer. This shows flexibility.
* **Close to Minimum Value:** $10,750 is still slightly below my minimum value, but it's getting closer. This might encourage Bob to accept, but I'm still not giving up too much.
* **Friendly Tone:** I'm maintaining a friendly tone, encouraging Bob to continue the negotiation.
* **Potential for Acceptance:** Bob has already shown a willingness to compromise, so there's a good chance he might accept this offer."
