{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value. This gives me room to negotiate down if necessary, but also shows I'm not desperate to sell for the minimum. I'm also being positive and emphasizing the value of the product to encourage a positive response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of your product, but I am only willing to pay up to $12,000 for it. Could we possibly come to an agreement at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $12,000 is the minimum I'm willing to accept, I'm not desperate to sell right away. I want to see if I can get closer to my asking price.  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand your position. However, I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my initial asking price.  Would you be willing to pay $12,500? It's still a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find the product to be well worth it."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```

I'm going to counter with $12,500. This is a compromise, but it's still a little higher than Bob's offer. I'm hoping that he sees the value in the product and is willing to meet me halfway. I'm also reinforcing the idea that it's a good deal for him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to counter with a price of $12,000 for the product. This aligns closely with my budget and I believe it's a fair price given the value of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This time I'm going to accept Bob's offer. We've been going back and forth, and I'm happy to take $12,000. It's the minimum I'm willing to sell for, and I'm not sure how much longer I want to keep negotiating.  I don't want to risk losing Bob as a buyer and having to sell to John for the same price."
