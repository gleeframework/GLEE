{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

This offer allows for some negotiation room, but it still leaves you with a profit significantly higher than your minimum.  The offer also opens the conversation by acknowledging the product's value to Bob, potentially leading to a smoother negotiation process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. I'm willing to offer $1200000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to you, and I'm confident it's a good deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,200,000 is a decent amount, it's still significantly lower than my desired profit margin and even lower than the price John is willing to pay.  Rejecting this offer allows me to counter with a higher price and hopefully reach a more favorable agreement with Bob, or potentially move on to John if negotiations with Bob stall."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This offer still gives you a substantial value for the product and allows me to secure a fair price. Let's meet in the middle and close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
