Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I believe is really valuable to you. I'm offering it to you for $95. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 95}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's slightly above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Friendly Tone:**  I'm using a friendly and inviting tone to make Bob feel comfortable with the negotiation process.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** By starting at $95, I have room to negotiate down if Bob counters.
* **Always the Option of John:** I know I can get $100 from John, so I'm not desperate to sell to Bob at a low price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am looking to keep my spending within a certain budget. I would like to propose a price of $80 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  $80 is below my minimum acceptable price of $100. 
* **Negotiation is Possible:**  Bob has shown interest and is willing to negotiate.  
* **Potential for a Higher Price:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I can attempt to get closer to my desired price in the next round.

I will counteroffer Bob to try to get a price closer to my $100 minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer, but $80 is a bit too low for me. I understand your budget, but I'm willing to come down to $90.  It's a fair price considering the value of this product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a compromise by coming down from my initial offer but still staying above Bob's price.
* **Emphasis on Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to justify the price.
* **Open to Discussion:** I'm leaving room for further negotiation by asking for Bob's opinion. 
* **Moving Closer to Target:** This counteroffer gets me closer to my goal of $100."
