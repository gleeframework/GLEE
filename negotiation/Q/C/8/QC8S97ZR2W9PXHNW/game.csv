"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about $16,000? This is still a great deal for you, and it's the lowest I can go. Let me know your thoughts.",16000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still interested in the product, but $16,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $14,000? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",14000.0,Bob,4,
