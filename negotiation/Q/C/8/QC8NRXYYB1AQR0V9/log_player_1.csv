"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,500,000. This is a strong opening position that allows for potential negotiation down the line.  It's important to gauge Bob's reaction and adjust my strategy based on his response. If he rejects, I'll need to consider his counteroffer and whether it's worth continuing negotiations or moving on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is far too low. While I want to close the deal, selling for $800,000 is a significant loss for me.  I'll reject his offer and counter with a more reasonable price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

I'm counteroffering with $1,200,000. This is my floor price -  the minimum I'm willing to accept. It's also the price John is willing to pay, so I have a solid fallback option if negotiations fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low, though it is getting closer. I'll reject his offer and continue negotiating to see if we can reach a price closer to my desired amount."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $1,100,000. This is a significant concession from my previous offer, showing willingness to compromise while still remaining above my minimum price. I believe this offer is attractive to Bob, considering his previous offer, and gives us a good chance of reaching an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,000,000 is getting closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable amount. I believe there's still room for negotiation, and I'm willing to risk another round to see if we can reach a better agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

I'm counteroffering with $1,050,000. This is a small compromise from my previous offer, and it's a good compromise given Bob's increasing willingness to pay.  This could be the final price we settle on, or if Bob is still hesitant, we can potentially negotiate a little more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

We've reached the 8th round, and Bob's offer remains at $1,000,000.  While it's tempting to keep negotiating, I've reached my limit with Bob. I'm confident that I can secure the guaranteed $1,200,000 from John, and it's time to stop the negotiations with Bob."
