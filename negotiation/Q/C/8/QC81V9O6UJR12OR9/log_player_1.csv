Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of your product, $2000000 is slightly above my budget. I'd be interested in purchasing if we could reach an agreement closer to $1500000.  I believe this would be a fair price for both of us and would allow me to move forward with this purchase. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
