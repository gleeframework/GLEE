"Bob, I understand your perspective, but I'm not able to go as low as $1,200,000.  I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000. This reflects a significant discount from my original offer and still allows me to make a fair profit.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $1,180,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to compromise a bit further and offer the product for $1,220,000. This is a fair price considering the value you place on the product and allows me to make a reasonable profit.  Let's see if we can finally strike a deal.",1220000.0,Alice,5,
