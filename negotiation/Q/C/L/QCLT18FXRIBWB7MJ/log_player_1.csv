This offer is slightly above Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation. It also signals my willingness to be flexible and find a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I think it's a bit too high. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

While $1,200,000 is a decent price, I'm still aiming for a higher amount. I'm confident that I can push for a better deal with Bob, given his interest in the product."

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but I'm not able to go as low as $1,200,000.  I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000.

Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still not willing to sell for that low. I believe there's still room for negotiation and I'm confident I can secure a better price."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $1,180,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to compromise a bit further and offer the product for $1,220,000.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still below my minimum threshold.  At this point, the negotiation is taking too long, and it's clear that reaching a mutually agreeable price with Bob is going to be difficult. It's better to sell to John and get the guaranteed $1,500,000."
