"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this valuable product from me. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's worth to you is $1,500,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for our negotiation. What are your thoughts?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit high for me.  Would you consider a price closer to $650,000?",650000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still looking to get a good return on my investment. Considering your offer of $650,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $775,000. This is a compromise that I hope we can both agree on. What do you think?",775000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get closer to your target, but I'm still not willing to go below $800,000. Considering your offer of $700,000, I'm willing to compromise again. I'm counteroffering at $725,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go. What do you think?",725000.0,Alice,5,
