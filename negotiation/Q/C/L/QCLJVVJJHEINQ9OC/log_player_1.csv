Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $10,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable value of $8,000, but it gives me room to negotiate. I want to see if Bob is truly interested and if so, how much he's willing to pay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $9,000 is closer to my minimum, I still think I can get more. I'll counter with a lower price than my initial offer but still above my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

I'm offering $9,500. This is a compromise, but it still allows me to get closer to my ideal price. I'm hoping that Bob will see this as a reasonable offer and accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

At this point, Bob has shown that he's willing to pay close to my minimum acceptable price. I don't want to risk losing him and having to settle for John's offer, which is significantly lower. $9,200 is a good deal, and I'll accept it."
