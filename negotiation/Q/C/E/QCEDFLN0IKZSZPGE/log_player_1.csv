Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. It's a great deal for both of us! Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

This offer gives me a significant profit while still leaving room for negotiation if Bob is willing to counter.  If he rejects, I can always go with John for the $10,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $13,000 is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $11,000.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $11,000 is better than John's offer, I believe I can still get closer to my desired price.  I'll counter with a slightly lower price to see if we can reach a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $11,000 is still a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $12,000? I think that's a fair price that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 12000} 
```"
