"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the potential in this product, $2500000 is more than my budget allows. I'd be willing to purchase it for $1500000. This is a fair price considering my budget and the need to make this a worthwhile investment for both of us.",1500000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1500000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $2000000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and uniqueness. What do you think?",2000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, $2000000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $1750000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and my budget limitations. Let's try to reach an agreement.",1750000.0,Bob,4,
