Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic opportunity to purchase a product that I know you'll find incredibly valuable.  Given its worth, I'm proposing a price of $13,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its value, especially to someone like you. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 13000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since Bob values the product significantly higher than our minimum and John's offer, we start high to maximize potential profit.
* **Justification:**  The message subtly hints at the product's high value to Bob, justifying the price without revealing our hand completely. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** The offer leaves room for Bob to negotiate down, potentially landing us somewhere above our minimum. 

This approach aims to secure the highest possible price from Bob while still making the offer attractive enough for him to accept."
