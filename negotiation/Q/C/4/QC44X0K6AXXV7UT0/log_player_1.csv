Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 14000} 
```

This offer gives Bob a good deal, as he values the product at $15,000. It also leaves room for potential negotiation if he is not happy with the price, while still ensuring I receive a profit of $2,000, exceeding my minimum requirement of $12,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer meets my minimum requirement, I believe I can still secure a better price. By rejecting his offer, I can try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}

I'm offering Bob a slightly lower price than my initial offer, but still higher than his counteroffer. This shows flexibility while maintaining a profit margin above my minimum requirement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Bob's offer of $13,000 is close to my desired price, and is higher than John's offer.  It's a good compromise, and secures a profit above my minimum requirement."
