Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $140 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $155? Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 155}

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I've done some research and found out that the product is worth $150 to you, which means you're not willing to go below that. Considering that, I'd like to offer you $147 for the product. This way, you're getting closer to your valuation while staying within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $147. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $147
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
