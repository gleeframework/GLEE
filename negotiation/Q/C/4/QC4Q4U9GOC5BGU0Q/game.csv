"I appreciate your confidence in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,150,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me.",1150000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, while I understand your perspective, $1,150,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000, which is still a fair price considering the value you've placed on the product.  Let's find a compromise that works for both of us.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,250,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,200,000, which is the price I was initially considering when I had the option to buy from John. I think this is a fair price considering the value I've placed on the product.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
