Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $9,500 is still a bit higher than what I'm comfortable paying.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. This is a fair price, considering the value it holds for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500.
