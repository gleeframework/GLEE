"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I am offering you our premium product for $9,500. This is a high-quality item that I believe would be valuable to you, given its worth of $8,000 to you. I hope we can come to an agreement that satisfies both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above your maximum budget of $8,000. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price with Alice before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $9,500 is still a bit higher than what I'm comfortable paying.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. This is a fair price, considering the value it holds for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 8500}
