"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,250,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as you get a valuable product at a good price and I can still get a decent return. Let me know your thoughts!",1250000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,250,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. This is a fair price that would allow both of us to benefit from the deal. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,050,000 is still not a price I can accept.  I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000, which reflects the value of the product while allowing for a fair deal for both of us. This is my final offer. Let me know if you're interested.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,150,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000, which is a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away with a good deal. I'm confident we can reach an agreement at this price.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
