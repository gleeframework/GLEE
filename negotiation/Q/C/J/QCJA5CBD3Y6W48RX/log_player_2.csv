"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,250,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as you get a valuable product at a good price and I can still get a decent return. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above your maximum budget. You can likely get a better deal by negotiating further.  Rejecting the offer allows you to counter-offer and potentially secure a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1,050,000 is still not a price I can accept.  I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000, which reflects the value of the product while allowing for a fair deal for both of us. This is my final offer. Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,150,000 is still higher than your maximum budget of $1,000,000. However, it's closer to your target price, and it's possible you can negotiate her down further.  Rejecting her offer allows you to counter-offer again, aiming to get closer to your desired price."
