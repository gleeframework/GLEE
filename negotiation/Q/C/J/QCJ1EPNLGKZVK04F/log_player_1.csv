"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $2,000,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value, but it gives me room to negotiate if Bob counteroffers. I believe this is a good starting point to gauge Bob's interest and potential willingness to pay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my minimum value, I believe I can still get a better price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1900000}
```

I'm countering with $1,900,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. It shows I'm willing to negotiate but still want to earn a good amount for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. It's only $50,000 less than my previous counteroffer, and it's well above my minimum value of $1,500,000.  It's not worth risking further negotiation with Bob when I can secure a good price."
