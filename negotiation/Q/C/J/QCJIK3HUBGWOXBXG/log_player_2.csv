Alice's offer:

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm still not comfortable with $75. It's simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference at $85? I'm trying to be fair here, and I think this price is a good compromise.

Alice is unlikely to go below $85.  It's better to buy from John for $80 and avoid further back and forth."
