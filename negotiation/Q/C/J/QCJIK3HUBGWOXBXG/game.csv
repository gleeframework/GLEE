"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $110 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $65?",65.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $65 is too far below what I'm able to accept.  How about we meet in the middle at $90? I'm confident this price will still give you a good value for the product.",90.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your position, Alice.  How about $75? That's a fair compromise, I think.",75.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm still not comfortable with $75. It's simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference at $85? I'm trying to be fair here, and I think this price is a good compromise.",85.0,Alice,5,
