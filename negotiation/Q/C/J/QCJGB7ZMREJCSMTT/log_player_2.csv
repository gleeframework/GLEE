# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,800,000.  I believe this reflects its true worth and the value it can bring you.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is significantly higher than my maximum budget of $1,200,000. It's best to reject this offer and start negotiating.  I'll likely need to counter with a much lower price."

# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you countering and recognizing the value of this product. While $1,200,000 is below my initial asking price, I'm willing to be flexible to reach a deal. How about we meet in the middle at $1,500,000?

While Alice has come down from her initial price, $1,500,000 is still above my maximum budget. I'm not comfortable paying that much. I'll counteroffer again, aiming to get closer to my target price."
