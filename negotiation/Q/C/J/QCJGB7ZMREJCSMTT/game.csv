"Alice, your initial offer is quite high. I'm very interested in this product, but my budget is limited to $1,200,000.  I'm willing to pay that amount if you're open to negotiation. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you countering and recognizing the value of this product. While $1,200,000 is below my initial asking price, I'm willing to be flexible to reach a deal. How about we meet in the middle at $1,500,000?",1500000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,500,000 is still a bit high for me. Given my budget constraints, I can only offer $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the potential of the product and the fact that we're both eager to reach a deal. Let's see if we can close this gap.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
