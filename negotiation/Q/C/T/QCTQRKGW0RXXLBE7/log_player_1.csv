Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Considering its value, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's $1,500,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $1,400,000 leaves some space for Bob to potentially negotiate down, but still ensures a significant profit above your $1,200,000 minimum.
* **John as a Backup:** Knowing you have a guaranteed sale with John at $1,200,000 gives you leverage. You don't *need* to go below that price."
