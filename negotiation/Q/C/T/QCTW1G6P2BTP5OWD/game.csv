"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to acquire a product that holds significant value for your business. I understand its worth to you is $1000000.  While I value the product highly myself, I'm willing to start with a price of $900000. I believe this is a fair starting point for both of us. What are your thoughts?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $700000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me is $1000000, and I'm willing to make a compromise to get a deal done.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $700000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down slightly from my initial offer. How about $850000?  This would still leave a significant margin for you while ensuring I receive a fair price for the product.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $850000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers, so how about $775000? I think this is a fair price that works for both of us.",775000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $775000 is closer, it's still not quite there for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again, and offer $812500.  This would allow me to get closer to my minimum price while still providing you with a significant discount from your initial value of $1000000. What do you think?",812500.0,Alice,5,

"I understand you're trying to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get closer to $750000. How about $785000? I think this is a fair price that works for both of us.",785000.0,Bob,6,
