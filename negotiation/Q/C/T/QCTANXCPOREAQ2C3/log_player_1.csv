Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000.  It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $15,000 to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's significantly higher than your minimum:** $12,000 is well above your $8,000 minimum, giving you room to negotiate.
* **It's attractive to Bob:**  Bob values the product at $15,000, so $12,000 is a good deal for him. 
* **It leaves room for counteroffers:** You can still increase the price if Bob is willing to pay more.

Remember, you can always walk away and sell to John for $8,000 if Bob doesn't accept a price you're happy with."
