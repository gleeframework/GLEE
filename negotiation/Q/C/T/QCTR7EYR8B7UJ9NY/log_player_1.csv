Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $120.  I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations a bit higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob counter-offers.
* **Limited Time:**  Creating a sense of urgency might encourage Bob to act quickly and accept the offer. 
* **Value Emphasis:** While not explicitly stating Bob's perceived value, the message hints that the product is worth the asking price. 

This strategy aims to maximize profit while still offering a price reasonable enough for Bob to potentially accept."
