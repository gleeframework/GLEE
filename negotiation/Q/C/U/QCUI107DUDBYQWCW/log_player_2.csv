"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $110 is within Bob's budget, it's still more than he's willing to pay. It's better to reject the offer and see if a lower price is possible in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is willing to pay up to $120, so starting with a counteroffer of $105 is a reasonable compromise. This offers Alice a decent price while still giving Bob room to negotiate further if necessary."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $115 is still higher than Bob's target price.  Since there are still rounds left, Bob can continue to try and negotiate a lower price.  It's still better to reject and try again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has already offered $105, and Alice came back with $115, so a compromise at $110 seems like a good next step. This is still within Bob's budget and could be accepted by Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $117.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $117.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $117.5 is getting closer to Bob's maximum price, but it's still above his target. With only 5 rounds left, the chances of negotiating a lower price are diminishing. At this point, buying from John for $120 provides a guaranteed deal within Bob's budget and avoids the risk of further negotiation with Alice."
