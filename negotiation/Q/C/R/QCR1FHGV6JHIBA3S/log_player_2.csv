"Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $120 is less than the $150 John is asking, you can still potentially save more money by negotiating with Alice.  You are willing to pay up to $150, so you have room to make a counteroffer that benefits both of you."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering Alice $100 for the product. This is a significant discount from her initial offer of $120, but it's still within my budget of $150. This counteroffer gives Alice a chance to make a profit while still allowing me to save a substantial amount of money."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $110 is a good compromise. It's lower than her initial offer but still allows her to make a profit.  It's also significantly lower than John's price of $150, so it's the best option for me to save money.  While I could continue negotiating, there's a risk that Alice will reject my next counteroffer, and I'll be stuck with John's higher price."
