"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest and counter-offer.  While I understand your perspective on the price, I believe this product is worth more than that, especially considering the value it will bring you.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,500?",13500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to pay $13,500. I'm willing to go up to $12,800, but that's as high as I can go. Can you consider my revised offer?",12800.0,Bob,4,
