Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a possible offer Alice could make:

```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $11,500.  I believe this is a fair offer considering its worth to both of us. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 11500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Value:** Alice knows Bob values the product at $12,000, giving her leverage in the negotiation.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While starting high, the $11,500 offer leaves some room for Bob to potentially counter-offer, increasing Alice's potential profit.
* **Creating Urgency:**  Mentioning a public listing implies scarcity and encourages Bob to decide quickly to secure the deal.
* **Justification:** Highlighting the ""fairness"" of the price aims to make Bob feel comfortable with the offer.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Risk Tolerance:** This strategy involves a slight risk. If Bob rejects the offer, Alice will have to settle for $10,000 from John. 
* **Relationship:**  If Alice values a long-term relationship with Bob, she might consider a slightly lower opening offer to foster goodwill."
