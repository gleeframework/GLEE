"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $9,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $8,500. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,000, which is a fair price for both of us.  Let's meet in the middle!",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $9,000. However, I'm still looking to spend closer to $8,500.  Perhaps we can split the difference and settle on $8,750?  It's a fair price for both of us.",8750.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I'm happy to work with you. However,  $8,750 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $8,900, which is a fair compromise.  Let's make this happen!",8900.0,Alice,5,
