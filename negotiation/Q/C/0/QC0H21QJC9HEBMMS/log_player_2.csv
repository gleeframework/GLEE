"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to acquire this valuable product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a deal that will benefit both of us. I'm offering the product to you for $1400000. This is a competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better offer elsewhere. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","I'm not convinced that $1,400,000 is a competitive price. I can get it for $1,200,000 from John, so I'll reject Alice's offer.
