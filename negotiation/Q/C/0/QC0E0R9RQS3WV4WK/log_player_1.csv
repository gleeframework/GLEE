"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product with you. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially offering it at $2,300,000. I'm open to hearing your thoughts on this."",
""product_price"": 2300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** We begin significantly higher than both Bob's perceived value and your minimum acceptable price. This provides room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest.
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes ""unique value and potential,"" subtly justifying the high price without revealing your hand.
* **Openness:** Expressing openness to Bob's thoughts encourages him to engage in the negotiation.

This strategy aims to:

1. **Anchor high:**  People tend to fixate on the first number presented, even if it's unrealistic. 
2. **Gather information:** Bob's reaction to this initial offer will provide valuable insights into his negotiation style and how badly he wants the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. That price is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $800,000 for it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly below both your minimum acceptable price and even his own perceived value.  While his message suggests some flexibility, accepting $800,000 would be a substantial loss. It's crucial to demonstrate that you won't settle for such a low amount. We'll counter with a more reasonable offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  However, $800,000 significantly undervalues the product's true potential. I'm willing to come down to $2,100,000. This reflects the value I know this product holds for any serious buyer."",
""product_price"": 2100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Conciliatory but Firm:** We acknowledge Bob's counteroffer but remain firm that it's too low.
* **Strategic Concession:** We make a significant price reduction ($200,000) to show flexibility and encourage Bob to negotiate seriously. 
* **Value Reiteration:**  The message subtly reinforces the product's value to keep Bob engaged. 

This counteroffer aims to:

1. **Establish a realistic baseline:** We're still above Bob's perceived value but moving closer to a potentially agreeable range.
2. **Test Bob's seriousness:**  His response will indicate whether he's truly interested or just aiming for an unrealistically low price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the value this product represents, but that price is still outside my budget.  I can go up to $950,000.  This is a fair offer considering I could go with another seller. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer has increased, it's still significantly below your minimum acceptable price. His attempt to introduce pressure by mentioning ""another seller"" is likely a negotiating tactic.  We need to hold firm and continue demonstrating that we understand the product's worth. Rejecting this offer keeps the negotiation open while allowing us to gauge his true willingness to meet closer to your price range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm sensing some hesitation on your end.  Let's be transparent.  I've already received a standing offer of $1,500,000 from another buyer. However, I value our initial discussions and believe we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This is my final offer."",
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Introducing Scarcity and Value:** By revealing John's offer, we establish scarcity (someone else wants the product) and reinforce your minimum acceptable price.
* **Finality and Urgency:**  Stating this is your final offer creates urgency for Bob to make a serious decision.
* **Slight Concession:**  We're still making a small concession to demonstrate continued interest in a deal.

This tactic aims to:

1. **Push Bob towards a decision:** He needs to decide if he's willing to meet you closer to your price or risk losing the product.
2. **Maintain a strong position:** We're not giving in to lowball offers while demonstrating a genuine desire to close a fair deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, knowing you have another offer at $1,500,000 makes $1,900,000 hard to accept.  I can do $1,100,000, but that's my absolute best. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

It's time to walk away from the negotiation with Bob and accept John's offer. Here's why:

* **Stalled Progress:** Despite revealing your bottom line and creating urgency, Bob's offer is still significantly below your minimum. He's made it clear that $1,100,000 is his ""absolute best,"" indicating he's unlikely to move much higher.
* **Opportunity Cost:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob risks losing John's offer.  Every round spent with Bob is a round where John could change his mind.
* **Guaranteed Value:** John's offer provides a guaranteed $1,500,000, meeting your minimum acceptable price and eliminating the uncertainty of further negotiation. 

While you could try to extract a slightly higher price from Bob, the potential gain is outweighed by the risk of losing a guaranteed, acceptable offer from John."
