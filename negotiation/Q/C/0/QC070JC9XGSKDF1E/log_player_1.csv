"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer of $15,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price of $12,000, leaving room for negotiation. I want to see if Bob is truly interested and what his perceived value of the product is."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While $12,000 is my minimum acceptable price, I believe I can get a higher price through continued negotiation. I want to see if Bob is willing to budge from his offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
```

I'm offering $13,500 as a counteroffer. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still above my minimum acceptable price. I hope this demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a profitable sale."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not comfortable selling at that price.  There are still rounds left, and I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500}
```

I'm offering $12,500. I'm now getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, but I believe there's still room for negotiation. I want to see if Bob will meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm choosing to sell the product to John for $12,000.  The negotiations with Bob have reached a point where the offers are getting too close to my minimum acceptable price, and the risk of further rounds resulting in a lower price isn't worth it.  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum and saves time."
