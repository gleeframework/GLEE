You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your maximum budget of $1,200,000.  It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice to see if you can get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer starts the negotiation process. By offering $1,000,000, I'm significantly below Alice's initial price, but still within a range that might be acceptable to her, especially if she's motivated to sell. This initial counteroffer gives me room to adjust based on Alice's response."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down in price, it's still higher than my maximum budget.  I'll continue negotiating with Alice to see if I can get a price closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering my maximum price of $1,200,000.  This is a significant compromise from my previous offer, and it's likely to be a strong incentive for Alice to accept. If she rejects it, I'll have no choice but to buy from John."
