Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $12,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json

I'll reject Bob's offer. $10,000 is too low, and I can still negotiate with him or sell to John for a better price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $10,000 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $11,000.

Round 4
Bob's offer:

I'll reject Bob's offer. While $10,500 is closer to my desired price, I'm still hoping to get a bit more. I'll try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
