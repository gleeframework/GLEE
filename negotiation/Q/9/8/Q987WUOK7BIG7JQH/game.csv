"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to own this valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its worth to you is $1,200,000.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,400,000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000, which reflects the value I see in the product.  I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us, considering your estimated worth of $1,500,000.",1250000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,250,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,325,000. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you and my original asking price.",1325000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,325,000 is still beyond my budget. I'm confident that $1,300,000 is a fair price that reflects the value of the product for both of us. It's a significant compromise from my initial offer, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement.",1300000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate the effort you're putting into this negotiation. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,300,000. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer $1,315,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I hope we can meet in the middle.",1315000.0,Alice,5,
