Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're starting the negotiation, I'm willing to offer it to you for $900000. This is a great starting point, and I'm open to discussing further. What do you think?

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $900,000 is unfortunately above my budget. I'm interested in this product, but I can only go as high as $850,000 right now.  Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 850000}

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still confident that this product can bring significant value to your business. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our initial offer and your counteroffer. I'm proposing a new price of $875000. This is a compromise that I believe is reasonable, considering the product's worth to you. What do you think?

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's budget, it's still $75,000 over what he's willing to pay. There's still room for negotiation, and Bob has a good chance of getting a better deal. It's wiser to continue negotiating and explore further counteroffers before committing to Alice's price or purchasing from John."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $875,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm prepared to offer $825,000.  This is a fair price considering my budget and the product's value to me. I'm hoping we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 825000}

This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to me. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $850,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $835,000, which I believe is a fair price considering the value we both place on this product.  Let's try to close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 835000}

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I appreciate your persistence, and I'm willing to consider your proposal. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $835000. I'm willing to make one more compromise, but I need to get closer to my initial offer. I'm proposing a new price of $845000. This is the final compromise I'm willing to make. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm willing to close the deal. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $845,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $845,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $845,000 is only $45,000 lower than her previous offer.  Bob has already made several counteroffers and is getting close to his budget limit. At this point, the risk of continuing to negotiate with Alice is too high.  There's a chance that Alice might not accept his next counteroffer, leading to further rounds of negotiation and potentially exceeding the 10-round limit. It's more prudent for Bob to buy the product from John for $800,000, securing the product within his budget and avoiding any further negotiation risks."
