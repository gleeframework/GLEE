"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,250,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly lower than my asking price and still leaves you with a substantial profit margin. Let me know what you think.",1250000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the discount, but I would like to propose a price of $1,100,000 for your product. I believe this is a fair compromise that allows both of us to benefit.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to negotiate, but $1,100,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to my initial offer. I'm prepared to sell for $1,200,000. This gives you a good deal while allowing me to get a fair price. What do you say?",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to counter with an offer of $1,150,000 for your product. I believe this strikes a balance between your original asking price and the price you've offered since. I hope this proposal will be acceptable to you.",1150000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm really trying to work with you here, but $1,150,000 is still too far off from what I need. How about we meet in the middle at $1,175,000? This is my final offer. If you're not willing to accept this, I'll have to move on to another buyer.",1175000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I've carefully considered your last offer and I would like to counter with an offer of $1,160,000 for your product. I believe this is a fair compromise that respects both our interests. I hope this proposal will be agreeable to you.",1160000.0,Bob,6,
