"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this great product for $130. It's a steal considering its value! Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 130} 
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price slightly higher than the product's worth to Bob ($120). This leaves room for negotiation and gives me the upper hand. 
* **Positive Framing:**  The message emphasizes the value of the product and uses positive language (""steal,"" ""great"") to encourage Bob to consider the offer. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** I acknowledge that it's a negotiation by saying ""Let me know what you think."" This shows I'm open to discussion but also sets the tone that I'm not desperate to sell."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe I can find a better deal elsewhere. I am willing to pay up to $110 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price of $120. While it's tempting to accept his offer, it's important to remember that I have other options. I'm confident I can negotiate a better price with Bob, or at least get closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $110 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down a bit to $115. Let's meet in the middle and make this happen."", ""product_price"": 115}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-Proposal:** I'm rejecting Bob's offer but proposing a new price that is closer to his offer. 
* **Middle Ground:**  By stating ""meet in the middle,"" I'm emphasizing that I'm being flexible and showing a willingness to compromise.
* **Positive Tone:**  The message remains positive and focuses on reaching a mutually agreeable solution."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to counter with a price of $108 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $108
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While I'm open to negotiation, Bob's offer of $108 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $120.  I'm confident I can still get a better price from him or, at worst, sell to John for $120."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $108 is still not quite there. I'm willing to come down to $112.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 112}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Firm but Flexible:** I'm sticking to my minimum acceptable price range while showing willingness to compromise further. 
* **Focus on Common Ground:** The message emphasizes finding a solution that works for both of us.
* **Maintain Positive Tone:**  Keeping a positive, collaborative tone is crucial in negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I am willing to consider $110 as my final counteroffer for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's final offer of $110 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $120.  I've already made significant concessions, and further negotiation might not get me to my desired price.  Therefore, selling to John for $120 is the most logical decision at this point.  It guarantees me the minimum value I'm seeking, avoiding the risk of continuing negotiations with Bob and potentially getting a lower price."
