"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  That price is a bit too high for me, but I'm definitely interested in the product. How about we start the negotiations at $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective, but $800,000 is significantly below its true value. To move this forward, I could consider $1,500,000. This feels like a fair compromise.",1500000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I'm sensing we're getting closer. While $1,000,000 is still under my initial expectations, I'm willing to be flexible. How about we meet in the middle at $1,300,000? This reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your interest.",1300000.0,Alice,5,
