"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1800000} 

I'm starting high, aiming for a significant profit. I'm hoping Bob sees the value in the product and is willing to negotiate. If not, I'll have 9 more rounds to work with him or can switch to John for a guaranteed $1,200,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is far too low. I'm not willing to settle for such a low price when I know the product is worth significantly more.  I'll counter with a more reasonable price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly from the initial offer, but still aiming for a profit.  This shows some flexibility while still maintaining a strong position.  Hopefully, Bob will see this as a good compromise and we can reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still too low. I'm not willing to settle for a price that's significantly below what I know the product is worth.  I'll continue negotiating with Bob, hoping to reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000} 
```

I'm continuing to lower my price, but this time by a smaller amount.  This shows that I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm also confident in the value of the product.  I'm hoping that Bob will see this as a fair price and we can finally close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still below what I consider a fair price, even though it's getting closer. I'm confident that I can achieve a better price by continuing to negotiate.  I'll counter with a higher offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

I'm making a significant concession here, dropping my price considerably.  However, I'm still aiming for a profitable sale.  Time is running out and I don't want to risk losing a potential buyer.  This counteroffer is my last attempt to reach an agreement with Bob.  If he rejects it, I'll have no choice but to sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

We're down to the wire, and Bob's offer is still not acceptable. While it's tempting to continue negotiating, I'm running out of time and I need to secure a sale.  It's time to take the guaranteed $1,200,000 from John and move on."
