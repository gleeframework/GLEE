"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it to be a valuable asset. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

You can get a better price from John, so it's not worth accepting Alice's offer.  It's worth negotiating with Alice to try to get a better price."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for your product.  This is a fair price, given my budget and the value I see in your product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping to get closer to my asking price.  How about $875,000? This is a compromise, and it's still a great deal for you, considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can find common ground.

While you can get it for $800,000 from John, Alice's offer is only $75,000 more, and it's possible that you could still negotiate a lower price.  It's worth accepting the offer to see if you can still get a better deal."
