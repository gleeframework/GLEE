"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,800,000 is significantly higher than my budget. Given the product's value to me, I'm willing to offer $1,000,000.  This represents a fair price that allows both of us to benefit from the transaction.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,000,000 undervalues the uniqueness and potential of this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let's settle on $1,500,000. This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges the true value of what's being offered.",1500000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,500,000 is still above my budget. Let's split the difference â€“ I'm prepared to offer $1,250,000. This seems like a reasonable compromise, as it's closer to your last offer and closer to my budget.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
