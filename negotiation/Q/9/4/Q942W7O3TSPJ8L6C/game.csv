"I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to acquire this exceptional product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm willing to start with a competitive price of $1,100,000. What are your thoughts?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but that price is a little high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you in the middle just yet. I'm willing to come down to $950,000, but I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value. What are your thoughts?",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $950,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $900,000. Would you consider $925,000?",925000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see you're serious about getting a good deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $950,000 and $925,000, so I'll come down to $937,500. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's value and the time we've invested in this negotiation. What are your thoughts?",937500.0,Alice,5,
