{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,250,000. It's a fair price considering its value and the potential benefits it offers. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 1250000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$1,250,000:** This price is a compromise between my minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000) and Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000).  It's a starting point that allows room for negotiation but still leaves me with a significant profit.
* **Message:** My message is friendly and direct, emphasizing the fair price and potential benefits. This sets a positive tone and encourages Bob to consider the offer seriously."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I believe we can reach a more agreeable price. How about $1,100,000? I hope this proposal works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below what I consider fair. I'm willing to continue negotiating, hoping to secure a better deal.  By rejecting his offer, I can make a counteroffer and hopefully push the price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I understand your perspective, I'm still aiming for a price closer to $1,200,000. It's a fair compromise that acknowledges the product's value and allows for both of us to benefit from the transaction. Let's see if we can find a meeting point here."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Product Price:**  I'm lowering my previous price slightly to $1,200,000. This shows flexibility and willingness to compromise while still maintaining a price that's profitable for me.
* **Message:** I'm acknowledging Bob's offer but firmly stating my desired price point.  The message emphasizes the fairness of the price and the potential for a mutually beneficial outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I've given this careful consideration and would like to propose $1,150,000 as the price for your product. I believe this strikes a balance between acknowledging its value and staying within my budget. I look forward to your response. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $1,150,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000 than his previous offer.  While I would ideally prefer a higher price, accepting this offer ensures a sale and a decent profit.  Further negotiation might not yield a significantly better outcome, and the risk of Bob walking away or me missing out on the deal with John is not worth it at this point."
