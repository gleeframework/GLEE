"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $18,000 is a bit steep for me. Considering the value you've mentioned, I'm willing to pay $12,500. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",12500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer.  While I appreciate your interest, $12,500 is a bit too low for me to consider. How about we meet in the middle at $15,000?",15000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $15,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $13,500, which is a fair compromise. Let's see if we can reach an agreement on this price.",13500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $13,500 is getting closer, but I need to get a bit more for it to make sense for me. Would you consider $14,250?",14250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm happy we're getting closer. How about we split the difference and settle on $14,000? I believe this is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident it's a deal we can both agree on.",14000.0,Bob,6,
