"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which has been meticulously designed to meet your needs. It comes with advanced features that can significantly enhance your operations or personal use. Given its high quality and functionality, we believe it's worth considering at a special introductory price of $18000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is significantly higher than Bob's maximum budget of $10,000. It's too early to buy from John, as there's potential to negotiate a better price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the features you've highlighted. While I recognize the value of this product, $18,000 is unfortunately out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for it, which I believe is a fair price considering my needs and the market value."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your interest in our product. To accommodate your budget while still valuing the product's true worth, I am willing to negotiate further. My counteroffer is $14000 for the product. This price reflects a balance between your budget constraints and the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $14,000 is still above Bob's budget, but it shows a willingness to negotiate.  Rather than immediately buying from John, Bob should try to negotiate further to see if he can get closer to his target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $14,000 is still a bit higher than I can comfortably afford. I'm prepared to offer $12,000 for the product. This is a significant price point for me, and I believe it reflects a fair compromise given the value of the product and my budget."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your continued interest, Bob. I appreciate your efforts to find a mutually agreeable price. In light of your latest offer, I am pleased to present a counteroffer of $13000 for the product. This price aims to strike a balance between your budget and the product's value, while also allowing us to reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $13,000 is still above Bob's budget. While it shows progress, there's still room for further negotiation.  Since Bob has time and is close to his target, continuing to counteroffer is a better strategy than settling or going to John at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm very close to my budget limit.  I'm happy to meet you halfway and offer $12,500 for the product. This is my final offer, and I believe it reflects a fair compromise given the value of the product and my budget."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your efforts to reach a fair agreement. Considering the product's value and your budget constraints, I am willing to accept $12750 as the final price for the product. This price reflects a reasonable compromise that respects both our interests. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $12,750 is only $750 above Bob's target price of $12,000.  This is a very good deal for Bob, considering he could buy the product from John for $10,000. It's not worth risking further negotiation for a small price difference, especially since there are only 3 rounds left. Accepting this offer ensures Bob gets the product at a reasonable price within his budget."
