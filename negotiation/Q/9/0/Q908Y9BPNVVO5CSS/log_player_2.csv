"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above her own valuation.  I can likely get a better price by negotiating.  I have 10 rounds to work with, so I'm not in a rush to accept the first offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,000,000}
```

**Reasoning:** I'm starting with a significant counteroffer to signal that I'm serious about getting a good deal. This price is still above Alice's valuation, but it gives her some room to negotiate while staying below my maximum budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice's offer is still above my ideal price. I have 7 rounds left to negotiate.  I'll reject the offer and see if I can get her down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,100,000}
```

**Reasoning:** I'm increasing my counteroffer slightly from the last round, but still keeping it below Alice's offer.  This shows I'm willing to negotiate but also that I'm not going to drastically increase my offer just because she raised hers. This also leaves room for further negotiation if Alice rejects this offer again."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** While Alice's offer is getting closer to my maximum budget, it's still not a good deal for me. I'm not in a rush to buy, and I have 5 rounds left to negotiate.  I'm hoping to bring the price down further, and I'm not willing to settle for a price that's still significantly above her own valuation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,200,000}
```

**Reasoning:** I'm increasing my counteroffer again, but this time I'm matching Alice's previous offer. This shows that I'm willing to meet her halfway, and it's a price that I'm comfortable with. I'm hoping that Alice will accept this offer and we can finalize the deal.  I'm still within my budget, and it's closer to Alice's valuation than her last offer."
