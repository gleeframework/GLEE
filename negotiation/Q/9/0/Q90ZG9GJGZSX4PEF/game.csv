"I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,200,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it. I believe it's a fair price considering the market value.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While I understand your perspective on the price, $900,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This price still reflects the value of the product, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,050,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll counter with $950,000. I think this is a fair price for the product.",950000.0,Bob,4,
