"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting the negotiation, I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $800,000. What do you think?",800000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I see the value in your product,  $800,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm happy to pay $700,000, which reflects the value I'm placing on the product at this stage. Let me know what you think.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $750,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $750,000 is getting closer, but I'm still hoping for a bit more.  Given the value we both see in this product, I'd like to offer $725,000.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap and finalize this deal.",725000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your persistence, and I'm willing to meet you halfway again. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $725,000. I'm willing to offer the product to you for $735,000.
