"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $18,000. This is a competitive price considering its worth to you is $12,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is quite high. I'm interested in the product, but I have a budget in mind. Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $10,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer the product to you for $14,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you and the market. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",14000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  $14,000 is closer to what I had in mind, but it's still a bit of a stretch for my budget. Would you consider $11,500? That would make it much easier for me to say yes.",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $11,500 is still a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer the product to you for $13,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to you and the market. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",13000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to work with me on the price.  To be honest, I've found a similar product elsewhere for $12,000. I'd prefer to work with you, but I'm also trying to be mindful of my budget. Would you be willing to match that price? If so, we have a deal.",12000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you've found a similar product elsewhere for $12,000, but I'm not willing to match that price. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway between $12,000 and my original offer of $14,000. I can offer the product to you for $13,500. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you and the market. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",13500.0,Alice,7,
