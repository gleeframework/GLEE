"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $20,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested, but only if we can settle on a price closer to $12,000.  What do you think?",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $12,000 is a bit too low for me to consider, but I understand you see the value. How about we meet in the middle at $17,000?",17000.0,Alice,3,
