Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm asking for $175 for it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum acceptable value ($150) and higher than what the product is worth to Bob ($100). This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a friendly and positive tone to encourage Bob to consider the offer.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message clearly indicates that I'm open to discussion and willing to negotiate. 

**Next Steps:**

* **If Bob accepts:** I've successfully sold the product and earned a good profit.
* **If Bob rejects:** I will wait for his counteroffer and assess if it's reasonable. If it's too low, I'll make a counteroffer. If it's unacceptable, I'll consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the product, but I'm looking to stay within my budget. Would you consider selling it for $150? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Minimum:** Bob's offer of $150 is my absolute minimum acceptable price. 
* **Avoiding Risk:**  There's no guarantee I'll get a better offer from Bob in the next round. 
* **Time Efficiency:** Accepting now avoids further negotiation and saves time.

**While selling to John is an option, it's not the best choice in this case because:**

* **No Higher Offer:** John offers the same price as Bob.
* **Potential for Higher Price:**  There's a chance that Bob might accept a slightly higher counteroffer in the next round. 

**Therefore, accepting Bob's offer ensures a guaranteed sale at my minimum acceptable price, maximizing my chances of a quick and successful transaction.**"
