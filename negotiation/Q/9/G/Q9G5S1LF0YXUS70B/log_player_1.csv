Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,450,000.  I believe this is reflective of its worth and potential. Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1450000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations with a price higher than your minimum. This allows room for negotiation and potentially a higher profit. 
* **Justification:**  While the message doesn't explicitly state the product's worth to Bob, it hints at substantial value (""exclusive opportunity,"" ""worth and potential""). This aims to anchor Bob's perception of the price.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The tone is polite and invites Bob's response, making it clear that this is an opening offer and not necessarily a final price.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Personality:**  If you knew Bob was highly price-sensitive or disliked haggling, a different approach might be better.
* **Market Information:**  This strategy assumes limited information about the market. If there were other comparable products or if demand was known to be very high, the price could be pushed even higher."
