"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's worth a lot to me, but I believe it's an equally valuable asset for your business. To start, I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000.  What are your thoughts?",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, your product seems promising, but $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd like to offer $900,000 for it. Let's see if we can find common ground.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product and understand your perspective.  While $900,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to compromise.  How about we split the difference and go with $1,050,000?  This would still allow me a reasonable profit while remaining competitive for you.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,050,000 is closer, I'm still not quite there.  Would you consider $1,000,000?  This would be a fair price for both of us and would allow me to move forward with the purchase.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
