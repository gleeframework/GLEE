"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's worth a lot to me, but I believe it's an equally valuable asset for your business. To start, I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000.  What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:

{""message"": ""Alice, your product seems promising, but $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd like to offer $900,000 for it. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product and understand your perspective.  While $900,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to compromise.  How about we split the difference and go with $1,050,000?  This would still allow me a reasonable profit while remaining competitive for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,050,000 is closer, I'm still not quite there.  Would you consider $1,000,000?  This would be a fair price for both of us and would allow me to move forward with the purchase."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
