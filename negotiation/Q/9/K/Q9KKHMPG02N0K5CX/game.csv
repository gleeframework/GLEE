"Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe would be a great asset for you. I'm offering it to you for $13,000.  This price reflects its value and allows for a good margin for you. Let me know what you think!",13000.0,Alice,1,,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  While I value your business, $12,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $12,500? This would still give you a great price, and it's a fair offer for me. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",12500.0,Alice,3,,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to pay $11,500 for the product. Let's see if we can meet in the middle again.",11500.0,Bob,4,,

"Bob, I'm starting to think we might not be able to agree on a price.  I'm willing to go down to $12,000 to make this work, but that's my absolute bottom line.  If you're not able to meet me there, I'm going to have to look at other options.",12000.0,Alice,5,,
