{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000.  It's a great deal for both of us, and I believe this price reflects the value it holds for you.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** $1,200,000 is a good starting point. It's higher than Bob's perceived value, but still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. This allows room for negotiation.
* **Message:** The message is friendly and focuses on the benefits for both of us. It avoids putting too much pressure on Bob. 

**Strategy:**

* **Start high:** By starting at $1,200,000, I can potentially get a higher price than if I started lower.
* **Leave room for negotiation:** By leaving room between my starting price and my minimum, I allow for Bob to make counteroffers without me feeling forced to sell immediately.
* **Have a backup plan:**  Having John willing to pay $1,500,000 gives me leverage and a safety net if the negotiation with Bob fails."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I am interested in purchasing your product, and I would like to propose a price of $950,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that respects the value of the product while also allowing me to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.**  I'm not willing to sell at such a significant loss.
* **Rejecting the offer allows me to counteroffer and potentially get a better price.**  I believe I can push for a higher price by leveraging my backup option of selling to John.

**Next Steps:**

I will counteroffer Bob with a price closer to my desired price point, but still below my minimum acceptable price.  I'll aim for a compromise that's both beneficial to me and attractive to Bob."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate your interest. However, $950,000 is still below what I need to consider.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000, which is still a significant discount from my initial offer.  Let me know if you're interested in this price."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

**Explanation:**

* **Message:** The message is still friendly and focuses on the benefit of the price to Bob.  I reiterate my willingness to compromise while emphasizing my minimum price. 

**Strategy:**

* **Negotiate strategically:**  I'm aiming for a middle ground that's attractive to Bob while also getting closer to my desired price.
* **Maintain leverage:**  I'm not rushing to accept Bob's offer. I'm reminding him that I have a backup buyer (John) who is willing to pay more. 
* **Signal flexibility:** I'm demonstrating willingness to compromise by reducing my price from the first offer. This encourages Bob to come back with a counteroffer that is closer to my desired price."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I understand your position, but I'm still looking to keep the cost closer to my budget. I would like to propose a price of $1,050,000. This is a step towards meeting your needs while keeping the transaction within my financial limits. I hope we can come to an agreement.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.**  While it's getting closer, it's still not a price I'm comfortable with.
* **Rejecting the offer allows me to counteroffer and potentially get a higher price.** I believe I can still negotiate for a better price, especially since I have the option of selling to John for a significantly higher price.

**Next Steps:**

I will counteroffer Bob with a price closer to my minimum acceptable price, but still below my minimum acceptable price. I'll aim for a compromise that's both beneficial to me and attractive to Bob. I will also try to emphasize the value of the product and the benefits of purchasing it from me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate.  I understand your budget constraints, but $1,050,000 is still quite a bit lower than what I need to make this worthwhile.  Let's try to bridge the gap. I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000.  This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us. I hope you'll consider this final offer."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm offering $1,150,000. This is closer to my minimum acceptable price but still leaves some room for negotiation. It also shows I'm serious about a deal but not willing to accept a lowball offer.
* **Message:** I acknowledge Bob's budget and emphasize fairness for both of us. I call this a ""final offer"" to create a sense of urgency and encourage Bob to accept.

**Strategy:**

* **Getting closer to my goal:** I'm slowly increasing the offer price, getting closer to my minimum.
* **Maintaining leverage:**  I still have the option of selling to John, so I'm not desperate to accept Bob's offer.
* **Setting a deadline:**  The ""final offer"" message creates a sense of urgency and might encourage Bob to accept."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your latest offer. I've been considering our discussions carefully, and I would like to propose a price of $1,100,000. This is a reasonable compromise between our positions and keeps the transaction within my financial limits. I hope this proposal is acceptable to you.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is now at $1,100,000, which is within my minimum acceptable price range of $1,500,000.**  This is a good deal for me, as it's higher than his initial offer and closer to my desired price.
* **Accepting the offer allows me to close the deal and avoid further negotiation.** While I could potentially push for a slightly higher price, the risk of losing the deal altogether outweighs the potential gain.

**Strategy:**

* **Secure the deal:**  By accepting Bob's offer, I ensure a sale and a significant profit.
* **Avoid further risk:**  Negotiating further could lead to a deadlock, forcing me to sell to John at a lower price. Accepting this offer minimizes risk and ensures a good outcome.
