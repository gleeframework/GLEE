"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I am interested in purchasing your product, and I would like to propose a price of $950,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that respects the value of the product while also allowing me to stay within my budget.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate your interest. However, $950,000 is still below what I need to consider.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000, which is still a significant discount from my initial offer.  Let me know if you're interested in this price.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I understand your position, but I'm still looking to keep the cost closer to my budget. I would like to propose a price of $1,050,000. This is a step towards meeting your needs while keeping the transaction within my financial limits. I hope we can come to an agreement.",1050000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate.  I understand your budget constraints, but $1,050,000 is still quite a bit lower than what I need to make this worthwhile.  Let's try to bridge the gap. I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000.  This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us. I hope you'll consider this final offer.",1150000.0,Alice,5,
