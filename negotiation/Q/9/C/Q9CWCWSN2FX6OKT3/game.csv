"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product that I think you'll love. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm confident will exceed your expectations. I'm willing to sell it to you for $15000. Is this a price you're comfortable with?",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product, $12000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $8000 for it, which is my maximum budget. Let me know if that's a price we can work with.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your honesty about your budget. However, I'm afraid $8000 is below my minimum price for this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $11000 for it. Would you be willing to consider that price?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $11000 is closer, it's still a bit out of my budget.  I'm prepared to offer $9500, which is a significant step closer to your price and the best I can do.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, $9500 is still a bit short of what I'm looking for. I'm willing to meet you at $10500, which is my best price for now. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",10500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  $10500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $9800.  This is a fair price, and I believe it's a win-win for both of us. Let me know your thoughts.",9800.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm starting to think we're getting a bit too far apart. I'm willing to meet you at $10200, which is my absolute minimum for this product. If we can agree on that price, I'm happy to finalize the deal with you.",10200.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position. While $10200 is still a stretch for me,  I'm willing to compromise and offer $9900. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can close this deal.  Let's not let this opportunity slip away.",9900.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm starting to feel like we're getting too close to the minimum price I'm willing to accept. I'm willing to meet you at $10500, but I need to emphasize that this is my final offer. If we can agree on this price, I'm happy to finalize the deal with you. If not, I'll have to consider other options.",10500.0,Alice,9,
