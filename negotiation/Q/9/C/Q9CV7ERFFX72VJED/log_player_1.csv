Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,200,000 from John, so you shouldn't accept anything less.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $800,000 to Bob.  He won't pay more than this.
* **Zone of Possible Agreement (ZOPA):**  Exists between $800,000 (Bob's max) and $1,200,000 (your minimum).

**Strategy**

You want to aim for the higher end of the ZOPA. Since you have a guaranteed buyer, you're in a strong position. You can afford to start high and negotiate down if needed.

**Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its unique value and potential, I'm offering it at $1,100,000. I believe this represents a fair price for such a valuable asset."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Strong Opening:** This offer is closer to your minimum but leaves some room for negotiation.
* **Value Emphasis:**  The message highlights the ""unique value"" to entice Bob.
* **Confident Tone:** Using phrases like ""fair price"" and ""valuable asset"" projects confidence in your position.

**Important Considerations**

* **Bob's Personality:** If you know Bob is a tough negotiator, you might start slightly lower within the ZOPA.
* **Relationship:** If a long-term business relationship with Bob is important, a more moderate initial offer might be preferable.

**Remember:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob. If he rejects it, you can always counter-offer. You hold the advantage with your guaranteed buyer, John."
