"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own a truly unique item. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12000. This is a great deal, considering the value it brings. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Since Alice is offering the product for $12,000, and you are willing to pay up to $12,000, you can reject Alice's offer and buy from John for the same price. This gives you more options in the future, like potentially negotiating with Alice later."
