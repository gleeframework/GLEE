"I understand that you're looking to invest a bit less, Bob. However, I have to consider my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $1,100,000 for the product. Can we discuss further?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1,100,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000 for the product. This would still be a good deal for you, and it's the highest I can go at this time.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to go up to $1,000,000, Bob. However, I'm still a bit short of my minimum price. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get at least $1,050,000 for the product. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
