Round 3
Alice's offer:

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

""product_price"": 75
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm trying to be flexible, but I can't go as low as $75.  How about we split the difference and call it $85? That's my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Reason:While Alice's offer of $85 is tempting, it's still above our $80 limit. John offers a guaranteed price of $80, ensuring we stay within budget."
