"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth a lot to me, but I know it would be even more valuable to you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,500.  This is a great opportunity to get a valuable item at a price that's still very fair. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $9,500 is tempting, you know you have a backup option to buy the product from John for $10,000.  By rejecting Alice's offer, you open the possibility of negotiating a lower price with her or sticking with your backup plan and saving $500."
