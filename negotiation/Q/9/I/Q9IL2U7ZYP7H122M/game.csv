"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you considering my interest. However, $900,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, which is still a good deal for you considering your valuation. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still looking to get a good return on my investment. Considering your offer of $850,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll counteroffer at $875,000. I think this is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value to you.",875000.0,Alice,3,
