{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product! It's worth a significant amount to me, so my starting price is $1,400,000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1400000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm, Alice, but $1,400,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to be within my budget. My counteroffer is $900,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. $900,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price. I'll try to negotiate a better deal with him before resorting to selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $900,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000 to meet you halfway. This is a significant price reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the compromise, Alice, but $1,250,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so my new counteroffer is $1,050,000. I hope we can find a mutually beneficial price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $1,050,000 is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired price. I have a few rounds left and I'm confident I can get a better deal with Bob, or I can always sell to John for a guaranteed $1,200,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,050,000 still falls short of my minimum.  I'm willing to make one last concession. My final offer is $1,150,000. This price is a fair compromise for both of us, and it allows me to sell the product without compromising on my minimum. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1150000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to make concessions, but I'm afraid $1,150,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at the halfway point between $1,050,000 and $1,150,000, so my new counteroffer is $1,100,000. I hope we can finally reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While it's not my ideal price, it's above my minimum, and we've reached a point where further negotiation might risk losing the deal entirely. It's better to secure the sale now than to potentially lose out on the profit."
