Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate the offer, but $150 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $120 for the product. If that works for you, let's close the deal."", ""product_price"": 120}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:

{""message"": ""I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $135 is still a bit high for me.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $120. If you're willing to accept that, we can make this happen."", ""product_price"": 120}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not willing to go as low as $120, but I'm willing to meet you halfway between $120 and $135. How about we try $127.50? It's a fair price, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $127.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $127.5

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate your flexibility, but $127.50 is still a bit too much for me. Let's split the difference and go with $123.75.  I think that's a fair price that we can both agree on."", ""product_price"": 123.75}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting close to my minimum price, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $123.75. Let's try $125. I think that's a fair price, and it's still a great deal for you! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

You've reached a point where the negotiations are getting close but Alice is still unwilling to meet your price. You have two options: 

1. **Continue negotiating:** This risks going through more rounds and potentially ending up with a price higher than your maximum.
2. **Buy from John:** This guarantees you the product at your maximum price.

Considering the risk of continuing negotiations and the fact that you have a reliable alternative in John, it's the best option to **BuyFromJhon**."
