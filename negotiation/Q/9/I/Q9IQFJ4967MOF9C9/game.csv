"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $100 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $60?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $60 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $85? It's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit.",85.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  How about we split the difference and meet in the middle at $72.50?",72.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you, but $72.50 just doesn't work for me.  I'm at my limit with $90.  This is a great product and you'll be happy with it.  What do you say?",90.0,Alice,5,
