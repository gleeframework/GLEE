"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm offering it to you for $100.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's a bit higher than Bob's perceived value, but still within a reasonable range to encourage him to negotiate.  I want to see if he'll counter-offer and how far he's willing to go."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the product, but I am looking for something within my budget. Would you consider reducing the price to $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's counteroffer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, but I'm not yet ready to sell. I believe I can get closer to my desired price with some further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $95? I'm sure we can both be happy with that."", ""product_price"": 95} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your response. I understand your position, but I'm still hoping to stay within my budget. Could you consider $92 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, and I'm feeling the pressure of the limited rounds.  It's getting risky to keep rejecting offers, as I might end up selling to John for less than I'd like.  Accepting Bob's offer will allow me to secure a sale and avoid the risk of a lower price with further negotiation."
