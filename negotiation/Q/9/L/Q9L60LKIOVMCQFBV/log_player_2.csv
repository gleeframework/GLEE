{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  $600,000 is a good price, but there's room for negotiation. I want to see if I can get a better deal before committing."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 500000}
```

**Reasoning:** I'm starting with a significant counteroffer to gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate. A $100,000 reduction shows I'm serious about buying but also sets the stage for a potential middle ground."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**  Alice's offer is higher than my initial counteroffer, but I still believe there's potential to negotiate a lower price. I'll make another counteroffer to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 550000}

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**  While $700,000 is getting closer to my budget, it's still too high.  I'm willing to risk a few more rounds of negotiation to see if I can get closer to my target price."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 600000}
```

**Reasoning:**  Alice's offer is getting too close to my fallback option with John. I'm making a counteroffer at the midpoint between our last two offers. This shows I'm serious about buying but still hoping to find a middle ground. If this offer is rejected, I might have to consider going with John in the next round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**  Alice's offer is getting too close to John's price. With only a few rounds left, the risk of failing to reach a deal is high.  It's time to secure the product from John and avoid any further potential price increases from Alice."
