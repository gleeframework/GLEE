"Alice, thank you for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $1500000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'd be willing to pay $1200000.  This would allow us both to benefit from the deal while staying within my budget.  Let me know your thoughts.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. However, $1200000 is below the minimum I'm willing to accept for this product.  I'm confident in its value and believe it can bring significant returns for your business. To reflect this, I'm willing to come down to $1350000.  This is a fair price that allows for a mutually beneficial arrangement while staying within my minimum price point. Let me know your thoughts.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price.  $1350000 is closer to what I had in mind, but I'm still hoping to find a price that works better for both of us. I'm prepared to offer $1250000.  This price reflects a compromise on both our sides and allows us to move forward with the deal.  What are your thoughts?",1250000.0,Bob,4,
