Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer, close to my minimum acceptable price, to see if Bob is willing to pay close to my value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum, but I'm willing to negotiate further.  I'll see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}

I'm lowering my price a bit, but still staying above my minimum. I'm hoping this counteroffer will be more appealing to Bob and we can reach a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still too low. While I'm running out of time, I'm hoping to get closer to my desired price. I'll counteroffer again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}

I'm lowering my price again, but I'm still confident that I can get a better deal than John's offer.  I'm hoping this counteroffer will convince Bob to close the deal."

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offers are consistently below my minimum, and we're getting close to the end of the negotiation rounds. It's time to secure a guaranteed sale with John, as it's  more profitable than continuing to negotiate with Bob."
