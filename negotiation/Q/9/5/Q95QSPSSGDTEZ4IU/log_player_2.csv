You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is too high. It's well above her value of $800,000 and leaves a significant profit margin for her. It's worth negotiating to see if we can get a better price. Buying from John is also not a good option as his price is significantly higher than Alice's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial offer, but it's still above her value of $800,000. This shows Alice that we're serious about negotiating but are also trying to secure a good deal for ourselves."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still higher than what we'd like to pay. We can likely negotiate further. Buying from John is still too expensive compared to what we're currently negotiating with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price slightly, but we can still try to push for a lower price. This counteroffer increases our bid by a smaller amount than the previous round, showing Alice we are willing to compromise while still trying to save money."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is still offering a price higher than what we're aiming for, but we're getting closer to a potential deal. We can continue negotiating to try and secure a lower price. Buying from John is still too expensive compared to the current negotiations with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has increased her price again. This is likely a tactic to see if we are willing to meet her demands. However, her offer is still too high. We can likely negotiate further and hopefully reach a price that is more favorable for us.  Buying from John is still too expensive."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's price increase shows she's not as desperate for a deal as we thought. But we've come a long way, and we're willing to meet her halfway again. This counteroffer is a significant step towards her last offer, but it still leaves room for negotiation and allows us to maintain leverage."

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

We're getting close to the end of our negotiations. While we'd prefer a lower price, Alice's offer is getting closer to our target range. We've shown our willingness to negotiate, and if we reject this offer, we risk ending up with no deal. This offer is still much better than buying from John, and with only one round left, it's a reasonable compromise to secure the product."
