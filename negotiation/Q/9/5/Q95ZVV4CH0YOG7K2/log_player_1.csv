Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer to Bob:

**Understanding the Situation**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,200,000 from John, so you won't accept less.
* **Bob's Valuation:**  Bob values the product at $1,500,000, meaning there's a potential profit margin of $300,000.
* **One Shot:** You only get one chance with Bob. If he rejects your offer, you go with John's guaranteed price.

**Strategy**

You need to balance maximizing your profit with the risk of Bob rejecting the offer. Offering a price too close to $1,500,000 might scare him away.

**The Offer**

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exclusive opportunity to acquire the product. Considering its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000. I believe this represents a fair deal given the unique benefits it offers."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```

**Explanation**

* **Message:** The message is framed positively, emphasizing the ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""fair deal.""
* **Price:** $1,350,000 is a strong opening move. It:
    *  Gives you a significant profit margin ($150,000 above your minimum).
    *  Leaves room for Bob to potentially negotiate down a bit if he wants. 
    *  Is still significantly below Bob's perceived value, making it likely he'll see the value in the deal.

**Important Notes**

* **Be Prepared to Negotiate:** Bob might counter-offer. Have a strategy in mind for how low you're willing to go. 
* **Confidence is Key:** Present your offer confidently. If Bob senses hesitation, he might be less likely to accept."
