"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this excellent product. I think it would be incredibly beneficial for you.  Given its value, I'm offering it at $15,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is far too high ($15,000) compared to your maximum budget of $8,000. It's essential to start negotiating and try to bring the price down."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the value you see in this product, $15,000 is significantly above my budget. To make this work, I'd need to get the price down to $8,000.  Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable price."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Direct Counteroffer:**  This immediately establishes your budget and sets the negotiating range.
* **Reasoning:**  Provides a justification for the counteroffer by mentioning your budget limitations.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The message emphasizes a willingness to find a compromise, creating a less adversarial tone."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $8,000 is significantly below its worth.  Let's find a middle ground. How about $13,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered the price, it's still significantly higher than my maximum budget of $8,000.  There's still room for negotiation to get closer to a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my offer. However, $13,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10,000. This would be a fair price for both of us and allow us to reach a deal."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  Offering a middle ground price shows a willingness to negotiate.
* **Fairness:**  Framing the counteroffer as ""fair"" for both sides helps maintain a positive negotiation tone.
* **Continuing Negotiation:**  The message implies that the counteroffer is not final and that you are still open to finding a mutually agreeable price."
