Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 150}
```

I'm starting with a price of $150. This gives me some room to negotiate if Bob wants to counteroffer, but it's also a decent starting point given the product is worth at least $100 to me.  I'll keep John's offer of $100 in mind as a fallback option if the negotiations with Bob don't go well."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $130 is better than John's offer, I think I can get closer to my desired price. I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 140}
```

I'm counteroffering at $140. It's a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer, showing I'm willing to negotiate. Hopefully, this will be a more appealing price for Bob, and we can reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $135
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer of $135. While I would have preferred a bit more, it's still a good price considering my minimum value and the fact that I could sell to John for $100. I don't want to risk losing Bob completely and ending up with the lower price."
