```

**Reasoning:** 

Alice is clearly holding firm on a price above $100. She's made it clear that $105 is the lowest she'll go, and now she's creeping back up.  It's unlikely she'll go below $100, and you have a guaranteed option with John at that price.  It's time to cut your losses and buy from John."
