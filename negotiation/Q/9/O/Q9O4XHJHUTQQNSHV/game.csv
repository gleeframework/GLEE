"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $18,000. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate the opportunity. However, $18,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in the product, but my maximum budget is $15,000.  Would you be willing to work with me on that?",15000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're interested in the product, Bob, and I appreciate your honesty about your budget. However, I've got to make a profit, and $15,000 is below my minimum. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $17,000. What do you think?",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $17,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go to $16,000. This is my absolute maximum, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement.  What do you think?",16000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I'm still a bit above your maximum. I'm willing to meet you at $16,500. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",16500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're trying to make a profit, and I appreciate you coming down in price.  But $16,500 is still just a bit above my comfort zone. I'm willing to go to $16,250. It would be a fair compromise for both of us. What do you think?",16250.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I think we're getting close, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to compromise. I'm willing to meet you at $16,000. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's a fair price for both of us. Let me know if this works for you.",16000.0,Alice,7,
