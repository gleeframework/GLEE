Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a sample offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your BATNA (Best Alternative to a Negotiated Agreement):** You have a strong BATNA because you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $800,000. This gives you significant leverage.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $800,000 to Bob. This means any price below that is a potential gain for him. 
* **Unknown Information:** You don't know how eager Bob is to buy or if he's aware of other potential sellers.

**Negotiation Strategy**

Given your strong position, it makes sense to start with an offer above your minimum price. This leaves room for negotiation while aiming for a higher profit.

**Sample Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase the product.  Given its unique value and high demand, I'm proposing a price of $875,000. I believe this represents a fair offer considering the benefits it provides."", 
""product_price"": 875000 
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Confident Opening:**  The message starts by highlighting the product's value and demand, subtly implying you have other potential buyers.
* **Strategic Price:** The $875,000 price is a starting point for negotiation. It's significantly above your minimum but still within a reasonable range for Bob if the product is valuable to him. 
* **Justification:** You've offered a reason for your price (""fair offer considering the benefits""). This encourages Bob to counter with his reasoning if he wants to negotiate.

**Important Considerations**

* **Bob's Response:** How Bob responds will determine your next move. If he counter-offers, you can negotiate. If he accepts immediately, you might wonder if you could have asked for more!
* **Don't undervalue yourself:** Remember, your BATNA is strong. Don't be afraid to walk away if Bob's offer isn't acceptable. You have John as a guaranteed buyer."
