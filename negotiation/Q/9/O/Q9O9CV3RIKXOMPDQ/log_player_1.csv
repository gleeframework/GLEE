Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than the product's worth to Bob, hoping to maximize my profits. I'm confident in the value of my product and believe Bob will be willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum value, I'm not willing to accept it yet. I believe I can still get a better price by counter-offering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500}
``` 

I'm counter-offering at $12,500, which is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counter-offer. This price is still higher than my minimum value, and I believe Bob will be willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is now at my minimum acceptable price.  I'm happy to accept this offer and avoid the risk of further negotiation."
