``` 

Bob should reject the offer.  The product is worth $12,000 to him, and Alice is asking for $13,000.  It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price."

Bob is offering $11,500. This is a significant reduction from Alice's initial price, but still leaves room for negotiation if Alice is willing to compromise."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's closer to his desired price, he can still try to get it lower.  He's only willing to pay $12,000 and John is willing to sell for that price."

Bob should offer the maximum price he's willing to pay, $12,000. This is a fair price, given that he has a backup option with John for the same price."
