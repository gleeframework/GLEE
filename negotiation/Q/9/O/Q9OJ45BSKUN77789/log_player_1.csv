Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,200,000 from John, so this is your absolute floor.
* **Bob's Value:**  Bob values the product at $800,000. Any offer above this has the potential to be profitable for him.
* **The Zone of Possible Agreement (ZOPA):**  The prices between $800,000 and $1,200,000 represent potential deals where both you and Bob could benefit.

**Strategy**

You want to aim high while still making the offer attractive enough for Bob to accept.  Here's how:

1. **Start High:** Begin with an offer closer to your desired price, leaving room for negotiation.
2. **Justify Your Price:**  Don't just throw out a number. Highlight the unique value of your product and why it justifies a higher price.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase [Product Name]. This product offers [Highlight key features and benefits relevant to Bob].  Given its unique value and potential, I'm offering it to you at $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the significant return on investment you'll experience."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **High but Reasonable:** $1,100,000 is a strong starting point, giving you room to negotiate while still being significantly above Bob's perceived value.
* **Focus on Value:** By emphasizing the product's benefits to Bob, you aim to shift his focus from the price tag to the value he's receiving.

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared for Bob to counter-offer, and be ready to negotiate to reach a mutually agreeable price within the ZOPA."
