"Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product and I think you'd really appreciate it.  I'm asking for $150 for it, which is a great deal considering its value.  What do you think?",150.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm really interested in the product, but $150 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $80, which is the maximum I'm willing to pay. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $120?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and I'm happy to negotiate.  $80 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $110.  This still gives me some wiggle room, and it's a great price for this product.  What do you say?",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. I'm still a bit hesitant to pay $110, but I'm willing to meet you halfway from our previous discussion. How about we settle on $95? I think that's a fair price for this product.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, $95 is still a bit low for me, but I'm trying to be fair.  I'm willing to go down to $105, which is a price I can live with.  Let's see if we can make a deal here.",105.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $105 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $90, which is the highest I'm willing to pay. Can we meet in the middle at $97.50?",90.0,Bob,6,
