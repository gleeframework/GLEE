"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a deal.

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $550000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts on this counteroffer.",550000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking that $550000 is a bit low considering the product's value to me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to propose a price of $575000. This is a fair price that I'm comfortable with, and I believe it's a good compromise between our initial offers.",575000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Alice. I understand your perspective, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I'd like to propose a price of $570000. I think this is a fair compromise, and I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase the product at this price. I hope we can come to an agreement.",570000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to consider your latest offer, but I still think $570000 is a bit low. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I'd like to propose a price of $585000. This is as high as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's a fair price for the product. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",585000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to consider your latest offer, but I'm not willing to give in completely. I'd like to propose a price of $600000. This is the maximum price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's still a fair price for the product. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm willing to make a deal.",600000.0,Alice,7,

"Thank you for your latest offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to consider my proposal. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to make one last concession, and I'd like to propose a price of $590000. I think this is a fair compromise, and I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase the product at this price. I hope we can come to an agreement.",590000.0,Bob,8,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I've already given you a significant discount from my initial offer. I'm not willing to go any lower than $600000, and I think it's time to consider other options. I'm not going to make another concession, so I'm going to propose a final offer of $600000. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other buyers who are willing to pay a higher price for the product.",600000.0,Alice,9,
