Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,000,000 from John, so you won't accept anything less.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,200,000, meaning there's a potential profit margin for him if he buys from you.
* **Information Asymmetry:** Bob doesn't know you have a guaranteed buyer at $1,000,000. This is your leverage.

**Strategy**

You want to aim high without alienating Bob completely.  Offering a price closer to his valuation increases the chance he'll accept, maximizing your profit.

**Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this unique product. Given its value and potential, I believe a price of $1,150,000 is fair. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **High but Reasonable Price:** $1,150,000 leaves Bob with a potential $50,000 gain, incentivizing him to accept. 
* **Sense of Urgency:**  Mentioning ""other interested parties"" (even if it's just John) adds pressure for Bob to act quickly. 
* **Confident Tone:**  By avoiding language like ""best offer"" or ""negotiable,"" you project confidence in your pricing.

**Important Note:** While this offer is a strong starting point, be prepared to adjust slightly downward if Bob counters. However, don't go below $1,050,000, as it cuts significantly into your potential profit."
