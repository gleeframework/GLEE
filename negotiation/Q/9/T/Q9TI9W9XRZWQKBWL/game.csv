"I'm really interested in the product, but $20000 is out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's quality and rarity, and I'm willing to make a serious offer for it.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $12000. I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $18000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and the time I've invested in it. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm not willing to compromise on the price too much.",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $18000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $15000. I'm confident that's a fair price for the product, and I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase it at that price.",15000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm not willing to sell the product for $15000. I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $16500. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and the negotiations we've had so far. I'm open to further negotiations, but I'm not willing to compromise on the price too much.",16500.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your persistence, Alice. However, $16500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to make one more serious offer. I'll meet you at $14000. I think this is a fair price considering the negotiations we've had so far, and I'm willing to make a commitment to purchase the product at this price.",14000.0,Bob,6,
