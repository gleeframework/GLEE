Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $120 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $60? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I reject Bob's offer. $60 is far too low for me, and I'm confident I can get a better price.  I'll counter with a price closer to my original offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $60 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about $90?  That's still a great price for you, considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 90} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $75 is closer to my minimum, I believe I can still do better.  I'll counter with a price that's closer to my valuation."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $75 is still a bit too low for me.  How about $85? This is a fair price that considers both our needs.  Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 85} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
