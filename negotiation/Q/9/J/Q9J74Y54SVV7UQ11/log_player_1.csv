"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $12,000. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe we can come to a better agreement. Considering the value of the product to me, I would like to propose a price of $9,500. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $9,500 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get closer to my desired price of $10,000. Bob has shown he's willing to negotiate, and I'll use this round to counter his offer and see if we can meet in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but I'm still looking for a bit closer to my initial asking price. How about $9,750? It's a fair compromise that leaves both of us with a good deal.  Let's get this done!"", ""product_price"": 9750}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I've given it some thought and am willing to meet you halfway. My counteroffer is $9,625. This price respects your initial asking price while also being within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,625. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,625
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's counteroffer of $9,625 is very close to my desired price point of $9,750. It's a good deal for me, and I don't want to risk losing the sale by continuing to negotiate. Accepting his offer allows me to secure a profitable transaction and avoid potential complications with further negotiations."
