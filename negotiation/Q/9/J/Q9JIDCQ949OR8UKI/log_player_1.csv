Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a sample offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** $1,500,000 (You have a guaranteed sale at this price)
* **Bob's Value:** $1,200,000
* **Potential Profit:**  The difference between Bob's value and your minimum offers a potential profit margin.

**Strategy**

You want to offer a price that's attractive enough for Bob to accept, while still maximizing your profit.  Since you have a guaranteed sale with John, you can be a bit bolder with your offer to Bob.

**Sample Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this product before I open it up to other buyers. Given its unique value proposition, I'm proposing a price of $1,450,000. I believe this represents a significant advantage for you to acquire it at a premium."",
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Exclusivity:** Highlighting that Bob has a limited-time offer can create a sense of urgency.
* **Value Focus:**  Instead of just stating the price, emphasize the ""unique value proposition.""
* **Premium Positioning:** Framing the price as a ""premium"" acknowledges it's above market value but suggests it's justified by the product's benefits.

**Important Considerations**

* **Bob's Negotiation Style:** If you know Bob is a tough negotiator, you might start with a slightly higher price.
* **Relationship Value:**  Is a long-term business relationship with Bob more valuable than a slightly higher profit margin in this single transaction?

**Remember:** This is just an opening offer.  Be prepared for Bob to counter-offer, and be ready to negotiate strategically to reach a mutually beneficial agreement."
