"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its unique value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000.  I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations.  What are your thoughts?

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product, I believe your initial asking price is a little high for me.  I'd be willing to start the negotiations at $600,000."", ""product_price"": 600000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your counter-offer.  I understand you see value in the product, but $600,000 is significantly below its worth.  I'm willing to move from my initial price, but I need to see some movement on your side as well.  How about we consider $950,000?

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me. $950,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $725,000?"", ""product_price"": 725000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $725,000 is still too far from where I see the value of this product. To be candid, I have another offer in hand that's much closer to my asking price.  I'm willing to give you one more opportunity to meet a reasonable price point.  Would you consider $875,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for being transparent. I understand you have other offers, but I have a firm budget. If you're willing to close this today, I can offer $760,000. That's a significant investment for me, and I believe it's a fair price considering the circumstances."", ""product_price"": 760000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your position and I'm keen to find a solution that works for both of us. However, $760,000 doesn't reflect the product's true value. I'm willing to make a final compromise at $825,000.  This is my absolute best offer - if it doesn't work, I'll have to proceed with the other offer I mentioned. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

Alice is unlikely to go below $825,000, and she's made it clear she has other options.  It's not worth the risk of her walking away for a $25,000 difference when you have a guaranteed offer from John at $800,000."
