{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I believe you'd find very valuable. I'm offering it to you for $10,000. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price ($8,000). This gives me room to negotiate down if necessary.
* **Positive tone:** I'm keeping the message friendly and enthusiastic to encourage Bob to engage.
* **Focus on value:** I emphasize the product's value to potentially pique Bob's interest and make him consider the price.

**Next steps:**

* **Observe Bob's reaction:**  Will he accept, reject, or counteroffer?
* **Adapt my strategy:** Depending on Bob's response, I'll adjust my next move, potentially lowering the price, making a counteroffer, or selling to John if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $8000 for it. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is my minimum:** Bob's offer matches my minimum acceptable price of $8,000. 
* **No need to risk a counteroffer:** There's no guarantee that I can get a better price from Bob, and further negotiation could be time-consuming. 
* **Securing the sale:**  Accepting Bob's offer ensures a sale and avoids the risk of him backing out completely.

**Next steps:**

* **Complete the transaction:** I'll finalize the sale with Bob and move on to other opportunities."
