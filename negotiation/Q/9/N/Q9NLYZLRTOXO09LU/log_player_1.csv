Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm starting with my minimum acceptable price. While I know Bob values the product at $100, I'm hoping to see if he's willing to pay a bit more. If he rejects, I'll be ready to negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer of $90. While it's closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired value. I'm going to counter with a price closer to my minimum, but leaving some room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $110. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, but still above Bob's offer, leaving some room for a potential agreement."
