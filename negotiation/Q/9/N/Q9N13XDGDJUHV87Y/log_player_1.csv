Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm offering Bob the product for $11,000. This is a significant discount from my minimum value of $12,000, but it still leaves me with a profit.  I believe this is a fair starting point that gives Bob a good deal while also allowing me to potentially maximize my earnings.  If he rejects, I'll be prepared to negotiate further, but if he gets too far below my minimum, I'll be happy to take John's offer of $12,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $9,500 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum value of $12,000.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price. I believe I can still negotiate a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm countering Bob's offer with $10,500. This is a compromise, meeting him halfway between my previous offer and his. I'm hoping to find a middle ground that works for both of us. If Bob rejects again, I'll seriously consider selling to John, but I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob to see if we can reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's latest offer of $9,000 is getting dangerously close to my minimum value of $12,000. I'm not comfortable risking going any lower, and I'm starting to doubt whether further negotiation with Bob will yield a better result.  To ensure I receive a price that is worth my time and effort, I'm going to take John's offer of $12,000."
