Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be highly beneficial to you.  I'm asking for $11,500, which reflects its significant value."",
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 
 
**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** The goal is to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($12,000) as possible. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting a bit high allows room for Bob to potentially negotiate down,  while still ensuring a profit above John's offer.
* **Confident but Not Greedy:** $11,500 is a strong offer that suggests the product's value while avoiding the risk of alienating Bob by aiming for the absolute maximum. 

If Bob rejects this initial offer, there's still a chance to negotiate further or accept John's offer as a backup."
