Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $900,000 is still a decent amount, I believe I can get closer to my desired price of $1,000,000 by continuing to negotiate.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to be flexible. However, $900,000 is simply too low. Let's compromise. How about $1,050,000?

Round 4
Bob's offer:

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  While we're getting closer, $950,000 is still below my minimum target of $1,000,000. I'll counteroffer again in the next round, aiming for a price closer to my desired value."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $950,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $1,000,000? This is my absolute minimum.  It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close this deal. "", ""product_price"": 1000000}

Round 6
Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

We are at round 6 and Bob's offer is $975,000.  This is still below my target price of $1,000,000.  However, I don't want to risk going through more rounds and potentially ending up with a lower price.  Jhon is offering a guaranteed $1,000,000, so I will sell to him now."
