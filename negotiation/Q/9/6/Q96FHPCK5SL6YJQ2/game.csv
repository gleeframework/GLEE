"Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product! I'm excited to discuss the price with you. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, which is a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in it. What do you think?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at $850,000. Considering the value the product holds for you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $1,100,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's worth considering.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit outside my budget.  I'm prepared to offer $950,000 for the product.  This represents a significant step towards your asking price and is the highest I can go without exceeding my financial limits.  I believe this offer reflects the value we both see in this product.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I understand that $950,000 is still a bit below my target price, but I'm willing to consider it. However, I need to make sure I'm getting a fair deal. I'm willing to meet you at $1,050,000. This is a compromise that I believe reflects the value of the product, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer, but $1,050,000 is still a stretch for me. I'm willing to offer $975,000. This represents a significant compromise on my part and shows how serious I am about acquiring this product. I believe this price fairly reflects both of our interests.",975000.0,Bob,6,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product at $975,000. I'm willing to meet you at $1,075,000. This is the highest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's still a fair deal considering the value the product holds for you.",1075000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,075,000 is still a bit out of reach for me.  I'm going to push my budget to the limit and offer $1,000,000. This is a significant compromise for me, and I believe it reflects a fair value for both of us.  We're both getting closer, and I'm hopeful we can close this deal.",1000000.0,Bob,8,
