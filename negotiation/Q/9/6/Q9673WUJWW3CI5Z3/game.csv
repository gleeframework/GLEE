"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for a special price of $120. I think it's a great value, and I'm confident you'll love it. What do you think?",120.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hey Alice, thanks for the offer, but $120 is a bit steep for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I can only go up to $85 right now. What do you think?",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your offer of $85 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $105. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's still a great deal for you. What do you think?",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $105 is still a bit out of my budget.  I'm happy to meet you at $90. This is my final offer,  let me know if it works for you.",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $90 is still a bit lower than my target price, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $95. This is my final counteroffer. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",95.0,Alice,5,
