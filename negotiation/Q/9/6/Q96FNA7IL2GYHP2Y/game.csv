"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I think you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $120. What do you think?",120.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Can you meet me at that price?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, I'm not sure I can meet you at $100. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer it to you for $110. What do you think?",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit higher than that. Can you consider $105? I think that's a fair price for this product.",105.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see you're really interested in the product, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll offer it to you for $115. This is as low as I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great deal for you.",115.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your concession, Alice, but I'm still not convinced that $115 is the best price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $105 and $115, which would be $110. Can you consider that?",110.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. However, I've already met you halfway between $105 and $115 in my previous offer. I'm willing to make one more move, but I need to think about the value I'm bringing to the table. I'll offer it to you for $118. This is my final concession, and I think it's a fair price for the product.",118.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to make another concession, Alice, but I'm still not convinced that $118 is the best price. I'm willing to meet you at $116. Can you consider that?",116.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting a bit too close to the wire, Bob. I'm not willing to go any lower than $118, and I've already made several concessions. I'm willing to meet you at $117, but that's as low as I can go. What do you think?",117.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $117, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to meet you at $115, and that's my final offer. If you can't meet me at that price, I'll have to consider other options.",115.0,Bob,10,
