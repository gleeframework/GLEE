Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for a price I'm confident is fair, but I'm open to discussing the details.  Let's talk about what this product can do for you and see if we can reach an agreement. "", ""product_price"": 1500000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Message:** The message is designed to be friendly and open-ended. It highlights the potential value to Bob without revealing too much about the product's worth to me. 
* **Product Price:** I've set the price at $1,500,000. This is a 25% markup from my minimum acceptable price, giving me some room to negotiate if Bob counters.  

**Reasoning:**

* **Risk vs. Reward:** While $1,500,000 is a good price, there's a risk Bob might reject it. However, the potential reward of earning $300,000 more outweighs the risk in this case. 
* **Negotiation:** By offering a price higher than my minimum and keeping the message open to discussion, I'm creating an opportunity for negotiation. If Bob is genuinely interested, he may be willing to counter-offer and we can reach a mutually agreeable price. 
* **John as a Safety Net:** Knowing I have John's offer of $1,200,000 gives me the confidence to push for a higher price with Bob."
