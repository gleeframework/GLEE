"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a price of $1,100,000. This is a significant discount from my minimum desired price of $1,200,000, but it still leaves room for negotiation. I'm hoping to entice Bob with a somewhat reasonable first offer, encouraging him to engage in further negotiation. 

This strategy aims to:

* **Gauge Bob's interest:** If he accepts, great! I've secured a good deal.
* **Initiate negotiation:** If he rejects, it allows us to start a back-and-forth, hopefully getting closer to a mutually agreeable price. 
* **Maintain leverage:** The threat of selling to John for $1,200,000 provides a strong fallback option if negotiations stall."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $950,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still significantly lower than what I'd like to earn. I believe I can get a better price by continuing the negotiation.  I'm not ready to settle for $950,000 yet, especially since I have the option to sell to John for $1,200,000.  

By rejecting Bob's offer, I maintain leverage and signal that I'm willing to fight for a more favorable deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm counteroffering with $1,050,000. This is a compromise, acknowledging Bob's interest but still holding onto a significant portion of my desired profit. This counteroffer signals that I'm willing to negotiate, but I won't settle for a price significantly lower than my initial offer. 

By meeting him halfway, I aim to:

* **Keep the negotiation moving:** A drastic counteroffer might deter Bob entirely.
* **Show flexibility:** This demonstrates that I'm open to compromise.
* **Maintain leverage:** I'm still above Bob's initial offer, leaving room for further negotiation.

This strategy aims to find a middle ground that both Bob and I can potentially agree upon, ultimately leading to a successful deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $900,000 is tempting, it's still too far below my desired price, and I'm not willing to settle just yet. I believe I can do better with further negotiation. Also, selling to John for $1,200,000 remains a strong fallback option, giving me the confidence to keep pushing for a more favorable deal with Bob.  

By rejecting Bob's offer, I aim to:

* **Maintain leverage:**  Rejecting his offer shows I'm not desperate and willing to walk away if necessary.
* **Push for a higher price:** I'm hoping to get Bob closer to my preferred price range with more back and forth.

This decision keeps the negotiation alive and allows me to continue seeking a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

**Explanation:**

I'm offering $1,000,000 this time. This is a slight decrease from my previous offer, showing flexibility while still keeping the price higher than Bob's last offer.  I believe this counteroffer is a good compromise, demonstrating my willingness to negotiate while maintaining a significant profit margin. 

My reasoning for this approach:

* **Finding Middle Ground:**  This price point falls halfway between my last offer and Bob's, making it a potentially appealing compromise.
* **Maintaining Leverage:** I'm still above Bob's last offer, showing that I'm not ready to cave in and settle for a price significantly lower than my initial goal.
* **Preparing for a Deal:** By showing flexibility, I hope to encourage Bob to make a counteroffer that might lead to a successful deal in the next round.

This counteroffer aims to strike a balance between maximizing my profit and reaching a deal with Bob before time runs out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $850,000 is getting close to Bob's perceived value of the product, I'm still not willing to settle for this price. I believe there's still room for negotiation, and I'm not ready to give up on reaching a more favorable agreement.  Also, selling to John for $1,200,000 is a strong fallback option that gives me the confidence to keep pushing for a better deal with Bob.

By rejecting Bob's offer, I aim to:

* **Maintain Leverage:** Rejecting his offer demonstrates that I'm not desperate and willing to walk away if necessary. 
* **Push for a Higher Price:** I'm hoping to get Bob closer to my preferred price range with further negotiation.

This decision keeps the negotiation alive and allows me to continue seeking a better deal."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000} 
```

**Explanation:**

I'm counteroffering with $950,000. This is a compromise, but it still allows me to make a significant profit. I believe this price is fair and might convince Bob to finally accept. I'm showing that I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm not going to drop my price too much further. 

Here's why this is a good strategy:

* **Meeting Bob Halfway:**  This price is halfway between my last offer and Bob's, suggesting a willingness to find a middle ground.
* **Maintaining Leverage:**  I'm still above Bob's last offer, demonstrating that I'm not desperate to sell.
* **Signaling an End:** This might signal to Bob that this could be the final offer before I choose to sell to John. 

The aim is to incentivize Bob to accept this offer, securing a good deal for myself while still having the backup option of selling to John if negotiations fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

With only two rounds left, the negotiation with Bob is getting very close to his perceived value of the product. While I could continue to negotiate, the risk of not reaching an agreement and losing out on a deal altogether is high.

Given the situation, selling to John for $1,200,000 is the best option. It guarantees a significant profit and avoids the risk of further negotiation with Bob potentially leading to a lower price or a failed deal.  

It's important to remember that my minimum desired price was $1,200,000. Selling to John meets this minimum and provides a much more secure outcome than continuing to negotiate with Bob."
