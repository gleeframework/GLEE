"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but that price is a bit high for me. Would you consider $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $7,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $9,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair deal for both of us.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. How about we settle at $7,500? That would work for me.",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to my minimum price, but I'm still not comfortable with $7,500. I can do $8,500, but that's as low as I can go. I think it's a great deal for both of us at this price.",8500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're trying to get a fair price. How about we split the difference and make it $8,000? That's a good compromise for both of us.",8000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I think we're getting close, but I'm still not quite there. I can do $9,000, but I'm not sure I can go any lower than that. This is my final offer, and I think it's a great deal for both of us.",9000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, you said $9,000 was your final offer, but I'm hoping we can still find a compromise. I'm willing to go up to $8,200.  Let me know if that works for you.",8200.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $9,000. However, I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal. I'll include a free maintenance package worth $1,000. So, the total value you'll get is $10,000. I think this is a great deal for both of us.",9000.0,Alice,9,
