Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly.  Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $14,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** I aim for a price significantly higher than my minimum ($12,000) but below Bob's perceived value ($15,000).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $14,000 leaves space for potential counter-offers from Bob while still securing a significant profit. 
* **Time Sensitivity:**  Mentioning listing it publicly creates a subtle sense of urgency, potentially motivating Bob to act quickly."
