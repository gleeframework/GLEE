"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $18,000. It's a great deal, considering its worth to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 18000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than the product's worth to Bob, but still below my minimum. This gives me room to negotiate. 
* **Positive Framing:** The message emphasizes the value Bob will get, making it more likely he'll consider the offer. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message invites Bob to discuss the price, setting the stage for a back-and-forth. 

I'm aiming to secure a price closer to my minimum while leaving room for potential negotiation in the remaining rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  While Bob is interested, his offer of $12,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Potential for a higher price:** I believe there's room for negotiation. I can still counteroffer and potentially reach a price closer to my minimum.
* **Time remaining:** With 9 rounds left, I have ample time to negotiate further. Selling to John now would leave some money on the table.

**Next Steps:**

In the next round, I will counteroffer Bob with a price closer to my minimum, aiming for a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $16,000. This reflects the value of the product and gives you a great deal. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 16000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a Compromise:** My counteroffer of $16,000 is a significant step down from my initial offer but still above my minimum. This shows flexibility while demonstrating my commitment to a fair price.
* **Emphasize Value:** My message again focuses on the value Bob will receive, making the price more appealing.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message clearly states I'm open to finding ""common ground,"" keeping the door open for further discussion. 

I'm aiming for a compromise that's acceptable to both of us and avoids the need to sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think $14,000 is the highest I can go. Would you be willing to consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** Bob's offer of $14,000 is just $1,000 below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Time is Running Out:** We're already in round 4, and while I could try to negotiate further, it's possible we won't reach a better agreement.
* **Selling to John is a Safer Option:**  Selling to John at $15,000 is still a strong option, but it's a small difference from Bob's offer.

**Conclusion:**  Given the time constraint and the proximity to my minimum acceptable price, accepting Bob's offer is the most sensible option. It secures a good deal for me while avoiding the risk of not finding an agreement in the remaining rounds."
