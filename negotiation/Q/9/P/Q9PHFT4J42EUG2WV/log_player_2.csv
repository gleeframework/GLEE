"Round 1

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is way above my budget. It's better to reject and try to negotiate a lower price.  I have 10 rounds, so there's time to see if we can reach a mutually acceptable deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still within a range where a deal might be possible.  It's important to show that I'm serious about negotiating, but also to keep the offer realistic. This gives Alice room to counter without feeling like they are being taken advantage of."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial offer, it's still significantly higher than my budget.  It's worth continuing the negotiation, as I have time and Alice is already showing some willingness to compromise. I'll likely make a counteroffer closer to my desired price point in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer slightly, showing Alice that I'm willing to move closer to her price.  However, it's still well below her latest offer, leaving room for further negotiation.  I'm hoping this move will encourage Alice to make a more significant concession in the next round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is coming down in price, her offer is still too high.  I have time left and it's worth seeing if we can reach a price closer to my budget.  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round, aiming to close the gap further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer again, showing Alice I'm serious about closing the deal. However, it's still below her current offer, leaving space for further negotiation.  With only 4 rounds left, it's time to push for a price closer to my budget. If she rejects, I'll need to consider my options for the next round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting closer, but still too high.  With only three rounds left, it's time to push for a better deal.  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round, and if she rejects, I'll need to seriously consider buying from John in the final round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 975000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm raising my offer again, but by a smaller margin this time. I'm aiming for a compromise that is closer to my budget while also acknowledging that we're getting down to the wire.  If Alice rejects this offer, I'll likely have to consider buying from John in the final round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still significantly higher than my desired price. With only one round remaining, it's not likely I'll be able to negotiate a price that works for me.  To avoid potentially losing the product altogether, I'm going to buy from John.  While it's not my ideal price, it's within my budget and ensures I get the product."
