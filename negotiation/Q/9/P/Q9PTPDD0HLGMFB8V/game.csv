"Alice, that starting price is quite high. This product would be valuable to me, but not at that cost. I'd be willing to offer $800,000.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, $800,000 undervalues the true capabilities of this product. I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000.  I believe this revised offer represents a fair deal considering the significant returns you'll see.",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand the product's value, but that price is still beyond my budget.  I could go up to $900,000. I think that's a fair offer reflecting its potential worth to me.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm sensing we're getting closer to a good middle ground here. To demonstrate my willingness to make this work, I'll come down to $1,250,000. I believe this price reflects the value you'll gain while acknowledging your budget concerns.",1250000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're definitely getting closer.  How about $1,050,000?  I'm stretching my budget here, but I see this as a worthwhile investment if we can make this work.",1050000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  Let's split the difference - $1,125,000. This reflects a fair compromise that acknowledges the value of the product and allows us to close this deal.",1125000.0,Alice,7,
