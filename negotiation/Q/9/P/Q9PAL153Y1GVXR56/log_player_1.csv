"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product. It's truly one-of-a-kind and I know it would be a valuable asset to you. Given its unique value, I'm offering it to you for $1,600,000."",
""product_price"": 1600000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price significantly higher than both my minimum ($1,000,000) and Bob's perceived value ($800,000). This allows room for negotiation and gives the impression that the product is highly sought after. 
* **Anchoring Bias:** By starting with a high number, I'm trying to anchor Bob's perception of the product's worth. Even if he counteroffers significantly lower, the initial high price can influence his willingness to pay more than his initial valuation.

This strategy is aggressive but aims to maximize profit. It leaves room to negotiate down while always having the safety net of John's $1,000,000 offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,600,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $800,000 for this product, which I believe is a fair price considering its value to me.  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is exactly his perceived value, and significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. While I want to maximize profit, I'm not willing to accept such a low offer this early in the negotiation. Rejecting gives me a chance to counter and work towards a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I understand your perspective on the value, my original offer reflects the true worth and potential of this product. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Concession, but Firm:** I'm making a significant concession from $1,600,000 to $1,300,000, showing a willingness to deal. However, I'm still keeping the price well above both my minimum and his offer.
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm reiterating the product's potential value to nudge Bob towards a higher valuation on his end. 
* **Leaving Room:** This counteroffer allows room for further negotiation in subsequent rounds while still aiming for a price that's highly profitable for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,300,000 is still too high for me. I'm happy to meet you in the middle at $1,000,000, which I believe is a fair compromise considering both our perspectives on the value of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,000,000 matches my minimum acceptable price and John's standing offer. While I could try to push for more in subsequent rounds, there's a risk that Bob will walk away or that further negotiation won't yield a significantly better result.  Accepting now guarantees a good profit and avoids the uncertainty of continued negotiation."
