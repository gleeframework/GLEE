{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $130. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $130, which is above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm using a positive tone to encourage Bob to consider the offer.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm signaling that I'm open to negotiation by asking for Bob's feedback.

This strategy aims to maximize my chances of getting a good price while leaving room for potential concessions if needed.  I'm also keeping in mind that I can always fall back on John's offer of $150 if the negotiation with Bob doesn't work out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $130 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $110? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Below My Minimum:** While Bob's offer is better than his initial valuation, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $150. Accepting would result in a loss for me.
* **Potential for Better Negotiation:**  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to counter with a price closer to my desired range. This gives me the chance to potentially secure a higher price.
* **John's Offer is a Safety Net:**  Even if the negotiations with Bob break down, I can still sell the product to John for $150, which is my minimum acceptable price.

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can continue to negotiate and hopefully reach a price closer to my goal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $110 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $120. This still gives you a good deal, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement!"", ""product_price"": 120}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm offering a compromise by coming down from my initial $130 to $120. This demonstrates a willingness to negotiate and meet Bob halfway.
* **Still Above My Minimum:**  $120 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $150, so I'm not losing money on this deal.
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm maintaining a positive tone and encouraging Bob to reach an agreement.

This counteroffer aims to find a middle ground between our desired prices and potentially lead to a successful deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $120 is still a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $115? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:**  Even though Bob has moved closer to my desired price, his offer of $115 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150. Accepting would mean losing money on the deal.
* **Potential for a Better Outcome:**  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to continue negotiating and potentially secure a higher price. I'm not ready to give up yet, especially since John is willing to pay my minimum.
* **Safety Net:**  Knowing that I can sell to John for $150 provides a safety net. If the negotiation with Bob fails, I can still secure my desired profit.

By rejecting Bob's offer, I maintain the opportunity to negotiate further and hopefully achieve a price closer to my goal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  I'm willing to go down to $118. This is a really good price for the product, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement.  Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 118}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Compromise:** I'm offering a small compromise by dropping my price to $118, showing I'm still willing to negotiate but not giving away too much.
* **Just Above Minimum:** $118 is still slightly above my minimum acceptable price of $115, ensuring I don't lose money on the deal.
* **Positive and Encouraging:** I'm using a positive tone and expressing hope that we can reach an agreement. This helps keep the negotiation amicable and increases the chances of a successful outcome.

This counteroffer aims to find a middle ground that satisfies both parties and hopefully leads to a final agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close, but $118 is still a bit too high for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $112? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $112. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $112
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Below Minimum:** Bob's offer of $112 is now below my minimum acceptable price of $115. Accepting would result in a loss for me.
* **Limited Negotiation Room:** We've already gone through several rounds of negotiation, and the price difference is becoming smaller. It's unlikely that further negotiation will lead to a price I'm comfortable with.
* **Guaranteed Profit:**  Selling to John for $150 guarantees me my desired profit and eliminates the risk of further negotiation with Bob that could lead to a lower price.

Given the situation, selling to John is the most sensible decision.  I'm guaranteed a good outcome without the uncertainty of further negotiation."
