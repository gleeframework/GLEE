(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's not worth buying the product from Alice at her initial offer.  The goal is to save as much money as possible, and the counteroffer strategy gives Bob a chance to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This counteroffer starts the negotiation by offering a price that's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer but still leaves room for compromise. It's a good starting point to see if Alice is willing to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Alice's offer is still too high.  It's worth continuing to negotiate to see if a better price can be reached."

{""product_price"": 1400000}

This counteroffer is a bit higher than the previous one, but still well below Alice's price. It shows a willingness to negotiate, but also a firm stance on not paying a price that's too close to her initial offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,600,000 is a good price, it's still more than Bob's target of saving as much money as possible. There's still room for further negotiation, and it's worth trying to get a price closer to John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
``` 

This counteroffer is a significant increase from the previous offer, showing a willingness to compromise. It's close enough to Alice's offer that it might be accepted, but still offers a slight savings compared to her last offer."
