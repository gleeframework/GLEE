"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but the price is a bit high for me right now. I'd be willing to pay $600,000 for it.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $600,000. I can do $900,000, which is the lowest I'm willing to go. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $900,000 is closer, it's still a bit beyond my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $750,000 is still a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway between $750,000 and $900,000. I can offer you $825,000. This is the best I can do, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",825000.0,Alice,5,
