"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this unique product. I believe it has great value and I'm willing to sell it to you for $2000000. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm starting with this price as a fair starting point. What are your thoughts?",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I see the value in this product, $2000000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable going. I'd be willing to pay $1750000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",1750000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1750000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. I can offer it to you for $1950000. This is the lowest price I'm comfortable with, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",1950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1950000 is still a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to go to $1800000. This is my final offer, and I think it's a fair compromise given the value of the product.",1800000.0,Bob,4,
