Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested but  $950,000 is a bit too high for me. How about we settle around $700,000? I believe that's a fair price that benefits us both. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000

This price is still fair and leaves room for a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 850000}

Round 4

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you're tough!  I'm willing to go up slightly, but $825,000 is pushing it.  How about we agree on $800,000? That's a significant investment for me, but I'm confident in the product's value.
