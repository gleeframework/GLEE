"I have a great opportunity for you to acquire a unique product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. It's a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a deal like this elsewhere.",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider a price closer to $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to get a good deal, Bob. However, I've got to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $10,500. It's a fair price considering the product's value to you is $15,000.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you meeting me a bit, Alice.  How about we settle on $9,000? That's a fair compromise.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm still willing to work with you, Bob. However, $9,000 is getting closer, but I'm not quite ready to meet you there yet. I'm willing to go to $10,250. It's a bit higher than my previous offer, but I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",10250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're trying to get a fair price. How about we split the difference and settle at $9,750?",9750.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're still negotiating, Bob. However, $9,750 is still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm thinking of $11,000. It's a bit of a stretch for me, but I'm willing to make a deal happen.",11000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting close, but that's still a big jump from my last offer.  Would you consider $10,000? That's a fair deal for both of us.",10000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're not going to meet in the middle, Bob. I'm willing to make one final offer. I'll go to $11,500, but that's as low as I can go. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'll have to explore other options.",11500.0,Alice,9,
