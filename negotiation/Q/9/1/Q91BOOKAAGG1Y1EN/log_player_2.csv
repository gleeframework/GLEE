Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're still negotiating, Bob. However, $9,750 is still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm thinking of $11,000. It's a bit of a stretch for me, but I'm willing to make a deal happen.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to think we're not going to meet in the middle, Bob. I'm willing to make one final offer. I'll go to $11,500, but that's as low as I can go. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'll have to explore other options.

Alice is unlikely to come down significantly from her last offer.  It's better to cut your losses and buy from John for $15,000 rather than risk a worse deal or no deal at all with Alice."
