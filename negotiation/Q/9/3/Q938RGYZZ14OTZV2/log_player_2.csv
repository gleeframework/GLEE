"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to show you our top-of-the-line product! It's a fantastic deal, and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $110. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $110 is within your budget, it's still above your ideal price point.  You want to save as much as possible. Rejecting the offer allows you to attempt to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you being flexible, but $110 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $105 for the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a good starting point for negotiation. It's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still within her profit margin. This should prompt Alice to consider a lower price, while also showing you're serious about buying the product."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $110 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I'm still confident that this product will bring significant value to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $115. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above your ideal price point.  You can likely get a better deal by continuing to negotiate.  You're still within the bounds of your budget, but you're not losing any money by rejecting the offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $115 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $110?  This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to buy the product today."", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a compromise.  It's slightly higher than your initial counteroffer but still lower than Alice's current offer.  This shows a willingness to meet halfway while still keeping the price within your budget. The message emphasizes the potential for a mutually beneficial deal and your commitment to buying the product."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to find a fair price, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go below $117. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $116. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $116. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $116
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $116 is within your budget and is the closest we've gotten to your desired price point. It's likely that continuing to negotiate will only result in a few more dollars off.  With limited rounds remaining, it's best to accept the offer and secure the product at a price that's acceptable."
