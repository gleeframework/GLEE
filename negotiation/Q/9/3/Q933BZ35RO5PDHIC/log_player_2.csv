"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $180. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is far too high. It's important to negotiate towards a price that works for you, especially since you have John as a backup option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider a price closer to $60."",
""product_price"": 60
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** This counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's asking price, but it establishes a starting point for negotiation. 
* **Leaving Room to Negotiate:** By starting low, I have room to increase my offer gradually if Alice is unwilling to accept such a low price.
* **Backup Plan in Mind:** I know I can always buy the product from John for $80, so I'm not desperate to close a deal with Alice at any cost."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. However, I have to make a living, and $60 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $120. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above Budget:** While Alice moved closer to my price, $120 is still significantly more than my $80 budget and the guaranteed $80 from John. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** Her willingness to negotiate suggests there's still potential for a better price. I need to push further to see how low she's willing to go."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me. How about we try $75? That's a fair bit closer to your price and would allow me to buy from you today."",
""product_price"": 75
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Increase:** This counteroffer shows Alice I'm willing to move significantly from my initial low offer.
* **Still Below Budget:**  $75 keeps me below my $80 maximum and leaves a little wiggle room for a final counter from Alice.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  By suggesting I could ""buy from you today,"" I hint at the possibility of accepting quickly if the price is right."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad you're still interested in the product, Bob! I can see you're willing to meet me halfway, but I'm still not at $75. How about we try $140? It's a bit higher than your last offer, but I think it's a fair price for this great product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is Not Budging:** Alice increased her price after my counter-offer, indicating she's unlikely to meet my budget.
* **John is the Safe Bet:**  John offers a guaranteed price of $80, well within my budget.  It's time to cut my losses with Alice and take the sure thing."
